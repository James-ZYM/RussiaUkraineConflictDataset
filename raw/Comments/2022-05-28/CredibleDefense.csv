Indeed, but that was the last war South Korea fought, and it ended in 1953. Mean while China was having wars with the US and the Soviet Union all the way up until 1970. Of course, it was under a permanent embargo by the US for this entire time.

First, I think people massively underestimate how many arms the US can ship while also being utterly apathetic.  It took us 20 years to get bored of spilling blood and treasure in Afghanistan.  And pulling out was controversial.  In Ukraine, no US blood is being spilled.  And we've mostly been shipping old stocks of stuff we were eventually going to replace anyway.  We've accelerated the plan to replace Javelin and Stinger by a few years, but that isn't very significant in the grand scheme of things.  There has actually been fairly little direct spending in support of Ukraine so far.  We can sleepwalk through our current level of support for another 20 years even easier than we did in Afghanistan.  The US arms industry has a ton of PAC money to use supporting politicians who don't get in the way of Defending Democracy.

Second, countries like Poland simply won't get bored and apathetic with a major war directly on their border.  Countries in the region see Russian aggression as a direct threat.  So even if the US and most partners does have a political shift and abandons Ukraine, Ukraine will still have way more GDP supporting it than fighting against it.

Russia doesn't care about Ukraine more than Poland cares about Poland.

*The secret planning that kept the White House a step ahead of Russia*

https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/05/26/biden-white-house-secret-planning-helped-ukraine-counter-russia/

The first instruction that Secretary of State Antony Blinken got from President Biden was to “reset” America’s alliances and partnerships abroad so that the United States could deal with the challenges ahead. That strategy would prove decisive in combating Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.

Sign up for a weekly roundup of thought-provoking ideas and debates
Blinken and other officials gave me new details this week, describing a series of behind-the-scenes meetings over the past year that helped forge the U.S.-led coalition to support Ukraine. His narrative validates President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s observation in a 1957 speech: “Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.”

The Biden administration’s secret planning began in April 2021 when Russia massed about 100,000 troops on the Ukrainian border. The buildup turned out to be a feint, but Blinken and other officials discussed U.S. intelligence about Russia’s actions with leaders of Britain, France and Germany at a NATO meeting in Brussels that month. Their message was, “We need to get ourselves prepared,” a senior State Department official said.

Germany was a reluctant but essential ally, and the Biden administration made a controversial decision last summer that was probably crucial in gaining German support against Russia. Biden gave Germany a pass on an initial round of sanctions against a company building the Nord Stream 2 pipeline in exchange for a pledge from Chancellor Angela Merkel that if Russia invaded, Nord Stream 2 would be scrapped. When the invasion came, Merkel was gone but her successor, Olaf Scholz, kept the promise.

By avoiding a crisis with Germany early on, Blinken said, “the net result was that the foundation was in place when the Russians went ahead with the aggression.”

This U.S. diplomacy gets high marks from Emily Haber, the German ambassador to Washington. “The wording in the joint statement [about Nord Stream] was vague, but the administration trusted the old — and later the new — chancellor to follow up on it. Which is what happened,” she told me. “A sublime form, I thought, of partnership management.”

The Ukraine threat got red-hot in October, when the United States gathered intelligence about a renewed Russian buildup on the border, along with “some detail about what Russian plans for those forces actually were,” Blinken said. This operational detail “was really the eye opener.” The Group of 20 nations were meeting at the end of October in Rome, and Biden pulled aside the leaders of Britain, France and Germany and gave them a detailed readout on the top-secret evidence.

“It was galvanizing enough that there was an agreement … to fleshing out the consequences for Russia if it went ahead with the aggression,” Blinken said.

CIA Director William J. Burns traveled to Moscow on Nov. 1 to warn President Vladimir Putin that the United States and its allies were prepared to arm Ukraine and impose crippling sanctions on Russia if he invaded. Putin apparently thought Biden wouldn’t be able to deliver.

Persuading Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to take the invasion danger seriously wasn’t easy, initially. Blinken spoke to him at the COP 21 climate summit in Glasgow in early November and provided a summary of intelligence about Russia’s plans. “I basically had the task of telling him that we thought it was likely that his country was going to be invaded,” Blinken recalled. Zelensky was skeptical, according to a State Department official.

Threatening sanctions can be an empty diplomatic ritual. But in December, Blinken and his colleagues began seriously discussing with allies what steps they would take. The initial venue was a Group of Seven foreign ministers meeting in Liverpool, England, on Dec. 11. The attendees publicly committed that there would be “massive consequences and severe costs,” Blinken remembered. As a result, he said, “when the aggression actually happened, we were able to move immediately.”

NATO military planning accelerated along with the diplomacy. Air Force Gen. Tod Wolters, the NATO commander, told me that his colleagues began preparing in December and January the “ground lines of communication” that would allow rapid shipment of arms into Ukraine. They studied entry points for supplies and other practical details. This weapons pipeline delivered Stinger and Javelin missiles before the invasion began Feb. 24 and has transferred huge numbers of heavier weapons since then.

U.S. intelligence provided Ukraine with a preview of Putin’s battle plan. Though Russia had surrounded Ukraine with 150,000 troops, Putin’s real strategy was a lightning, decapitating strike on Kyiv by a relatively small group of elite special forces. The Russians planned to seize Antonov Airport in Hostomel, west of the capital, and then use it to quickly pump troops into Kyiv.

The Ukrainians knew the Russians were coming. Burns had secretly traveled to Kyiv in January to brief Zelensky on the Russian plan, according to two knowledgeable officials. The Ukrainians used the U.S. intelligence to devastate the attacking force at Hostomel, in what may turn out to be the decisive battle of the war. “The Russians had no Plan B,” explained Marek Menkiszak, a Polish intelligence analyst with the Centre for Eastern Studies in Warsaw.

Menkiszak explained the significance of the intelligence coup that revealed the decapitation plan: “The Russians trapped themselves. … It was not meant to be a full-scale war but a special operation” that would topple Zelensky’s government and install a pliant, pro-Moscow regime.

Through the buildup to war, Biden sometimes seemed to misspeak. But he had a clear-eyed view of the evolving strategic terrain. Early on, for example, Biden concluded that the best way to derail Putin’s hope for dividing NATO would be the accession of two strong new members, Finland and Sweden.

Biden wooed Finnish President Sauli Niinisto. He called him in December and then in January to talk about the Russian threat, Blinken said. Biden then invited Niinisto to visit the White House in March, and while they were sitting in the Oval Office, Biden suggested they call Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson, reaching her late at night. By May, the two were visiting the White House together, celebrating their countries’ plans to join NATO.

The Biden administration’s organization of this coalition to support Ukraine may look simple in retrospect. But it was a complicated coordination of diplomatic, military and intelligence resources that pulled together dozens of nations at what may prove to be a hinge point in modern history. Putin thought he could roll through Biden and the West to an easy victory in Kyiv. The Russian leader made a catastrophic mistake in overvaluing his own strength and underestimating the resolve of Biden and his team.",370de499533700191f5546c55ca68defb9781bbc,True,False,,,,,0,1653775710,,0,{},iad0ecq,False,t3_uzluo0,False,True,t3_uzluo0,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uzluo0/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_28_2022/iad0ecq/,1653775725,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653746910.0,

So i strongly doubt that the US will become apathetic. 

Regarding eastern europe, there is zero chance that they will stop supporting ukraine regardless of what happens. 

And the conflict has truly shaken western europe to its core, and silenced the pacifists who argued that the era of war in europe was over. Western europe has also supported ukraine troughout the conflict, and highly doubt that will chance soon. After all both france, germany and Italy are sending 155mm artillery.

One of the volunteers had an older AK-47 which fires 7.62x39, and he difficulty getting magazines and ammo for it. So I would bet that 5.45x39 and 5.56x45 and ammunition is by far the most common, with magazines being either for the AKM or STANAG. 

I have not seen minimi/m249 in the war as I can recall. But I would be surprised if it is not already over there. Most machine guns have been m240s and PKs.

In the Future . . .

* There will be more crises like Ukraine that pull in great powers, spark escalation risks based on fear and uncertainty, and test the viability of integrated deterrence.

* The longer a conflict such as Ukraine lasts, the less likely it will be confined to one state.

* The national security community will need to develop tools and techniques for assessing competition, escalation tendencies, and risk attitudes among foreign leaders that combine old concepts from political psychology with new capabilities afforded by data science and natural language processing.

Based on three crisis simulations held in late March 2022 with think tank fellows, military planners, and congressional staffers, The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will likely struggle to address escalation vectors almost certain to push the current war in Ukraine beyond the country’s borders. This paper captures key insights from across these simulations based on two triggering events: (1) a Russian surgical strike on a NATO logistics hub used to provide weapons to Ukraine in southeast Poland, and (2) Russian use of chemical weapons along the Polish border while simultaneously mobilizing to threaten the Baltics. As the conflict crossed a key threshold and risked becoming a regional war, most participants found a natural pull to escalate in each scenario despite limited expectations of achieving a position of competitive advantage. Analyzing how individuals and teams approached decisionmaking provides insights on rethinking escalation models in the twenty-first century and taking advantage of new concepts and capabilities to better support signaling during a crisis.

----------------------

&gt; * What are the escalation risks in a protracted Ukrainian conflict and how should U.S. policymakers navigate them? Building on previous crisis simulations that evaluated emergent risks in contemporary great power competition, this paper explores how the current conflict could expand. 5 

&gt; * There is still a distinct possibility of escalation in Ukraine. Of the 44 rungs in Herman Kahn’s foundational escalation ladder, the first 20 are nonnuclear and range from sub-crisis maneuvering (e.g., political warfare and gray zone activity) to a spasm or insensate war involving full nuclear exchange.6 

&gt; * Three crisis simulations held in late March 2022 put over 60 players, each with at least 10years of national security experience, in the position of making political-military decisions in response to further escalation in Ukraine.9 

&gt; * In the initial planning round, 29 percent of U.S./NATO teams opted to increase weapons transfers to Ukraine…

&gt; *  …16 percent opted for a surgical strike on Russian forces in Ukraine, as opposed to Belarus, to contain the conflict. 

&gt; * The chart illustrates how even rational planners began to make suboptimal choices where their own assessments of risk outweighed their estimates of the bargaining advantage to be gained by employing flexible deterrent options. Calibrating a balanced deterrent response proved difficult. 

&gt; * Both sides stated they wanted an “off ramp” and a means of pushing the conflict back into territorial Ukraine to avoid a broader, multifront war, although they were unwilling to signal it to the adversary. 

&gt; * The second vignette also illustrated a dangerous tendency toward unintended horizontal escalation over the course of a protracted conflict, even when participants stated they wanted to keep the conflict contained to one country. 

&gt; * Unlike the Cold War, nuclear-armed states in a multipolar world will likely use nonnuclear weapons (e.g., cruise missiles, space capabilities, and cyber operations) to produce strategic effects. 
&gt; * Second, the national security community needs to expand how it plans and tests flexible deterrent options to increase self-awareness about changing risk attitudes and better calibrate response options in a crisis.

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"""Stay and rot"" is a rather poor way of describing what should be ""perform or out"" system, which is how most businesses actually work. People find a job they like that pays well enough and they try to stay in it as long as they can, hoping for pay raises along the way, doing what is necessary to keep the job and not be fired. Management supervises them to ensure they are doing at least the minimum requirements for the job, and if they don't, they are replaced. It lacks the focus on careerism, politics, and gaming the promotion system of the up-or-out system. It often results in an older workforce, not exactly bad for the business world or even the military where age equals maturity and experience. 

Its chief downside is the organization's inability to function in a high attrition environment where they lose a lot of their workforce at one time for whatever reason, as their internal SOP and business model hinges on a cohesive team of highly experienced employees. Nowhere is that more evident than in warfare. 

If someone builds a military manning system where they rely on long standing professionals down to the junior enlisted level, especially at the NCO and officer level, and they suffer very high casualties, they cannot spend a decade to replace them, they need to replace them ASAP to keep functioning. Their previous effectiveness plummets because everything was built on a highly trained force structure that cannot be maintained when performance drops, which means they might not even be able to perform their own doctrine. A perfect example is the the Germans in WW2. The Reichswehr, while small, was probably the most elite conventional military force in modern history. It expanded into the pre-war Wehrmacht and some some turbulence but then gained the experience of the early years of WW2 when they saw lots of success in Poland and France with very low numbers of casualties. But then that force was essentially destroyed in Russia. Unfortunately, the German system didn't create an effective replacement system to keep up high performance levels, which meant by 1943 they were self reporting that they were grossly unable to perform operations as they had only the year before. 

Also, I'd not use modern corporate America as a good example for effective staffing systems, as they are notoriously toxic and unstable. 

Academia is just as bad, I've never heard of anybody finishing grad school without at least bordering on a nervous breakdown, tenured professors who treat their grad students like dirt because they can get away with it and because it happened to them.

I am looking back at predictions from 2-3 months ago from fairly credible experts like Michael Kofman, and I am not sure what about the current situation was inaccurately predicted. If anything, their appraisals of Russia’s outlook for the Donbas offense was too optimistic: multiple times now the area of operations for the front has gotten smaller and smaller, and the goalposts for a successful operation have been shifted further and further back. In March we had some people predicting virtually the entirety of the Ukrainian military was going to be encircled in the Donbas. Now, we are talking about the Russian military capturing all of Luhansk by perhaps mid June, and we have people on twitter acting like the Ukrainian state is on the verge of disintegration. 

What changed? From my perspective, the Ukrainian military has successfully reduced the Russian area of operations to a small portion of the eastern front, the vast bulk of their best units and equipment are in no danger of encirclement and destruction, and they have inflicted an extreme manpower and equipment cost on Russia for the territory that has been on. Lyman seems like a perfect example of this: it was an exposed bridgehead on the eastern side of the river that that essentially a rearguard action that lasted months, how is that a crushing victory for the Russian military?

For 30+ years it's taken this pragmatic neo-liberal perspective that it can use its huge economic power to slowly affect international political change without hard political or military interventions. Over the last 5 years that position has become increasingly untenable, as it turned out that totalitarian capitalism can apparently be stable (China, Russia, MENA countries, etc.), the EU starts to ask some hard questions that need Germany to pick a side (Poland, Hungary – dealing with outside parties like the UK, Turkey), and as it became increasingly clear that Germany could not rely on the United States to offer a military solution to all of Europe's security wants.

But there also isn't a unified perspective in Germany on what a new international position should look like. The center-right CDU and center-left SPD (Scholz's party) rode that stable/boring ""we'll conqueror them through trade"" approach through all those years, the architects of those plans are still part of the political establishment, and they're extremely hesitant to switch gears. The German left tend to be strongly against all foreign interventions, and the German far-right are self-centered nationalists who don't have a coherent international vision anyways.

My maths is wet finger in the air but the extra revenue will be no more than $50b (and probably significantly less) which is nowhere near enough to pay for the war.

Ukraine has a massive potential manpower advantage, that advantage will take time to bring to bare but Russia had no way of matching without full mobilisation (which it can't afford).

The West will donate advance weapons which give the Ukrainians significant tactical advantages.

The outcome of this war is almost entirely dependent on the Ukrainian will to fight.

Ah yes, an annual GDP contraction of ""only"" 30%. No biggie. In all seriousness though, Ukrainians will endure what they must because this is a war for their very survival as a country.

&gt;The $40 billion the Ukrainians received from the US is a drop in the bucket compared to the $1bil per day the Russians are earning from the energy sector. They will reinvest this into the war.

Russia has more to pay for than just the war. Their imports and exports are currently collapsing, oil and gas revenues really don't make up for that entirely.

After taking most of those IDF defenses the Egyptians moved additional units across the canal (2+ mechanized divisions) and then pushed out to the mountain passes east of the Suez canal to establish defensive positions to oppose a single brigade of IDF tanks, unsupported by infantry or artillery, who conducted a series of rash and extremely poorly planned, coordinated, and executed piecemeal counterattacks where ran into the new Egyptian defensive line consisting of tanks, ATGMs, and RPGs, which slaughtered that counterattack. That was followed by a larger IDF armor division sized counterattack that was also executed very poorly (company here, company there), with zero positive results.

It wasn't until the full IDF reserve was called up that they had the numbers to even challenge the Egyptians, and their success was a mix of Egyptian over exuberance, deciding to change the plan to drive deeper east and outside the range of their air defenses (where Israel ground air counterattacks had more success), and then the IDF bypassing most of the new Egyptian defensive line to cross the Suez to threaten them with encirclement.",5e6a50496fb003ead4abe4006c61ded795e35957,True,False,,,,,0,1653756512,,0,{},iabw09j,False,t3_uxwg8c,False,True,t1_ia9km5b,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uxwg8c/the_battlefields_of_the_donbass_and_beyond/iabw09j/,1653756529,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653727712.0,

&gt;The $40 billion the Ukrainians received from the US is a drop in the bucket compared to the $1bil per day the Russians are earning from the energy sector. They will reinvest this into the war.

The energy sector doing well does not offset the problems other sectors have. To say Russia will reinvest their energy earnings into the war requires they have the ability to produce much of what they need domestically or import it easily and can get it to the front in enough time for it to matter. 

Additional factors are if they decide to fully mobilize or not, how much economic retooling is required, the current status of industries related to defense, if or how corruption will impact the situation, and other things that I don't know or can't think of at the moment.

It also is interesting that the tensions are high enough right now that China is applying pressure by frequently flying in Taiwan's air defense space. The infrastructure outlined in the paper here is put to constant use, and is ill suited for a high intensity conflict. 

--------------------

Introduction:

Shows of force from China’s People’s Liberation Army exist on a continuum from peace to war and can be characterized as coercive or annihilative. In this report, Executive Director Mark Stokes and Associate Director of Programs Eric Lee examine kinetic and non-kinetic threats posed to Taiwan by the People’s Liberation Army. The authors explore the history of Taiwan’s early warning infrastructure and radar order of battle. They then assess how these capabilities support Taiwan’s air sovereignty missions of surveillance and control around its territories. They conclude by suggesting ways the United States can bolster Taiwan’s early warning capabilities.

------------------------

&gt; * Early warning systems are critical at each point along the peace-war continuum. 

&gt; * Taiwan relies mostly on radar for early warning.2 

&gt; * However, any ground-based system will have limitations on the ability to provide early warning against cruise missiles and other low flying, low observable flight vehicles. Powerful radars constructed on airborne early warning aircraft fill such critical gaps.4 

&gt; * Coercion succeeds when Taiwan’s political leadership concedes to Beijing’s demands under armed duress, despite retaining the power to resist. 

&gt; * At the low end of the spectrum, the CMC routinely calibrates shows of force for strategic effect. 

&gt; * A maritime blockade would seek to isolate Taiwan by attacking its sea lines of communication into and out of ports. An air blockade could forcibly bring the Taipei Flight Information Region (FIR) under Shanghai or establish and enforce a no-fly zone over Taiwan. An air blockade also could support a broader campaign to attain information dominance. Judicious application of firepower, combined with electromagnetic spectrum operations, cyber, operations security, and deception presumably would seek to paralyze Taiwan’s command and control system and its ability to mount an organized resistance. Strategic-level targets likely would include early warning radar systems, national and operational-level command and control centers, communications nodes, critical infrastructure, and any deep interdiction assets. PLA writings suggest heavy reliance upon surprise and pre-emption to shock leaders in Taiwan, paralyze the ability to conduct operations, and to force a political solution soon after initiation of hostilities. 

&gt; * The CCP has outlined seven triggers for employment of non-peaceful means to advance its political goals: 1) actions resulting in Taiwan’s permanent separation from China; 2) sustained refusal to engage in cross-Strait negotiations; 3) internal chaos in Taiwan; 4) a drastic deterioration of Taiwan’s armed forces and operational readiness; 5) permanent basing of U.S. or other foreign military forces on Taiwan; 6) Taiwan’s deployment of nuclear weapons; and 7) subverting CCP legitimacy through direct promotion of democracy or other measures.10 

&gt; * The PLA Rocket Force (PLARF) presents the most significant kinetic challenge to Taiwan’s early warning and command and control system. 

&gt; * A typical ballistic missile with a 300-kilometer range has a flight time of approximately five minutes.18 Therefore, since 2007, any unhardened structure on Taiwan has been within seven minutes of destruction. 

&gt; * A missile campaign would be followed by conventional PLA Air Force (PLAAF) strikes to ensure air defenses remain suppressed. 

&gt; * If the PLA is successful in operating in the skies over Taiwan with impunity, conditions are created for a maritime blockade or an amphibious invasion. 

&gt; * Electromagnetic spectrum operations would be central to a PLA coercive campaign directed against Taiwan. 

&gt; * Early warning allows national-level command authorities to forecast, monitor, and assess national security threats, and determine appropriate countermeasures. 

&gt; * Taiwan’s ADIZ is a declared geographic area extending beyond its territorial airspace. It is a designated airspace within which aircraft are required to comply with special identification procedures.25 Flight activity within the area is monitored and assessed for its potential threat to national security. 

&gt; * An ADIZ supports the air sovereignty mission. 

&gt; * Taiwan’s highest value assets include six AEW platforms, a large ultra-high frequency (UHF) phased array early warning radar, and radars forward deployed on offshore islands. 

&gt; * The ROCAF operates one of the most advanced air surveillance systems in the world. Barring the Himalayas, Taiwan has the highest elevations in the Indo-Pacific region: more than 156 mountain peaks surpass 3,000 meters (10,000 feet). Early warning radar installations are maintained on selected peaks. 

&gt; * With a service ceiling of more than 10,000 meters, Taiwan’s AEW aircraft should be able to detect targets around Taiwan at ranges greater than 500 kilometers… After over 20 years of operation, however, the E-2K aircraft are reaching the end of their service life 

&gt; * A number of coercive measures are available to the CCP Politburo short of a full-scale amphibious invasion. At the low end of the peace-war continuum, the PLA uses shows of force. The PRC has a long history of leveraging aerospace power as an instrument of coercive persuasion against Taiwan. The PLA could carry out a coercive campaign to attain strategic paralysis and implement a blockade of the skies above Taiwan. A strategic paralysis campaign envisions the physical destruction of Taiwan’s command and control system, strategic warning, and communications nodes through integrated air and missile strikes. In a worst-case scenario, the PLA could attempt an amphibious invasion.56 

&gt; * At the strategic level, early warning enables a national command authority to create a window of time to organize an effective response to existential threats. 

&gt; * For more effective and efficient investments in Taiwan’s national security, the United States and Taiwan would do well to begin establishing roles and missions for critical scenarios across the spectrum of coercion and annihilation.

It depends if you take into consideration civilian casualties and overall regional stability in your equation.
The military junta with the Wagner group have managed to wipe a few villages off maps and have already commited human rights violations that are attracting inquisition by the international community. The french hadn't left the country that the regime already started digging open ditches to throw in civilian corpses.

The French military contingent did stop the country from falling to the terrorists in 2013, and has been a stabilizing force for the somewhat democratic leaning government. Now that there is a junta in power, there is obviously less incentive to uphold western standards of military engagement, so in that regard, the Wagner group can certainly flex its muscles unhindered.

But it should come to no surprise that juntas and PMC aren't known for their stabilizing factors, and the situation is certainly developing into a prolongated conflict between the different factions in Mali.

So reading the article, and the above in particular, I can't help but think back to the PMC group Executive Outcomes, and their success in Angola and Sierra Leone. EO defeats UNITA in Angola and RUF, but then the African governments terminated their contracts because of US and UN pressure.

Their success spits in the face of the notion that UN peacekeeping ""works"", and obviously the UN doesn't want others to know they are ineffective. Same thing with Wagner, if Wagner with a couple hundred dudes training locals and some old equipment can be a lot more successful than the entire French and European military contingent in Africa, that says more about French ""peacekeeping"" than Wagner's success.

That goes back to the price.

Why can't they just be..... mercenaries being mercenaries? The govt pays them to do things that give the govt a sense of 'distance' and lessen their accountability. They're perfect for the needs of a lot of african states.

Let's take one example of actively seeking a subversive interpretation:

&gt; One possible motivation would be to destabilize the European Union by stimulating migration from West Africa, or at least sabotaging European efforts to prevent further migration by stabilizing the Sahel.

If their goal was to create a migrant crisis then they would have supported rebels in the syrian civil war, or completely destroyed Libya - A country that has historically provided employment and opportunities to migrants from across Africa... stopping them from needing to go further afield.

Alas it was US OURSELVES that did both of those things. If this were their goal then they're doing a piss poor job of it. They'd be better off just sitting back and letting us do our own thing.

Unless France's presence contributed to the instability in the Sahel region, so removing the French presence and adding a much smaller Russian presence could stabilise the region by the mere fact of removing the accidental oil that is fueling the fire. 

Why is the assumption that French presence is actually helping the situation and not exacerbating it? 

Insecurity and instability spread the longer France was there, going from a locally popular intervention by France in a francophone region by the local governments asking for help to a long drag of increased violence and attacks in the region. There are complex sociological and local dynamics at play in the region, and France's treatment of it just as terrorism while holding back local authorities from political negotiations with such jihadists groups, is probably counterproductive.

Putting more drug cops on the beat and you can arrest your way out of a war on drugs is the logic that this author follows. This is a simple securitisation logic where more troops at lower to nil cost is always better than less troops at higher cost to counter instability. But what if the troops themselves add to the instability, then you flip the logic on its head.

Wagner provides the basic level of security and an illusion a security partner while pocketing the money so the local junta can solve the instability by focusing on the political negotiation track using anti-French sentiment as political cover while remaining in power to kick the aggravating factor known as the French military mission, everyone wins except for the French.",b82319379b21617045c289b031c589e1f85609c7,True,False,,,,,0,1653721470,,0,{},iaadxs7,False,t3_uzblvk,False,True,t1_ia9b847,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uzblvk/russia_in_the_sahel_towards_a_worsening_of/iaadxs7/,1653721483,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653692670.0,

You can't seriously compare three US allies deliberately built up by the US to counter Soviet / Chinese Communism and a city-state to a country of 1.4 billion people. China was - and still is - the target of multiple US technology embargoes and sanctions, where as Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan benefitted immensely from US military and technological aid. For large stretches of Japan's recent history, they didn't even need a defense budget because they were entirely protected by the US.

By contrast, as recent as fifty years ago, the PRC and the US were fighting in the jungles of Vietnam. All the way up until Nixon's visit, the US was attempting to undermine China at every turn, and even after, it didn't treat China anything like a partner until Clinton, and stopped treating China like a partner just fifteen years later.

I mean, I am no expert in the history of Soviet colonialism in Africa, but have a general knowledge that at least since the 1920's the Soviets had been cultivating influence in  third world nations  that were ignored and scored by most of the west preaching communism as a means to overthrow the chains of western colonialism and revolution 'from the bottom up'.

Not that I am necessarily lambasting communism, but I think the Soviet's were appallingly dishonest actors with zero altruism whose real intent was to exploit those they were claiming to 'save'.

[],False,,EtadanikM,,,[],,,,text,t2_105wcs,False,False,"Chinese media tends to play down the role the West played in the development of China, so it is entirely plausible that the Chinese public is convinced that they were singularly responsible for their own success. Especially in relation to competing countries like India, Brazil, and Mexico, which from the Chinese perspective were given similar opportunities but did not work hard or smart enough to succeed. It is much easier to sell humans narratives that are simultaneously simple - ""hard work leads to success"" - and self-serving - ""*our* hard work led to *our* success"" than narratives that are complex and external - ""our success was enabled by the system.""

Yet, I would argue the Chinese *were* happy about the world order in the decade between 2000 to 2010. And why not? That was the period during which the West was least antagonistic towards China, most appeasing towards China, and when everything seemed to be going great. Despite Taiwan's defiance, most Chinese then believed that it was just a matter of time before Taiwan would peacefully reunify; and many also believed that, as their country got richer, it would inevitably become more progressive. Not in the Western sense, necessarily, but in the Chinese sense of a soft, meritocratic authoritarianism most compatible with East Asian cultural psychology. Singapore was often on the lips of Chinese folks, back then, when they imagined a future China. It's in this context that statements like Jackie Chan's ""Chinese people need to be controlled"" were made.

The anger, the rising nationalism, the thirst for ""justice"" against the West, I'd say those came mostly in the last decade, and is due to a combination of factors: from the material deterioration of the global political and economic environment for China - which the Chinese blame on the West, probably fairly since Trump; to the shift in Chinese media and social media propaganda towards nationalism, which was encouraged under Xi; to the very real set backs suffered by the PRC as it sought to exert its influence and upgrade its industry, for which the state of the world order is definitely relevant.

Funny enough, the best way to think about the last of these is probably the concept of the ""bamboo ceiling"" - back when China was just a low cost, manufacturing center, it didn't step on any powerful toes, and so the ""world"" allowed them to do as they wanted. But as China reached up and into the first world pie, it got more push back. Whether a coincidence or a deliberate policy - or both - it just so happens that it's around this time that US-China relations began to become antagonistic. So from their perspective, it sure looks like the Western led world order is trying to contain them, which then naturally leads to the conclusion that the present world order isn't fair, is hostile to China, and must be overthrown.

So when you ask the question, why aren't the Chinese happy about the current world order? The answer is quite simply - *which* current world order? The one before they started getting actively contained by the West, or the one after? Again, I'd say the Chinese were quite happy in the summer days of Chimerica, when the US treated China with kid's gloves. But today, when the US is rallying its allies against China and treating China as its greatest enemy? Why would the Chinese be happy with this world order?",3edf2ca59698c479916863dab5e79d17c1dabc8f,True,False,,,,,0,1653719687,,0,{},iaabufj,False,t3_uyl45a,False,False,t1_ia6i0w2,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uyl45a/military_competition_with_china_harder_than_the/iaabufj/,1653719698,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653690887.0,

[],False,,robothistorian,,,[],,,,text,t2_2inubrvw,False,False,"&gt;Revelatory of what? Your whole post is filled with very suggestive phrasing and rhetorical questions

I apologize if my post seemed to you to be ""filled with very suggestive phrasing and elrhetorical questions"". However, I will address the more substantive question you posed - ""Revelatory of what?"" - with one example.

The article makes some assertions, which appear to stand on some tacit premises. Now, whether or not those premises were/are known to the author, whether they are deliberately employed the author albeit in a tacit manner, I am not sure. But the fact remains that they can be read into the article. Let me give you one example. The author asserts that (1) one possible reason for the Russians to be engaged in Mali (and the wider Sahel region) is to stir up enough trouble to compel a refugee/migrant influx into the EU, which would be destabilizing to the EU. And (2) that France (and it's Western partners) are engaging or want to engage with Mali and the wider Sahel region to forestall such a state of affairs. Leaving aside whether this is true or not (for there is no way to actually determine this), this line of thinking is very similar to that which underwrites, for example, [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Camp_of_the_Saints), which is considered to be a racist tract.

As for the question that you posed:

* Is it a better idea for Mali to partner with the West or Russia? Why? Firstly, it is for the Malians to determine who to partner with. Secondly, often countries seek to partner with those that - at least at the outset - set very little or no conditions. The PRC is well known for following this model, particularly in its sales of arms and in its foreign infrastructure development projects. Of course, the examples of Sri Lanka, among others, should prove to be a note of caution to countries, but the fact remains that the West is well-known for laying down political and economic conditions (one just had to look at the conditions that the IMF has just put on Pakistan for giving it loans). That said, France is one of those Western countries that does not put as many conditions as other Western countries do (especially the US), which is also one reason why India sources some of it's weapons from France.

* What does the west expect in exchange for security assistance? The author addresses this question directly. First, to forestall the potential movement of migrants/refugees into the EU, which will destabilize the latter. Second, to establish a sphere of influence in an area and in a continent where the PRC is reputed to be making serious inroads. Third, for economic benefits. To assume that France (and it's Western partners) want to engage with Mali and the Sahel region in general out of purely altruistic purposes would be naive.

* Why is there anti-French sentiment? Well, at least one reason is that this region (especially Mali) was a part of the French colony and the French colonial experience would like not agve been very good. While the French colonial exercise ended in 1960, it is also likely that the experience has not been forgotten - it usually isn't in post-colonial countries given the magnitude of ill -practices engaged in by the colonizing power (examples involving the French that stand testimony to this is Vietnam, Algeria). It could also be the case that the French are meddling into Malian affairs to such an extent that it is provoking an anti-French reaction. Notice the author also mentions the case of Burkina Faso. But the author attributes this to Russian machinations and not to anything that the French may have done or are doing.

* Has no one ever attempted to weaponize migration? If not, why? This is, by far, the point in the article that was interesting to me and it's something that I think is worth spending some time researching (speaking for myself). While I have no references for this, but I think Stalin did use the movement of populations for political ends. I think the same.has happened in India (but to a comparably lesser extent). These were.sone to rebalance the ethnic distribution in specific territories for very specific reasons. I am not sure if this was done in Europe but I suspect (worlirhout any evidence) that it did happen.",eef6a4ea2271733d18c043cb98f933fab699e4ed,True,False,,,,,0,1653717936,,0,{},iaa9p4f,False,t3_uzblvk,False,True,t1_iaa4txo,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uzblvk/russia_in_the_sahel_towards_a_worsening_of/iaa9p4f/,1653717953,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653689136.0,

*Germany’s pacifist universities pose obstacle to militarisation of EU R&amp;D.*

https://sciencebusiness.net/news/germanys-pacifist-universities-pose-obstacle-militarisation-eu-rd

Yet in Germany’s pacifist-leaning universities, there is no sign of a similar Zeitenwende just yet.

That’s a strange phrasing. Revelatory of what? Your whole post is filled with very suggestive phrasing and rhetorical questions:

&gt; Yet, such sentiments cannot be stoked without at least a grain of truth. The question then stands: what accounts for this anti-French sentiment?

&gt; Weaponizing migrants is an *interesting concept* and the author *attempts to draw* parallels


Let’s workship this a bit. I’m not an expert so I would be interested in the answers to some of the questions you posed. 

1. Is it a better idea for Mali to partner with the West or Russia? Why?
2. What does the west expect in exchange for security assistance?
3. Why is there anti-French sentiment?
4. Has no one ever attempted to weaponize migration? If not, why?

We're seeing the international but mainly Western reactions to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, including sanctions, Russian banks kicked from SWIFT, and mass boycotts of Russia/Belarus by companies/orgs. Do you think China can expect the same reactions if they went to war over Taiwan, and what would that look like not just for China but also for the rest of the world? Or do you think that China may be too big and too intertwined in the global economy to, for example, kick from SWIFT?

Not OP, but I don't see China getting the same reaction as Russia.

For one, China IS way bigger than Russia on the world economic stage. Think of Russia and what products are made in Russia/Russian businesses and what you can go down to the store and buy.

Vodka, maybe?

Now think of Chinese products, goods, manufacturers, brands, etc. 

That's a whole different beast. 

A lot of Western brands are even owned by Chinese firms now - Volvo, for instance. Think that might cause Sweden to think twice about suddenly jump starting sanctions?

Next thing is that China has way more inroads with Africa, South America, and the rest of Asia than even Russia - and even Middle Eastern allies of the US/West have resisted sanctioning Russia. Are they going to sanction a nation that has potential influence with their rivals (Iran) and is also increasingly their #1 customer?

To say nothing about the fact that China has consistently portrayed itself as the victim of Western imperialism. Indeed, China can claim that they have suffered from the ailments of Western imperialism - and Taiwan is used as a symbol of the US dividing China up - and that line of thought appeals to a lot of places like the aforementioned Asia, Africa, and Central/South America where they themselves know what the effects of Western imperialism are.

[],False,,robothistorian,,,[],,,,text,t2_2inubrvw,False,False,"Interesting article. Thanks for sharing.

I found the section titled ""Why Partnering With the Russians Is Bad for Mali"" most interesting. Let me explain why.

First, the author argues that

&gt;While there is, in theory, nothing wrong with enlisting the support of another provider of security assistance,  turning to Russia comes at the cost of weakening the country’s bilateral relations with France and its other Western partners (notably the United States and the many members of the European Union who contribute to French military operations, European Union training missions and the United Nations mission in Mali, MINUSMA).

This assertion carries with the implicit assumption that partnering with ""France and it's other Western partners"" is a better option than that of partnering with the Russians. The author justifies this, in part, by asserting that 

&gt;This might be an acceptable price to pay (setting aside the fact that French, European and UN operations are free, while Mali pays the Russians) if Russian aid equaled or exceeded the combined French and European efforts in effectiveness or simply offset cuts that France and its allies might make in the weeks and months ahead.

The point is an interesting one. Are we to believe that France (and it's Western partners) will help Mali and be active in the larger Sahel region due to altruism? That's a difficult argument to accept. The question then arises: what will France (and it's Western partners) expect as a ""return on investment""?

This is also related to another point that the author makes. He acknowledges that

&gt;the wave of anti-French sentiment is putting significant pressure on the governments of Burkina Faso and Niger, both of which work closely with the French military.

The author attribute this to Russian disinformation actions and it may, in part, very well be the case. As large extra-region powers jockey for positions, they sell to undermine each other's role and standing. Yet, such sentiments cannot be stoked without at least a grain of truth. The question then stands: what accounts for this anti-French sentiment?

What is even more striking (and intriguing) is the author's assertion (or, to be generous, speculation) regarding Russia's motives.

&gt;However, Russia may have other motives. One possible motivation would be to destabilize the European Union by stimulating migration from West Africa, or at least sabotaging European efforts to prevent further migration by stabilizing the Sahel.

Weaponizing migrants is an interesting concept and the author attempts to draw parallels with what happened in Syria. But economic and political reasons have long been reasons for migration from the Sahel into Europe. The author's contention is that France (and it's Western partners) engagement with the region at large is to forestall such migrations by quelling at he very least political unrest and by establishing resilient economies. This is contestable. Moreover, this argument of atrempting to weaponize migrants is a novel take (and modification) of the [Yellow Peril](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20020056) discourse (albeit modified for the African continent).

In sum, this article is interesting for not simply what it describes (particularly the activities of the Wagner Group), but also for what it implies.

When this is contrasted with the extremely negative view many westerners (including myself before the last 4 or 5 years embarrassingly) hold towards this government

I'm sorry, but what you should really be embarrassed about, is writing this drivel.

(1) The CCP has done nothing special. Their achievement was already pioneered and surpassed by the post-WW2 governments in Japan, Korea (South, obviously), Taiwan, and Singapore. China's Communist government is not a trailblazing philosopher-king regime, but just another government that has managed to copy the East Asian field manual for success, and is now nearing the end of its toolkit.

I will not deny that the great majority of the Chinese people hold this positive view of the CCP that you describe, but obviously much of that comes from the self-aggrandizing BS that the CCP pumps into the Chinese psyche, through overt and subtle propaganda and through a carefully managed, massive echo chamber that is the Chinese public discourse. Which leads me to...

(2) If you are a Westerner, you are better off just mindlessly hating the CCP, like you did before. You will be nearer the truth that way.

Westerners who attempt at a more ""nuanced"" view of their adversaries never actually get it right, and often run dangerously close to ""going native"". Especially Britons and Americans - your societies have been (generally) free and prosperous for too long, and you can never understand the warped worldview that an unfree society can produce. Ever heard of the term ""tilted soccer field""? That's what politics is like in most non-Western countries. Ever subtle bias in media, judiciary, institutions, all rooting for one specific team. Now imagine China; that's not a tilted field, the opposition is outright trying to score goals against a goalpost atop a 100m-tall cliff. 

And here you are, thinking that a generally positive view of the CCP held by the Chinese is anything other than a carefully manicured public consensus, largely generated and imposed by the top, ""manufactured consent"" style. 

PS. You started hating the CCP less in the last 5\~6 years?

[],False,,FoxThreeForDale,,,[],,,,text,t2_isg0upma,False,False,"&gt; Nah, it's pretty much on the money. The difference is, the last 10-15 years haven't seen the most spectacular of growth in cutting edge semiconductors compared to the 10-15 years preceeding lol. For 15 years, 2007 would put us at like, 30nm? 

2006 was Intel Core 2, which was when we were at 65nm. 2008 was Nehalem, which was at 45nm

&gt;For 10, we're practically still at 14nm lol - given that Intel (as you said) adopted the process in 2014. Given that the overwhelming majority of sub-14nm chips are produced by TSMC (sure technically intel's ireland fab and samsung's operations produce down to like 5nm or something, but they're a pretty insignificant part of that ""ultra fine process"" market compared to TSMC, who absolutely dominates it), it would make it pretty tough to find semiconductors in supply under 14 to 20nm.

TSMC dominates it, but not as much as you think. Samsung has been under 14 nm for a while (the RTX 3000 series is on 8nm, for instance) and Intel is on Intel 7 now with Alder Lake. 

Corporate mismanagement can set a lot of companies behind (like Boeing), but there are plenty of stories of turnarounds (like Apple) that Intel can follow, and Pat Gelsinger seems to be doing a great job so far

&gt;We'd certainly compress those 10-15 years of development to perhaps 4-5 years, maybe less if extraordinary financial/governmental/etc. backing were provided, but it would still have an enormous impact for those years, and would make much of our state of the art computing tech un-procurable (especially consequential for the AI/ML, physics, and other similar sectors that rely on enormous amounts of compute power for their research

The big thing is that even if TSMC and Samsung were destroyed, a lot of that state of the art stuff would then get sent to places like Intel. Part of Intel's turnaround strategy right now is to turn its foundries into being usable by non Intel customers - and the government trying to help boost Intel recently is coming with strings attached to make sure critical technology can be manufactured by them if needed

A lot of the cutting edge *consumer* stuff? Sure, a lot of it might be impacted by TSMC and Samsung, but a lot of that stuff is consumer electronics based. Apple's M1 series, for instance, is on TSMC 5nm. Would losing great chips for your Macbook or iPad or iPhone be disruptive to the average person? Sure, but that's also why the ""China will take Taiwan for TSMC"" thing is now in the public pop-mil-sci awareness 

The other key here is that China relies heavily on a lot of those chips as well. Destroying them would also set their AI/ML and datacenter farms back too

Like I said, as a whole, it's all recent pop-mil-sci shit. Heck, people don't even understand that until relatively recently, a good contingent of people on Taiwan were pro-reunification as well - and a lot of them weren't even descendants of Mainlanders",4cc1eb6e823b4da86e0ad8e5f2b8652e29ed4df0,True,False,,,,,0,1653702810,,0,{},ia9l50w,False,t3_uyl45a,False,True,t1_ia687q8,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uyl45a/military_competition_with_china_harder_than_the/ia9l50w/,1653702822,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653674010.0,

*How the U.S. Has Struggled to Stop the Growth of a Shadowy Russian Private Army*

Vladimir Putin has increasingly relied on the Wagner Group, a private and unaccountable army with a history of human rights violations, to pursue Russia’s foreign policy objectives across the globe.

https://www.propublica.org/article/wagner-group-russia-putin-private-army

Quotes:

&gt; * In Syria, Wagner fighters were filmed gleefully beating a Syrian army deserter with a sledgehammer before cutting off his head. In the Central African Republic, United Nations investigators received reports that the mercenaries raped, tortured and murdered civilians. In Libya, Wagner allegedly booby-trapped civilian homes with explosives attached to toilet seats and teddy bears. Last month, German intelligence officials linked Wagner mercenaries to indiscriminate killings in Ukraine.

&gt; * The Kremlin officially denies any connection with the activities of Russian mercenaries abroad, and much about Wagner’s structure and leadership remains unclear. But experts say that Wagner’s top officers have participated in meetings between foreign leaders and top Russian officials. They also say the Russian air force has transported Wagner fighters to launch the group’s international missions.

&gt; * Wagner has spread around the world, particularly in Africa, because it presents an enticing package to leaders of embattled nations, experts said. It offers to quash terrorism and rebel threats with brutal military crackdowns, while rallying public support for their government clients through disinformation campaigns.

&gt; * U.S. officials said they have felt underequipped in trying to curtail the mercenaries’ incursions, in part because American diplomacy in Africa has been gradually stripped of resources over the past three decades.

&gt; * “You either have concrete programs of assistance, or you have personal relationships and diplomatic capital built up over the years that you can call upon,” Pham said. “Many American officials, often of middling rank, are often dispatched with neither.”

&gt; * American officials say Wagner operates through a web of shell companies controlled by the Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, a food industry magnate with close ties to Putin, sardonically referred to as “Putin’s Chef.”

&gt; * Experts say the Wagner Group appears to be paid in proceeds from natural resources like oil, gold and diamonds in countries where they are fighting. 

&gt; * “Russia has opened up military operations in two continents, for the first time since the 1980s,” said Sean McFate, a professor at the National Defense University. “The tip of the spear is the Wagner Group.”

&gt; * Joseph Siegle, director of research at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies, said Russian military successes in the Syrian conflict represented an “inflection point for Russia.” “They saw how quickly they could gain influence in a region where they’d had relatively little influence,” Siegle said.

&gt; * Economically, Russia pales in comparison to superpowers like China and the United States. But in the Wagner group, officials said, Russia has found a cheap and novel foreign policy tool that America has yet to find a way to address. Client governments appear to absorb most of the cost.

I learned a few things from this article. The author made mention of a possible information war in Africa by Russia, and that the destabilization of Africa might actually be part of Russia's plan as it hurts Europe. I did not think of this being part of Russia's goal for being in Africa before, but it does make sense. 

The fact that Wagner must be paid ($10 million a month was mentioned) while the European assistance is free, confused me as to the motivations of the leaders of these African countries. However it makes sense if you see that the leaders do not actually care about the state expenditures, and the Russians never ask nagging questions for reform, anti-corruption, and free elections. So there is a logic to it that I had not considered before. 

---------------------

&gt; * It is now undeniable that Russia has become an influential and dangerous actor in the Sahel, which may be deliberately exacerbating the region’s problems as Sahelian countries struggle to cope with growing political and security crises.

&gt; * What the Russians have done is cleverly exploit French failures, the failures of French-backed regimes, and anti-French sentiment already present in the Sahel.

&gt; * Russia’s main line of action in the Sahel has been influence operations exploiting social media. Russia has also used the Wagner Group as a decoy and tool, while deploying an older form of influence in the form of advisors with direct access to key leaders.

&gt; * Russian information operations in the Sahel have been well documented by several French and American studies. They involve the use of Facebook and WhatsApp, as well as Russian state media outlets such as Russia Today and Sputnik, to generate and distribute content. The content produced tends to reinforce key discourses that denigrate France and the West in general, as well as French-backed regimes, while promoting certain forms of populist politics.

&gt; * Anti-French sentiment combined with traditional pan-Africanist and anti-imperialist themes constitutes a powerful ideology. In the classical Marxist sense of the word, this refers to a belief system that aims not only to explain why things are going wrong, but also to justify existing power structures. In this case, it enables one to reject blaming oneself or one’s own governments. In short, everything that happens is not the fault of Mali, its authorities, or its elites.

&gt; * There is circumstantial evidence of another possible aspect of Russian influence operations. Wagner’s arrival in Mali in late December was accompanied by a change in the substance and tone of the Malian regime’s messages and diplomacy.

&gt; * …when combined with what appears to be a concerted propaganda effort by the Malian armed forces to encourage the belief that they have accomplished far more in recent operations than they did prior to the 2020 coup, one can see the outlines of a comprehensive strategic communications plan. Of course, the Malians themselves are capable of devising such a plan, but there is no denying that such things are a Russian specialty and, more specifically, a specialty of Yevgeny Prigozhin’s empire.

&gt; * Wagner’s presence in Mali, unlike in the Central African Republic, remains shrouded in ambiguity. The government still insists that Wagner is not in the country, while paradoxically promoting the idea that Russian assistance is already making a significant difference on the battlefield. 

&gt; * Wagner arrived in Mali at the end of December 2021. According to several sources, their strength on the ground is said to be around a thousand. 

&gt; * The available evidence indicates that Mali is paying in cash out of its own funds.

&gt; * This might be an acceptable price to pay (setting aside the fact that French, European and UN operations are free, while Mali pays the Russians) if Russian aid equaled or exceeded the combined French and European efforts in effectiveness or simply offset cuts that France and its allies might make in the weeks and months ahead. This, however, is a fantasy.

&gt; * Simply put, it is a matter of mathematics: It is impossible for a few hundred Russian mercenaries to do a better job than several thousand French and European soldiers supported by French military aircraft and drones.

&gt; * The belief that somehow Russian aid will make a significant difference absolves the junta from providing real solutions to the country’s problems.

&gt; * The Malian junta has clearly found in its anti-French rhetoric and defiant posture a very simple way to secure popular legitimacy at the expense of developing effective policies to secure the country and defeat jihadism.

&gt; * One possible motivation would be to destabilize the European Union by stimulating migration from West Africa, or at least sabotaging European efforts to prevent further migration by stabilizing the Sahel. This is, after all, one of the main reasons why Europeans are present in the Sahel, and we have already seen evidence in Syria of Russia’s willingness to instrumentalize migrants against Europe. 

&gt; * Another possible motive would be to undermine France’s efforts to promote a unified European defence and security policy, motivated by Russia’s hostility to the European Union. France has clearly wanted to Europeanize the conflict in the Sahel, in part to ease the burden on its military. However, France also has used the conflict as an opportunity to pursue its goal of promoting a European security policy in line with French interests. In doing so, Russian actions in Mali are straining the coalition that France has put in place and threaten to derail the project.

**Key Takeaways**  
  
Russian forces began direct assaults on built-up areas of Severodonetsk without having fully encircled the city and will likely struggle to take ground in the city itself.  
Russian forces in Lyman appear to be dividing their efforts—attacking both southwest to support stalled forces in Izyum and southeast to advance on Siversk; they will likely struggle to accomplish either objective in the coming days.  
Russian forces in Popasna seek to advance north to support the encirclement of Severodonestk rather than advancing west toward Bakhmut.  
Positions northeast of Kharkiv City remain largely static, with no major attacks by either Russian or Ukrainian forces.  
Russian forces continue to fortify their defensive positions along the southern axis and advance efforts to integrate the Kherson region into Russian economic and political structures.

**Immediate items to watch**  
  
Russian forces are likely reinforcing their grouping north of Kharkiv City to prevent further advances of the Ukrainian counteroffensive toward the Russian border. Russian forces may commit elements of the 1st Tank Army to northern Kharkiv in the near future.   
Russian forces are unlikely to advance rapidly in direct assaults against Severodonetsk, but supporting operations to fully encircle the town will likely continue to secure incremental gains.  
Occupation forces in Mariupol will continue to strengthen administrative control of the city but are likely unsure of what the ultimate annexation policy will be.  
Russian forces are likely preparing for Ukrainian counteroffensives and settling in for protracted operations in southern Ukraine.",480a802bc1f171d942df8c8f43d98f64bb01aafa,True,False,,,,,0,1653696710,,0,{},ia99mf0,False,t3_uywnui,False,True,t3_uywnui,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uywnui/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_27_2022/ia99mf0/,1653696722,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653667910.0,
