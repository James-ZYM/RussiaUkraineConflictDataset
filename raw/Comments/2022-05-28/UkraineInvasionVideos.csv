Their launch tube can be mounted on/in both ships, [heavy transport trucks](https://images.app.goo.gl/Z1sxzaSr748wZcjy7) and coastal missile batteries.

There are a lot of minor details between updates of the [Block II harpoon and Next gen Harpoon](https://www.naval-technology.com/projects/harpoon-block-ii-anti-ship-missile/), so depending on variant it may also have a data-link for mid-flight targeting data updates, a higher altitude flight profile for over land/littoral combat and a number of other updates to improve hit probability.

It has been called the sharpest “spear” of Cold War naval missile technology which is demonstrated by its wide adoption and continued use by the more than a half dozen navies using them today and is still one of the best anti-ship missiles in current production, but it’s time is likely coming to a close as [newer more advanced missile systems ](https://breakingdefense.com/2022/04/navys-next-gen-ship-killing-missile-will-be-a-hypersonic-weapon-dubbed-halo/amp/)become available.

And he described rapes carried out by drunken russian soldiers. The nazis moved into the village shortly after, and had to deal with the drunken russians and dead civilians. 

I always took that part as fiction, but apperently I was wrong. 

If there were a few rapes, it could be written on the page of bad apples… but this is systematic. So it has to be accepted from higher-ups. And they need to be held accountable.

The day after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, a Russian lawmaker who also happens to be the grandson of one of the most famous diplomats of the 20th century gave a speech in parliament.  
In his speech, Vyacheslav Nikonov quoted his grandfather, Vyacheslav Molotov, who negotiated the Molotov-Ribbentrop deal that carved up Poland and much of Eastern Europe -- and made a prediction.  
“The enemy will be defeated and victory will be ours. And I have no doubts about this,” he said.

In a March 11 video conference with President Vladimir Putin, Russia’s defense minister argued against that conclusion.  
  
""Vladimir Vladimirovich, everything is going to plan,"" said Sergei Shoigu, who is one of Putin’s closest confidants. ""We report this to you every day this week.""
