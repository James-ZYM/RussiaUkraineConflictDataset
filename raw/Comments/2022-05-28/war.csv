But they still need to respect orders from higher ups. And the higher ups won't allow total obliteration - not because they wouldn't want to - the only thing that keeps them from doing things like that are fear of further sanctions and retaliation from NATO if they would cross that line too much. Your narrative is a loser russian narrative or a narrative of someone really naive - russians see how much they fucked up with this war - they are being destroyed in Ukraine and their position in the world has been destroyed  and they are on the verge of bankruptcy - that's why they won't allow it. You think their soldiers will face any punishment for rape and murder they commited when they return home? Open your eyes. Most russian people are brainwashed and uneducated. Violence, rape, thievery, getting drunk and illusion of grandeur are all they understand. This is their mentality. Do you even know the history of russia? This is more of the same thing they did all over again. This is in their blood because that's what they're taught from the day they are born.

How did you measure the lack of education of Russian soldiers?The Butch massacre is not ""total obliteration""?If so, then why does the Russian command not pay attention to this and allows soldiers to kill people, but at the same time helps prisoners in Azovstal (and they are actually Nazis)?Are you absolutely sure that the soldiers who carried out the massacre in Bucha were not punished?In your opinion, every Russian person eats 3 Ukrainian children for breakfast? :)It really is.

It would be a slaughter.

Bro, I see you know absolutely the whole situation at the front, you are an expert.Only my brother recently went on vacation, I asked him about the situation at the front and other things (he is a lieutenant), the Ukrainian army sucks in a volley (losses are several times more), almost 2 thousand prisoners were captured in Azov alone.The Russian army is quite effective, but moving around cities takes a very long time (every building needs to be cleaned).The Ukrainian army is insanely poor, with outdated equipment.If you judge the situation at the front by CNN news, etc., then I feel sorry for you.I advise you to find independent telegram channels, not pro-Ukrainian or pro-Russian, although they are hard to find.

Now we WILL 100% i am calling send over HIMARS if not just light I would say both med and long-range When Ukrain can hit Russia from 175 MILES AWAY it is going to change everything. They can keep Russia at bay for 2 months DRASTICALLY reducing any troops being in harm's way.

Ukraine will have a Hard line within which it can hold 15-20 miles no man's land advantage over Russia to counterattack and push them back. People forget Poland wanted to send Jets and other countries wanted to send more things the USA was not down with then.
