If you digg deeper we end up discussing why the Poles asked the Teutonic Order to get rid of the old Prussians and to allow them to take all Land they conquer north of Poland....

FFS who cares what Kohl was up to? Like everyone else he was entitled have his opinion. But it is not upon the Chancellor to make such decisions.

&gt; Poland is fed up with modernizing your crappy 2A4 tanks already, which is why they bought 250 Abrams tanks to replace their t-72 fleet, last year.

Because they are fed up is why they asked for more Leopards via the ring swap...?

&gt; Poland never had a surplus of tanks. Just enough to protect the eastern NATO flank 

The Eastern Nato flank until 1990 ran through the middle of Germany was mined and booby trapped German people actually died there trying to flee the GDR (USSR). West-Germany would have fought off the Warsaw Pact including GDR and Poland on German Turf so don't lecture us about the dangers of being neighbour to the Russian Army.

&gt; Yeah, like Czechs that agreed to get 15 2A4 tanks within six months of signing the contract, pay Germany for upgrading them later on and to buy 50 2A7s in the future. A normal business deal Czechs could get even without sending their tanks to Ukraine, but if they're willing to replace their T72 fleet anyway, this makes sense.

If you say so they seem to have agreed to the deal so i bet the offer was good enough.",0fc52e4125c1cd9e0dafce4e9e7e7a1e1036cb92,True,False,,,,,0,1653782355,,0,{},iaddf5i,False,t3_uzto7z,False,False,t1_iad6p4h,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uzto7z/despite_promises_germany_has_delivered_hardly_any/iaddf5i/,1653782372,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653753555.0,

&gt; KYIV, May 28 - Ukrainian forces may have to retreat from their last pocket in the Luhansk region to avoid being captured, a Ukrainian official said, as Russian troops press an advance in the east that has shifted the momentum of the three-month-old war.

&gt; Luhansk&amp;#039;s governor, Serhiy Gaidai, said Russian troops had entered Sievierodonetsk, the largest Donbas city still held by Ukraine, after trying to trap Ukrainian forces there for days, though adding that Russian forces would not be able to capture the Luhansk region &amp;quot;As analysts have predicted&amp;quot;.

&gt; STRUGGLING TO LEAVEIn the Kherson region in the south, Russian forces were fortifying defences and shelling Ukraine-controlled areas, the region&amp;#039;s Ukrainian governor told media.

&gt; Ukraine is in a race against time to save the eastern Donbas region as relentless Russian artillery and air strikes threaten to turn the tide of the war, and support for Kyiv&amp;#039;s continued defiance among some west European allies appears to be slipping.

&gt; Despite the delay, he insisted it was &amp;quot;Not too late&amp;quot; to send new weapons to Ukraine.

&gt; &amp;quot;Having supported Ukraine and encouraged them to stand up to Russian aggression in the early phase, we&amp;#039;ve now got a real obligation to see it through for the long term,&amp;quot; he said.

Poland is fed up with modernizing your crappy 2A4 tanks already, which is why they bought 250 Abrams tanks to replace their t-72 fleet, last year.

&gt;They had a surplus of tanks

Poland never had a surplus of tanks. Just enough to protect the eastern NATO flank, so that other nations could relax and disarm themselves, investing their money elsewhere.

&gt;same with ring swap deals with Slovenia, Slovakia and Czech

Yeah, like Czechs that agreed to get 15 2A4 tanks within six months of signing the contract, pay Germany for upgrading them later on and to buy 50 2A7s in the future. A normal business deal Czechs could get even without sending their tanks to Ukraine, but if they're willing to replace their T72 fleet anyway, this makes sense.

By the fact that they are in Ukrainian positions and speak Ukarinsky.

&gt;I gave you a link to a blog where a Russian soldier explains how exactly that ""erasing"" is carried out. 

AND? it is the largest conflict since Vietnam, involving tens of thousands of people. One does not cancel out the other.

&gt; Massive, massive loss of lives on the Russian sides. Ukrainians are well-entrenched, and eventually, when their positions are becoming too destroyed, they move back in a controlled manner to new fortified positions, and the cycle of eliminating Russians repeats.

Everything is correct. These positions have been prepared for 8 years, they have several lines of defense. When one position is destroyed, those who survived retreat. Then, when the last line of defense is destroyed, they simply flee and die in an open field from artillery. These are the realities of war.

&gt;Russia has a huge problem with the Ukrainian trenches, because Russia ran out of any more or less high-tech shells and bombs. They don't use airburst shells for example

Lol. I have been hearing this tale since the first days of the war. But cruise missiles are still flying, and every day almost the entire territory of Ukarina is sounded by air raid alerts.  
Ukraine has at its disposal neutered M-777s without a digital fire control system. But even this number is negligible. Adviser to the President of Ukraine Arestovich directly speaks about this.

&gt;You realize that Google Translate exists, right? Haven't I just given you a link to a Russian blog post?

This is not enough. You must be able to understand the language when people are speaking. If you understand the language, I will send you links to interviews with Ukrainian military analysts.

&gt;Yep. Ukraine still has 5 volunteers per open position, and denies people with no military experience. 

No, this is a lie. And this is confirmed by Ukrainian prisoners of war whose account goes to several thousand.

&gt;Most of the Russian military involved in fighting Ukraine is in Russia. It has a total of 1 million on active duty. Which is a bit more than 700000, right?

AND? This does not change the fact that Ukraine is throwing her untrained soldiers en masse into the crucible of war. At the same time, there is no mobilization of even reservists in Russia.

&gt;Full, 100% mobilization of every male, no matter the health, in DNR/LNR, which is hundreds of thousands. 

There is indeed mobilization, most of these people are in the third line reserve. It doesn't make much sense to use them in combat, they are not regular military personnel and their value is low. Besides, what hundreds of thousands are you talking about? It's just a blatant lie. There aren't that many people in this region.

&gt;One army has 10x the military budget of the other, a devastating advantage in tanks, planes, artillery etc. How did it happen that it sucked so badly, and the war turned into pretty much a stalemate? 

How did it happen that Vietnam fucked the USA?  
In addition, anyone knows that the offensive requires a ratio of 3v1 (at least) Russia did not even have this, and is still continuing the offensive. This war has just begun, let's wait for its results and after that it will be possible to say the final word.

&gt; And how do you know that 2500 surrendered in Mariupol? I don't recall Ukraine confirming that. Hundreds - sure. 2500? Sounds a bit too much. Russia is probably lying to avoid admitting that just a few hundreds killed thousands of Russians and held a dozen BTGs tied up for months.

Lord, what reasoning child? How do you know the moon isn't made of cheese? Because you've never been there...  
2,500 thousand people surrendered from Azovstal, and yes, this is about a few hundred at the Ilyich plant. Moreover, when Russia found out how many prisoners were on the Azov steel, it turned out that Russia was advancing in the minority. (Last few days)  
If you do not believe these data, wait for the official exchange of prisoners of war or the verdicts of the court.

Visit this telegram channel, which was created so that Ukrainians can identify their relatives. Only on this resource there are about 2600 thousand prisoners of war, each signed with an individual number and photograph.  
Is there something similar from the Ukrainian side? No.  
Since April, they have not captured more than one Russian soldier.

&gt;Where did you get the ""500"" Ukrainian number?

[https://nv.ua/ukraine/events/voyna-rossii-protiv-ukrainy-skolko-rossiyskih-plennyh-v-ukraine-50231101.html](https://nv.ua/ukraine/events/voyna-rossii-protiv-ukrainy-skolko-rossiyskih-plennyh-v-ukraine-50231101.html)

Since April, Ukarina has not shown a single frame of Russian prisoners. And the information about the exchange of prisoners was announced by the Ukrainian side precisely this number. (wrong, not 500, but 600).

&gt;And now they have nothing whatsoever in common.

Yeah, tell it to my relatives from Ukraine or my mother. rzhunimag.  
Every third Russian has a relative in Ukraine, the same goes for Ukrainians.

&gt;If 10k people fight to the end, then this would mean 20000-30000 casualties on the Russian side. 

These are your fantasies. With such losses, Russia would have lost the war long ago. lol.  
In reality, Russia will simply erase Ukarin's positions from the face of the earth with artillery. This is directly stated by the adviser to the President of Ukraine, if you understand Russian, I will give you a link.  
Yes, the destruction of such fortified points takes time.

&gt;Losing them would indeed be really bad.

They're absolutely not a military power, and very much by design and at the request if their neighbours after WW2 and again after 1990, when a lot if kts neighbours (including Poland) were really worried about Germany getting too strong militarily. 


And you're right, they've been a major exporter of weapons for ages, but a) they had a dogma of not sending stuff into an existing crisis (which they often violated, eg when delivering to Israel or Saudi Arabia) and b) they delivered in accordance with regular order processes. You order, you get permission, you get your delivery slots starting about a year or two down the line. Aleo, they didn't really make much for themselves, and what the did make (and buy) tends to be in semi-great condition. To wit: The Bundeswehr is responsible for the operations of the government fleet of airplanes. Which were so unreliable Merkel and Scholz repeatedly missed appointments. They finally started replacing them in 20/21, but it shows you how badly managed and funded everything is.

It started right away preparation for technical inspection of received machines. Cab covers were removed and dismantled engines, pilot seats and then disassembled other components and aggregates, which were directed to renovation or regeneration. During the reviews, in several ex-German planes were found to be serious damage to load-bearing elements. The overall wear of the airframes was estimated to be very high. The planes did flight time within 1300 hours (on average), however theirs the technical condition was assessed by experts by 1000 more hours from the actual state!  
  
MiG-29, bought from the Luftwaffe, became WZL-2 cycle of works, the scope of which has been established after the reviews made by specialists from Bydgoszcz plants and the RSK-MiG corporation and the Military Institute of Technology Aviation. Contrary to appearances, the scope of works performed on these planes it was not just a regular inspection. In its course, microcracks on the nodes were removed fuselage wing suspension, adjusted braking parachute device for the version operated in Poland, fuel tanks were sealed, the elements of the mechanization of the engine inlet diffusers have been strengthened, additional mountings have been used hoses of high-pressure hydraulic pumps, the suspension elements of the box were modernized aggregate drives. As part of the work at all machines were installed and integrated with the existing ones systems (via the TGR-29A interface) the ""self-to-others"" identification system, based on the SC10D2 transponder and the VOR / ILS bearing navigation system, based on ANV-241MMR receiver. The DC-01 coupling digital data converter was designed and manufactured the existing Radiotechnical System of Near Navigation AN / ARN-118 type with TGR-29A interface. Finally the existing TRIMBLE GPS receiver is integrated 2101 I / O with airplane navigation systems and DDT 2101 data repeater was installed in the second cabin of a two-seater plane. Restored to activities unused or partially disassembled the following systems by the Germans: radio engineering the A-323 close navigation system (RSBN) and the 23S optical-electronic aiming system (KOŁS).

&gt;Military Aviation Works No. 2 based in Bydgoszcz have finished the modernisation process of 16 MiG-29 fighters used by the Polish Air Force. The programme has been carried out together with the Israel Aerospace Industries  company, and had a value of PLN 126 million. The aircraft have been fitted with modern avionics, mission computers and NATO-standards-compliant communications suite.  
  
On 4th November Military Aviation Works No. 2 have been a place where a hand-off ceremony regarding the last modernised MiG-29UB took place. The event has been attended by the deputy head of the Armament Inspectorate, Jan Woźniak. Soon the aircraft will join the rest of the modernised fighters, which are at disposal of the 23rd AB in Minsk Mazowiecki. The base is a home for 13 MiG-29A single-seaters and 3 MiG-29UB two-seater jets.     
  
Modernisation which is implemented by the Bydgoszcz-based Military Aviation Works No. 2 has been contracted in August 2011 and it aimed at digitization of the management system, achieving full compatibility with NATO management systems and improvement of the pilot’s work conditions.

*Rashists are preparing to launch new missile strikes on Ukraine, from ships that are about to sink*

*Defense Express* has learned from our own sources that the enemy is launching the Caspian flotilla missile corvettes, with Caliber cruise missiles aboard. 

Specifically, two missile corvettes *Grad Sviyazhsk* and *Velikiy Ustyug* of the 250th Division and can carry up to 16 *Kalibr* missiles, came out of the Caspian Sea between May 23-24, 2022.

Russians currently has 4 *Kalibr* cruise missile carriers in the Caspian Sea: the *Dagestan* patrol ship, 3 corvettes (*Grad Sviyazhsk, Uglich, and Veliky Ustyug*)—a total volley of possibly to 32 missiles.

These Rashists, of RF’s Caspian flotilla, now “insure"" their ""colleagues"" of the Black Sea Fleet.  Presently, there are only two *Kalibr* ships in the Black Sea— frigates *Admiral Essen* and *Admiral Makarov.* (The remaining missile ships are at bases, due to the storm.)

But just four days ago, the UA Intelligence reported that the sailors of the Caspian flotilla were afraid to go out to sea because their Command had stolen the funds intended for spare parts for their ships, and the sailors believed the corvettes were in an emergency-type situation [because ships not sea-worthy.](https://defence-ua.com/army_and_war/rashisti_doplavalis_bojatsja_zapuskati_kalibri_z_avarijnih_korvetiv_u_kaspijskomu_mori-7483.html).

But the outrageous Russian defiance and rejection of war crimes in Bucha remains in full force:

“In a sometimes terse exchange with the BBC's Clive Myrie, the ambassador also denied Russian forces were shelling civilians and said allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha were a ""fabrication"".”

Asked the question, ""Why is Russia conducting this war in this way, committing war crimes?"" 

Mr Kelin replied: ""The mayor of Bucha in his initial statement has confirmed that Russian troops has left, everything is clean and calm, the town in a normal state.

""Nothing is happening, no bodies are on the street. But next, after it has been done - but anyway...""

Myrie then pressed him: ""So this is all made up, Sir? This is all a fabrication? All this evidence is a fabrication?""

""In our view it is a fabrication. It is used just to interrupt negotiations,"" the ambassador replied.

If we wouldn't have sold Poland almost as much Leopards as the Germany Army has for cheap and we didn't offer the ring swap Poland wouldn't give away their T-72 tanks because than they would be needed for their own security.

Same with ring swap deals with Slovenia, Slovakia and Czech. Germany made agreements with them tto deliver their Tanks, AA... to Ukraine and get backfilled by Germany.

&gt; **U.S. Shoots Down Polish Proposal to Get Warplanes to Ukraine Via Germany**
&gt; 
&gt; Poland’s government said it would be willing to transfer its fleet of MiG-29 fighter jets to an American base in Germany, though it wasn’t immediately clear if the U.S. or other NATO allies would offer any support for the proposal.
&gt; 
&gt; The move by Poland would presumably be part of a plan to get the jets into Ukrainian territory eventually. But a top American official called the offer on Tuesday a surprise, and an attempt to carry it out would likely be seen by Russian President Vladimir Putin as an act of aggression....

&gt; 5/25/2022 - 2:39pm Federal government ""baffled"" by Polish criticism of tank swapThe German government has rejected the Polish president's rebuke of the proposed ring swap of tanks. ""The German government is flabbergasted,"" government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said in Berlin. He said the Polish president's criticism was noted, ""but that doesn't make it right. ""The background is a dispute over the German government's proposal that Eastern European EU and NATO partners hand over their Soviet- or Russian-built tanks to Ukraine. In return, they are to receive modernized Leopard 2 tanks from Germany. Hebestreit pointed to negotiations with several Eastern European states. However, he said, there had been no promise to deliver Leopard 2-A7 tanks of the most modern design. The German armed forces also have only a few of this version, and more are in the pipeline. That is why an agreement has been reached with the Czech Republic, for example, to supply modernized Leopard 2 tanks to replace the old Soviet-designed tanks.

I am wondering if some people from the economy are paid to use their influence or something else is going on. Generally I think if politicians in general wanted to help Russia, most of their actions wouldn’t make sense. We are heavily reducing gas and oil imports from Russia. Also why even bother clearing funds and voting weapon exports just to then slow everything down in the process of implementing the decisions? Also why lobbying for sanctions and support on EU level?

&gt; President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine expects &amp;quot;Good news&amp;quot; from Ukraine&amp;#039;s partners regarding the provision of weapons and equipment necessary to defend against Russia as early as next week.

&gt; Every day, we draw closer to the day when our army will overwhelm the occupiers&amp;#039; army technologically and in terms of its attack force.

&gt; Details: Zelenskyy once again urged the world to officially recognise Russia as a terrorist state and a state sponsor of terrorism.

&gt; For one hour each week, imprisoned Russian dissident Alexey Navalny is allowed to send and receive messages with the outside world.

&gt; A thorn deep in Vladimir Putin&amp;#039;s side, Navalny authored the Russian president&amp;#039;s profile in Time Magazine&amp;#039;s recent list of the 100 most influential people, calling him an &amp;quot;An evil madman with an army, nuclear weapons, and membership in the U.N. Security Council&amp;quot; who the world must stop.

&gt; Navalny has issued a call for more resources to break through the propaganda blackout, with a post on his Twitter account last month calling it the &amp;quot;Informational front&amp;quot; in the battle against Putin.

On the one hand they publicly demand decisive actions against Putin, they send significant help to Ukraine, but on the other hand main objective for PiS supposedly is to break up EU from the inside and subjugate it with Russia's support (Kaczynski wants to rule) and in case that it fails, they want to use far-right wing party (Konfederacja) to lead for Polexit. 

I'm not sure what to think about it, because in the past [he exposed](https://www.dw.com/en/the-polish-reporter-who-told-pis-defense-ministers-secrets/a-41282561) connections of defense minister to Russia.

It only would do that if I found your reasoning convincing. I don’t, nobody else reads here anymore, so let’s drop the point.

Do the Ukrainian soldiers confirm that it's a military target?

&gt; the Russian army is simply erasing the Ukrainian positions from the face of the earth. 

I gave you a link to a blog where a Russian soldier explains how exactly that ""erasing"" is carried out. With them losing half of their battalion before they even managed to get anywhere near engaging. With their soldiers being wiped out in crossfire in the fortified areas. Massive, massive loss of lives on the Russian sides. Ukrainians are well-entrenched, and eventually, when their positions are becoming too destroyed, they move back in a controlled manner to new fortified positions, and the cycle of eliminating Russians repeats.

Russia has a huge problem with the Ukrainian trenches, because Russia ran out of any more or less high-tech shells and bombs. They don't use airburst shells for example. While Ukraine has far superior (accuracy, distance) artillery systems with a wide variety of shells at their disposal.

&gt; You are limited only to the English language, and therefore limited to propaganda. 

You realize that Google Translate exists, right? Haven't I just given you a link to a Russian blog post?

&gt; Ukraine is already conducting the 4th wave of mobilization

Yep. Ukraine still has 5 volunteers per open position, and denies people with no military experience. But they have nowhere near enough hardware to arm everyone. Still, most of the military is always on support roles. Most of the Russian military involved in fighting Ukraine is in Russia. It has a total of 1 million on active duty. Which is a bit more than 700000, right?

&gt; and in Russia there was not even a call for reservists

Full, 100% mobilization of every male, no matter the health, in DNR/LNR, which is hundreds of thousands. They are given WWII-era weapons, no training whatsoever, and are thrown at Ukrainian positions in front of the Russian army. There are almost no men left from those regions.

And what about Rosguard being forced to go to Ukraine or be fired?

What about troops being withdrawn even from Armenia and Syria, at the expense of having to abandon their positions to enemies?

It sure seems to me that Russia is trying its hardest to mobilize everyone it can without declaring a full mobilization, which would effectively mean admitting its defeat. ""The special operation is carried out according to plan"", right?

&gt; Ukraine has stated that it has 500 Russian soldiers in captivity, Russia has stated that it has at least 7,500 Ukrainian soldiers in captivity.

You trust Russia, the country that's been caught fabricating data countless times, e.g. using the same prisoners in multiple places to pretend there's more of them? And how do you know that 2500 surrendered in Mariupol? I don't recall Ukraine confirming that. Hundreds - sure. 2500? Sounds a bit too much. Russia is probably lying to avoid admitting that just a few hundreds killed thousands of Russians and held a dozen BTGs tied up for months.

Where did you get the ""500"" Ukrainian number?

But it's also pretty obvious that Ukraine will have way fewer prisoners. How do you imagine them taking prisoners? Most of the war is carried out at a distance, using artillery. There's not much left after their strikes. And after seeing what the Russian Nazis do to the local population and to their towns, I imagine Ukrainians won't be very motivated to take prisoners in general, especially those from battalions moved from Kyiv. But they might still do it to have someone to exchange for their own people.

&gt; it is a hard war, two European armies are fighting

One army has 10x the military budget of the other, a devastating advantage in tanks, planes, artillery etc. How did it happen that it sucked so badly, and the war turned into pretty much a stalemate? In Sumy, there wasn't even any Ukrainian military, just barely trained territorial defense, and they stopped several BTGs on their own.

&gt; Moreover, since the 16th century it has been one country.

And now they have nothing whatsoever in common. One is a totalitarian dictatorship that arrests people for holding a blank piece of paper, and believes it has the right to enslave other nations and rape or murder anyone who disagrees, the other is a democratic nation that fights for its freedom. The distance is as broad as between Finland and Russia.

That's where the difference in morale comes from, that's why Russians do their best to flee from the fight, why there are almost no volunteers, and IIRC 20% (or 50%?) of those temporarily returned to Russia refuse to go back into the meat grinder.

&gt; These are one-time losses of about ten thousand people.

If 10k people fight to the end, then this would mean 20000-30000 casualties on the Russian side. Such losses are unsustainable by Russia.

&gt;  If Russia succeeds there, then this is a strategic defeat for Ukraine.

It's just another city. The real problem for Russia would be Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. Those are the most fortified cities in the area, and have the most Ukrainian forces protecting them. Losing them would indeed be really bad. Most analysts predicted that Russia should have reached Sloviansk at least a month ago, ever since Izyum was taken, yet here we are. 

And keep in mind that if Sieverodonetsk ends up in a nasty position, then its forces may retreat to Sloviansk.",a7a25c5080e42c88b5a615d9a4ee677d55ba0bc8,True,False,,,,,0,1653768985,,0,{},iacm1yb,False,t3_uz3ci4,False,False,t1_iach46s,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uz3ci4/ukrainian_air_forces_shot_down_russian_su35_this/iacm1yb/,1653768998,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653740185.0,

&gt; The Rosgvardia have previously been described as Putin&amp;#039;s &amp;quot;Private army,&amp;quot; but a large group of the national guards&amp;#039; members were fired after they rejected orders to fight in Ukraine.

&gt; In response, the local governor, Oleg Kozhemyako, reportedly accused Vasyukevich of &amp;quot;Defaming the Russian army and our defenders who are in the fight against Nazism.&amp;quot; Kozhemyako called the communist politician &amp;quot;a traitor.""

I know who it is, I subscribe to it. This does not change the essence of my words.

&gt;Because half of the Russian army is concentrated there, and Russia has at least a 10:1 advantage in artillery in that area? 

Where is the data from? From your fantasies? Check out any authoritative international report on the number of Russian troops. You are right about the artillery. Russia always relies on artillery. And these are precisely the words of Aerstovich that the Russian army is simply erasing the Ukrainian positions from the face of the earth. Yes, progress is slow, because these positions have been prepared for 8 years, but it is coming. It's just a fact, why argue with it.

&gt;You are limited to Russian propaganda, so your knowledge is completely detached from reality.

I have the happy opportunity to speak two languages and understand three languages. I can get information from both Ukrainian (for example, Oleg Zhdanov, retired colonel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, now a military expert) and Russian sources, plus English-language media.  
You are limited only to the English language, and therefore limited to propaganda. And if you sincerely believe that there is no propaganda in your country, then you are its very first victim.

&gt;Do you actually believe that Ukraine gave weapons to 700 thousand people and sent them to the front line? How many people are there in the Russian military?

What does it matter? the fact is, 700 thousand people is a huge force that needs to be destroyed, for which it is necessary to spend ammunition, time, effort, lives. Even if they only have pitchforks, it's still a huge mass.  
At the same time, Russia has not even begun to mobilize reservists who have been on contract service for the past 5 years.

&gt;Yes, because Russia is about to recruit 60 year olds. And because out of those rotated, at least 1/4 refuse to go back. 

Yes, but in reality Ukraine is already conducting the 4th wave of mobilization, and in Russia there was not even a call for reservists, not to mention some 60-year-olds. rzhunimag. Ukraine has stated that it has 500 Russian soldiers in captivity, Russia has stated that it has at least 7,500 Ukrainian soldiers in captivity. Only in Mariupol surrendered 2500 thousand people. Yes, it is a hard war, two European armies are fighting. These countries have some of the strongest and most courageous people on earth. I have friends both in Ukraine and in Russia, I know who these people are. Moreover, since the 16th century it has been one country.  
There is not a single country in the world that has been involved in such a conflict since Vietnam. So why are you surprised?

&gt;Ukraine controls just 5-10% of the Luhansk area. So... if they lose that tiny bit, do they lose the war? Does anything change strategically? Why does it even matter? 

These are one-time losses of about ten thousand people. Plus, the creation of a springboard for an attack on the Donetsk Republic. If Russia succeeds there, then this is a strategic defeat for Ukraine. The front will shift immediately to the Dnieper River, and the two largest cities: Zaporozhye and Dnepropetrovsk. Ukraine has no other significant positions in this region.",faae0966e5b54fb34591c40150f0372c4f5e1bda,True,False,,,,,0,1653766546,,0,{},iach46s,False,t3_uz3ci4,False,True,t1_iabv5g5,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uz3ci4/ukrainian_air_forces_shot_down_russian_su35_this/iach46s/,1653766559,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653737746.0,

We all know how fast people change their interest and it is smth that has been reported in various News Sides that multiple politicians from various countries have those fears.

1706,[],False,,lskd3,,,[],,,,text,t2_gfscl,False,False,"The German government has apparently reduced its military support for Ukraine to a minimum over the past nine weeks. So far, Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) has refused to supply German battle tanks and armored personnel carriers, citing agreements with NATO allies. But as can be seen from documents available to WELT AM SONNTAG, Germany has not supplied any significant light weapons since the end of March.

Between March 30 and May 26, only two deliveries of arms from the federal government arrived in Ukraine. Both contained only small devices. In mid-May, Germany sent 3,000 anti-tank mines and 1,600 more specialized anti-tank directional mines, according to a list.

The main problem facing the Ukrainian army at the moment is the superior Russian firepower in the east of the country. This can counter them with mines little. On Saturday, Russia announced ""complete control"" over the strategically important small town of Lyman in the Donbass region. Air and missile attacks were reported against the cities of Bakhmut and Soledar in the Donetsk region

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described the situation as difficult and announced bitter resistance on Friday. ""The Donbass will remain Ukrainian."" His army protects the country as well as the ""current defense resources"" allow. He had repeatedly called on the international community to supply more arms.

On request, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Defense told WELT: ""The information on specific weapon deliveries is security-relevant and classified, so I ask for your understanding that I can neither provide more detailed information nor confirm details.""

A different German delivery than that of May had reached Ukraine a month earlier. However, this only contained spare parts for machine guns, ""igniters"", detonating cords, radios, hand grenades, explosive charges and mines.

According to Ukraine, the last delivery of anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapons took place on March 25, more than two months ago. It included 2,000 Panzerfaust 3 rockets and 1,500 Strela anti-aircraft missiles.

However, according to a Ukrainian list dated March 29, there is still a need for this ammunition. Thus, in addition to Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and anti-tank weapons, the Ukrainian army also needs Harpoon-type anti-ship missiles. Ukraine confirmed the latter in a letter to Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) on April 9 and May 1.

Germany has not yet complied with these requests, although Chancellor Scholz publicly promised further deliveries. For weeks he reiterated that Kiev's support continued, most recently at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday: ""Putin will only seriously negotiate peace if he realizes that he cannot break Ukraine's defenses. That is why we support Ukraine.”

On Saturday, the Russian President again threatened Scholz in a phone call. According to Russian sources, Putin said further arms deliveries were ""dangerous"". There is a risk that ""the situation will continue to destabilize"" in Ukraine.

Since there has been no help from Berlin for several weeks, the German government is moving away from its allies, who continue to supply light weapons in addition to heavy equipment. Kyiv reported on Saturday that it had received Harpoon missiles from Denmark and more self-propelled howitzers from the United States.

In mid-May, Washington commissioned the armaments company Lockheed Martin to produce 1,300 Javelin missiles for Kyiv. Italy said it would send anti-tank weapons, Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and mortars, and Britain promised hundreds of Brimstone anti-tank missiles.

With regard to heavy weapons, Scholz had issued the motto to only deliver in step with the NATO partners. The support was ""closely coordinated with our partners and allies,"" he confirmed on Thursday. Since no NATO country supplies western-style tanks, this served as a reason for refusing the delivery of German battle tanks and armored personnel carriers to Ukraine.

Industry export applications for the sale of 100 Marder and 88 Leopard 1 tanks to Kyiv have been with the Federal Security Council for five weeks. But there is “no movement” there, as WELT learned from Ukrainian government circles. On request, the Chancellery said: ""Please understand that the Federal Government ... basically only informs about final positive approval decisions.""

At the end of April, the German government announced the delivery of 30 Gepard anti-aircraft tanks. At that time, however, it was not clear where the ammunition was to come from. Four weeks later, the federal government was able to provide 59,000 rounds. However, the first 15 cheetahs will not be delivered until the end of July, as Minister Lambrecht announced. As a reason for the delay, Scholz gave the reason on May 17 that the tanks ""had to be prepared"".

According to Kiev government circles, however, the real reason for the delayed delivery is the training of Ukrainian soldiers on the cheetah, which was probably only completed at the end of July. According to the information, the delivery is related to this.

The training of the first 45 soldiers does not start until June 13th and ends on July 22nd. For the second group of soldiers, it will start on July 18 and end on August 26, which is why the 15 other cheetahs will not be delivered until the end of August.

When asked, the Federal Ministry of Defense stated that it was “an export project by industry”. A spokeswoman said: ""The training of Ukrainian soldiers and the supply of ammunition are also the responsibility of the industry.""",642cd4c87fe75e039efd9dccbf1988aca685b220,True,False,,,,,0,1653763993,,0,{},iacbouq,True,t3_uzto7z,False,True,t3_uzto7z,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uzto7z/despite_promises_germany_has_delivered_hardly_any/iacbouq/,1653764004,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653735193.0,

The downside is that Poland or the Baltics don’t expect France to come to their aid if needed (because they don’t have the forces to spare), which limits the amount of power or influence the French leadership have on their own continent.

It would have been extremely reckless to antagonize Russia during the early and mid 90's. The country was already in free fall and the possibility of it, or parts of it becoming a rogue nuclear power was very real. The reason for the US having Yeltsin had less to do with indecision and a lot to do with who we can trust with the nuke button. 

One of the big things omitted in the article was that we assisted Ukraine to denuclearize. Again, that was to keep the missiles in as few hands as possible.

We certainly could have been more vocal on Chechnya, Georgia and Tartasan. But at what cost? 

One major thing to remember during this time was that there was attempted coups, actual constitutional crisis and, one could argue, an actual coup with the dissolving of the house and replacement with the Duma, a successful coup.

This is a meaningless claim until you pinpoint on a map the location of each downed aircraft.

&gt;You can check all destroyed air vehicles on Oryx.

Hahaha! The very first aircraft Oryx lists is an Su-25 downed on the first day of the invasion, when Russia controlled zero territory. There's no picture of it; Oryx used a story from TASS and an announcment from the Russian ministry of defense as documentation. The list includes an Su-34 that came down in Belarus on March 10 and uses intercepts of radio communications as confirmation. No photos for that one, either. Oryx also lists an Su-34 shot down on May 18 or May 19 over the Donbas using a picture of the pilot and pictures of a memorial service released by the Russians, and not of the wreckage. 

Your claim that all destroyed planes are photographed is complete garbage.

&gt;I repeat, this is the 21st century, Europe. It is not possible to shoot down a plane and that it did not get into the lens of someone's camera.

I repeat, look at Oryx again. There are multiple planes listed as destroyed with no photos of wreckage.

&gt;if you want to believe in fairy tales, this is your right.

I never said I accepted as fact that another Su-35 was shot down. I said your argument that it could not have happened because there are no pictures is garbage. If you want to believe your own fallacious arguments, this is your right. But you should at least read your own evidence and some books on critical thinking so you know why what you are saying is wrong. lol",85171a5f7b4cb4c4ed710f93d6e28aa793cd56cf,True,False,,,,,0,1653761732,,0,{},iac716o,False,t3_uz3ci4,False,True,t1_iab4kk8,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uz3ci4/ukrainian_air_forces_shot_down_russian_su35_this/iac716o/,1653761743,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653732932.0,

It’s just understood that if you don’t want to live a shitty life of servitude you have to fight your way to the top. It’s not like many western countries where being a good team builder can get you places, you have to be an asshole to get anywhere. And society is built around the understanding that the person at the top is responsible and therefore has power over those below them. So if you’re not at the top, then you deserve what you get. 

So Putin fights his way to the top and proceeds to be an asshole to everyone below him (as is the style of the time) As far as he’s concerned Ukraine is below him (since he’s clearly above Zelensky in the pecking order) so it’s entirely normal for him to expect that Ukraine would just roll over and take it (cause that’s what subordinates are supposed to do) and for him to rule Ukraine with an iron fist. Part of that is punishing any intransigence (like resisting the invasion) with whatever force is necessary to get compliance.

They gather the air picture and try their best to pass along threat info and coordinate the air battle, hence the name of the operators in the back (air battle.managera). They rarely, if ever, coordinate with ground forces. It would benefit other ISR platforms that soak up ELINT data.

The Ukrainians will have their own radar network and are doing their own battle management and weapons control to determine which targets and when to attack.

Understanding the ECM suite is beneficial for targeting purposes, but moreso in the long run. It will take a while (months) to backward engineer and test the captured hardware (assuming it's in working condition). Once they're able to do that repeatedly, they can pass along how the Su-35 protects itself against radar threats. Air and ground forces can hopefully use that data to counter the ECM or develop ECCM accordingly.

If the Su-35 is flying with its radar off, it can still use passive sensors like its radar warning receiver, sure. But, a radar can still emit and hit that Su-35 whether or not none, any, or all of its systems are not (passive or active). If that rwr has the frequency range of the S-300 radars, it can warn the pilot without the S-300 know. But, ECM is not passive. It requires emitting energy in the relevant ranges to defeat threats. If the S-300 has ECCM, it can when ECM is being used and possibly defeat it. ECM and ECCM has been back and forth tit for tat when it comes to developing systems for decades now.",70a6b3b2da29bc97e00c6704b328b612562b4982,True,False,,,,,0,1653759880,,0,{},iac36oh,False,t3_uzmksc,False,True,t1_iac12ez,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uzmksc/big_blow_to_chinese_russian_air_force_as_their/iac36oh/,1653759897,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653731080.0,

It is your logic that is flawed, because you're arguing out of an non-informed position. There is simply no way possible that Germany in 1989 did more for the NATO then today.

The vast majority of the population of Ukraine – 89% – perceive Ukraine as their homeland: from the Western region (97%) to donbas (89%).

Only a small part of the population of Ukraine shares separatist ideas. The idea of separating the region (region) from Ukraine and joining another state - 8% (most of all - in the Donbas - 18%, the least - in the Western region - 0.5%), the idea of creating an independent state on the basis of southeastern regions is generally supported by 11% of the population of Ukraine, in the South - 10%, East - 10%, in the Donbas - 18%, and the idea of separating the south-eastern regions and their accession to Russia is supported by 9.5% of the population of the South. 11% of the population of the East and 27% of the population of Donbas.

Only 6% of the population would like their region to secede from Ukraine and create its own independent state, most of all in donbas (17%), least of all in the West (2%). We would like their region to secede from Ukraine and join another state 9% of the population, most of all in the Donbas (24%). Moreover, this desire in Donets increases with age: among young people under 30, they would like to disconnect their region and join 13% to another country, among people over 55 years old - 29%.

At the same time, a significant part of the population (32%) believes that there are deep political regions, linguistic and cultural events, economic disparities that in the future they can separate and either create their own states or join the different other states. Most of all, this is believed in the Donbas (58%) and in the South (48%), the least such opinion is inherent in the Center (20%) and the West (20%). Moreover, in the Donbas, this opinion about significant contradictions between regions is especially common among older people – 66% of people over 55 and 49% - under the age of 30 think so.

The vast majority of the population of Ukraine – 72% – believe that there are serious threats to Ukraine, the opposite opinion is shared by only 7.5%. Moreover, this anticipation of threats is characteristic of all regions of Ukraine. The three biggest threats are citizens: the seizure of Ukraine or part of the territory by other states (48%), the disintegration of Ukraine into several parts (43%) and economic decline (42%). At the same time, in the Western region, more than in others, they are afraid of seizing Ukrainian territories (63%), in the East - economic decline (58%), and in the Donbas - loss of state control, chaos (31%).",412995de120e921572caa82a38d2f64feafdd2ef,True,False,,,,,0,1653759503,,0,{},iac2e7s,True,t3_uzs0wu,False,True,t1_iac1mxe,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uzs0wu/in_032014_dem_initiatives_made_national_public/iac2e7s/,1653759514,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653730703.0,

The south Vietnamese ranged from not caring who was in power provided they were free to get on with their life to somewhat supportive of the US involvement. The war against North Vietnam didn’t have enough violence for the US to win (if they had done linebacker 5 years earlier and continued for another couple of weeks North Vietnam would have folded. Instead the US persisted with Rolling Thunder and basically pissed around doing a half-assed job) end result was a bunch of negotiations and they lost.

Iraq was a shit fight because the US pissed off half the country by sacking the whole military and ruling class which cost them 15 years of chaos and fighting but they are more or less holding it together now.

Churchill again, from his very warm tribute to Chamberlain after his death from cancer shortly after the outbreak of war
“It fell to Neville Chamberlain in one of the supreme crises of the world to be contradicted by events, to be disappointed in his hopes, and to be deceived and cheated by a wicked man. But what were these hopes in which he was disappointed? What were these wishes in which he was frustrated? What was that faith that was abused? They were surely among the most noble and benevolent instincts of the human heart—the love of peace, the toil for peace, the strife for peace, the pursuit of peace, even at great peril and 1618 certainly to the utter disdain of popularity or clamour. Whatever else history may or may not say about these terrible, tremendous years, we can be sure that Neville Chamberlain acted with perfect sincerity according to his lights and strove to the utmost of his capacity and authority, which were powerful, to save the world from the awful, devastating struggle in which we are now engaged. This alone will stand him in good stead as far as what is called the verdict of history is concerned.

But it is also a help to our country and to our whole Empire, and to our decent faithful way of living that, however long the struggle may last, or however dark may be the clouds which overhang our path, no future generation of English-speaking folks—for that is the tribunal to which we appeal—will doubt that, even at a great cost to ourselves in technical preparation, we were guiltless of the bloodshed, terror and misery which have engulfed so many lands and peoples, and yet seek new victims still. Herr Hitler protests with frantic words and gestures that he has only desired peace. What do these ravings and outpourings count before the silence of Neville Chamberlain's tomb? Long and hard, hazardous years lie before us, but at least we entered upon them united and with clean hearts.”",a8c3bc1ab42c73e0dcd21ab1c9631c901873b324,True,False,,,,,0,1653759233,,0,{},iac1twg,False,t3_uzlhiq,False,True,t1_iab13tg,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uzlhiq/germany_at_nato_the_war_raises_many_questions_can/iac1twg/,1653759251,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653730433.0,

The biggest issue are Dual use components. Like components that can be used for military and civil components (Like a Control Panel for a washing machine that could be used for military Gear aswell). Those components have gone to russia through different Channels (some Bosch components Out of Germany have been sold to a company in eastern europe and the company forwarded those to russia to use for military Gear). Those Dual use components are hard to track (for example, a russian company produces mobile Phones and Imports GPS parts for their Phone. Those parts could also be used for guided missles) and thats the biggest issue for them. In general, those components (in Germany at least) cant be sold to arms companies, but as it seems, many nations are setting Up companies (or middle men) to Forward those to arms companies.

Hence, Germany could promise and, piece by piece, deliver dozens of PzH 2000 without actually reducing the current capabilities of the BW. 

Granted, BW capability wouldn’t increase, but given that Germany is not currently at war and is extremely unlikely to become a party in a conventional war (with whom?) in the near future, time is on their side. 

In summary, Germany could absolutely do more, even if they are not prepared to degrade the current BW operational capabilities. Agreeing to delivery in the medium term is all anyone that matters is asking for. And that is not happening as far as I can tell.

&gt; In addition to this, Aleksey Arestovich, adviser to the President of Ukraine, directly stated the following: ""the ukraine is not capable of adequately conducting counter-battery work, we simply do not have the necessary weapons.""

Because half of the Russian army is concentrated there, and Russia has at least a 10:1 advantage in artillery in that area? Still, they are barely moving, and suffering heavy casualties.

You are limited to Russian propaganda, so your knowledge is completely detached from reality.

&gt; Russian troops are in the absolute minority and still continue to actively advance.

""Tell me you know nothing about warfare without telling me you know nothing about warfare"".

Do you actually believe that Ukraine gave weapons to 700 thousand people and sent them to the front line? How many people are there in the Russian military?

And what type of weapon has caused the most casualties in this war?

&gt; Russia did not even rotate the initial grouping of forces

Yes, because Russia is about to recruit 60 year olds. And because out of those rotated, at least 1/4 refuse to go back. Desertion is massive. Russia already lost at least 1/3 of its army, it's worse than all of Afghanistan combined, and it's only been 3 months.

&gt; Russia now controls 90% of the Lugansk region.

So nothing changed over a couple of months?

By ""Region"", I mean Donetsk too. General vicinity.

&gt; After the encirclement, Ukraine will lose completely control over this area.

""Encirclement"" = ""lose control""? Wow. You should really stop reading those weird Telegram channels.

1) Russia failed almost every past attempt at encircling any amount of Ukrainian forces in the past (with the only exception being fundamentally indefensible Mariupol located at a really bad spot), so there's no reason to expect it to be more successful here.

2) Ukraine controls just 5-10% of the Luhansk area. So... if they lose that tiny bit, do they lose the war? Does anything change strategically? Why does it even matter? The Russian propaganda is weird, in the absence of victories it has to set the goalposts so that any minor village taken is a major defeat of the Ukrainians. Meanwhile, Russia keeps getting pushed back almost everywhere else, controls less and less ground, and Ukraine is gathering forces for a counter-attack.

And Ukraine will probably finally get US MLRS systems soon. So far the reviews of M777 are extremely positive, I wonder how much faster they'll be able to kill the Russians.",98551fcedf2b7284aa7f4bae87baba9de5cdff5b,True,False,,,,,0,1653756110,,0,{},iabv5g5,False,t3_uz3ci4,False,True,t1_iabrqo0,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uz3ci4/ukrainian_air_forces_shot_down_russian_su35_this/iabv5g5/,1653756121,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653727310.0,

There never was any symetry. The Warsaw pacts primary purpose was what they really did. Subjugate ""defector"" countries. East Germany 1953, Hungary 1956, Czechoslovakia 1968. They invaded and removed governments.

The secondary purpose, the Warsaw pact trained to reach the Rhine in a week, NATO trained to prevent that.

There is no symetry, although you could go with mirroring, because a mirror turns the picture, but opposites is more fitting.

And Russia did NOT apologize to any Eastern European country for 40 something years of occupation. Instead they meddled, threatened, had ""technical difficulties"" in the economic and energy realm and started speculating about invading neighbours like the Baltic states.

Then the Eastern Europeans ran for NATO.

Then Russia complained about the expansion, being the very reason for the expansion.

In the ~15 years after the collapse of the USSR, their population dropped by 5 million. The problem is, while they stopped having kids in ~1988, they now have less young people, and it's not the 60 year olds that are going to be making kids to replace their population. [Estimates](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/russia-population) project their population to drop by 1/7 this century. Less young people means labour shortages in the long-term, and while they could theoretically rely on migrants from the post-Soviet space, I don't think Ukrainians will be very eager to go work in russia, even if it is no longer a fascist state in the near future.

It also means less young able-bodied men for their military, and the state of their economy might just aggravate the already rampant alcoholism. Not to mention you need labour to pay pensions for the retirees.

Look at the population charts by age. Sweden's is pretty healthy. Russia's is pretty fucked.

&gt; We are also verry educated.

I've only been to Sweden a couple of times and never to Russia, but I am sure Sweden is a far better place to raise a family than Russia. With the current economy, sanctions, repression, I don't think Russians will want to bring *more* children into the world - except the uneducated ones that currently have a war-boner.

There is about 40 000 Ukrainians at this very moment in NATO countries training for this exact action. Unofficial information is that they will be ready to take counter measures in middle of summer.

https://www.businessinsider.de/politik/deutschland/vor-drei-jahren-verkaufte-rheinmetall-marder-panzer-an-jordanien-jetzt-soll-die-ukraine-dafuer-70-prozent-mehr-zahlen-b/

Extrapolating the 2019 prices for Jordan, 100 Rheinmetall Marder including guns and breechblocks would cost just under 89 million euros. The unit price would therefore be roughly 890,000 euros. This is considerably less than the unit price of 1.5 million that Rheinmetall is now charging for the delivery of 100 Marder to Ukraine. If we take the 2016 price for Jordan - roughly €660,000 per Marder - the discrepancy with the Ukraine offer becomes even more glaring.

Admittedly, this also includes ammunition, maintenance and training. However, Rheinmetall quoted the same conditions for deliveries to Jordan. Even inflation between 2019 and 2022 does not explain the large price difference. It is still possible that Rheinmetall is pricing the increased resource and energy prices in recent years into the offer to Ukraine. However, even these do not justify a price increase of 70 percent between the current offer to Ukraine and the offer to Jordan in 2019 for a mere overhaul of the Marder tanks.

Shows how far from reality you are. There are dozens of videos in the telegram where Ukrainian soldiers refuse to follow orders by entire battalions, and complain about the lack of necessary weapons. In addition to this, Aleksey Arestovich, adviser to the President of Ukraine, directly stated the following: ""the ukraine is not capable of adequately conducting counter-battery work, we simply do not have the necessary weapons.""

In this context, you are right. Russia underestimated the possibilities of Ukarina and did not count on such a response. Now the war has taken on a more protracted character. Nevertheless, Russian troops are in the absolute minority and still continue to actively advance. Ukraine has already mobilized 700 thousand people.

There's a pattern here.

When everyone you meet is an asshole, then it's most likely that  it's you that's the asshole.

I am sure that both sides are trying to get a good deal and it's causing friction, but as a result it's seriously harming Germany's reputation. Plus the fact that Poland still hasn't got a deal to backfill the tanks that it has already sent to Ukraine, is going to prevent other countries from doing the same. Ukraine doesn't have the luxury of time. 

 I know the German govt argument is that Poland is asking for tanks that the German army does not yet have, but if NATO tanks are needed to fight, Poland will need them before Germany does. The fact that the Bundeswehr doesn't have the latest Leopards is also a symptom of Germany's underspending on defence over the past couple of decades.

Population plays a major role, the more enslaved citizens in your borders you have the more that you have to keep your GDP going while the military goes and plays with fighting on the playground. Modern warfare only stays the same until it changes.

I don’t care what us does. I don’t really care what any of the countries do, but if countries want to self preserve it’s easy to see what not to do. The internets and news in countries are not designed for a free thinking society, they are propaganda machines meant to control their people. The propaganda machines manipulate their little followers and turn them into little cheerleaders for whatever the govs desire. Then they send their followers to go fight their wars. The highest in organized crime. One big mafia or gang that promises a pension plan for its members.

The way you got your panties in a bunch tells me your a little cheerleader too. A little follower tooth on the gear type and the eldest of our humans realize before time is up that the petty affairs of man didn’t really matter that much anyway. Furthermore, if your on earth the anthills we call countries have transitioned in power in general. Every people who thought they were a superpower of war and might have all failed at some point in the timeline. The key to not fail is to realize you don’t swing the biggest stick when you don’t so that you don’t bite off more than you can chew.

The world has changed and reality only follows the schedule of the propaganda brainwashed until new truths are too evident to deny.

Does it also ruffle your feathers to know that even if Ukraine was given twice the weapons from other people that it doesent necessarily mean they would be doing any better. Russia has 3 times the population of Ukraine and more fuel and weapons than it needs regardless of how much you don’t like it. Who’s side the gov has told you to be on is the side you will take because you are likely a blind follower. Just another tool in the shed.

In a war strategy if your goal is to win it’s like a game of poker, don’t just show your cards, drag it out a little, put the global economies in a fritz because either way of you have a product the world Requires to function and it’s an ace in the hole, and then strike hard when you feel like the time is right for domination. If they had wanted to just shut them down from the jump they could simply choose which way to do so like hypersonic missiles or whatever but in war like in most things in life it’s about timing.. others who oppose you are less likley to concede to your will if your strike is over in a day but if you cripple the some of the world economies in a drag out situation you have a bigger seat at the table when the dust settles. 

That’s the strategy part and yes it is also good if you have more people than the other guy because it just does. More people means more tools in the shed and I have an feeling you know what that’s like. 

I’m of no concern over your opinion and need to move on to talking to people about things like why the f don’t womens boobs work anymore.. why is their such a large market for baby formula.. other animals in the food chain don’t have issues feeding their young.. a lot of bad choices later now we don’t have working tits either.. rising tides, global worming, non working tits, wars, public unrest, all over crashing economies, a dwindling family of antibiotics for humanity, gun/population control issues and so on and so on. It’s unlikely it will matter for very long who wins what war because humanity itself has already made a mess of the house as it is in individuals quest to control others. It has been kind of fun toying with you though in the meantime though.",bdaa4d4ebbe0e34c9486ecdce7046072a60fd20d,True,False,,,,,0,1653753876,,0,{},iabqdz4,False,t3_u7w8nf,False,True,t1_iabhy0x,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/u7w8nf/ukrainianconflict_megathread_6/iabqdz4/,1653753893,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653725076.0,

&gt; Adding further pressure, the main opposition party, the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), is planning to submit a parliamentary motion this week demanding Germany supply Ukraine with tanks. The move could have drawn support from Green and FDP lawmakers and led to a critical defeat for Scholz in parliament, undermining trust in his government.

I get that this stuff is complex, but Scholz is seen as reluctant, perception is that he's forced to take each step even within Germany, and this leads to people questioning even legitimate delays. When other people in parliament purpose sending weapons why didn't he just say yes, let's send weapons?

If we're going to talk about Russian trolls amplifying bad stuff, I'm worried about them taking pressure off delivery of weapons to Ukraine.

We're all friends here, we can criticise each other without going to war, it's one of the great features of the EU, so don't get sad face about pressure to keep our collective foot on the gas even when it's directed at one country for a while.

There are news articles of civilians returning to Kharkhiv despite continued shelling, and many analysts say that Ukraine has already won the ""Battle of Kharkhiv"". The only thing the Russians are doing in the area now is shelling from a distance, mostly.

It's a distinct battle from the Battle of Donbass, which takes place primarily on land that Russia had been permitted to occupy since ~2014. Seems possible that Russia pulled most of their troops out of the Kharkhiv area in order to focus on the Donbas, because they want to be able to end the war in a state where they don't have to say that they lost the DPR and LPR. 

Even in mid-March, there were people predicting that the Battle of Donbas would turn into some kind of horrible multi-month meat grinder, eventually ending in the collapse of Russian military capabilities, assuming effectively unlimited international support for Ukraine.

Donbas is the terrible battle that some in the West did not want to fund: the one where Ukraine is possibly fighting until Russia literally runs out of tanks and missiles (which means the rest of the world must make sure that Ukraine does not run out of equipment first).",862e6a40ebb1bc48f440731284825e4828942237,True,False,,,,,0,1653750727,,0,{},iabjmrv,False,t3_uzieem,False,True,t1_iaars97,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uzieem/the_invaders_in_the_kharkiv_region_massively/iabjmrv/,1653750743,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653721927.0,

3075,[],False,,AlfredLTenniscourt,,,[],,,,text,t2_4fnzkmiu,False,False,"The poverty is a weird thing. I spent a little time there about 10 years ago. My observations were that people's needs were basically met. A loaf of nice bread cost about 30¢. Other food was similarly cheap and of generally good quality. And I actually really enjoyed my time in rural areas. In urban areas, the poverty lacked the desperation and violence I am used to in the dangerous areas of  America, but drunks laid around everywhere, and every nook and cranny smelled like piss. Street food was more expensive than I would have imagined. But if you were content to live simply, you could.

But there is another sense in which the place is desperately poor. Your average lawn care business owner here in America has a $60,000 hot rod diesel pickup that he uses to haul his mowers around. Everyone has two cars, one of which is actually a truck, and runs them five or ten thousand miles a year in America. Normal people own tractors, hot-rods, boats, rototillers, guns, bows, arrows, fishing poles, etc. There is utterly no analogy to that in Russia. And while Americans could, if they decided to, move massive amounts of material by simply mobilizing every unused pickup truck and hauling ass down the interstate, Russia would be trying to re-route trains for a month to approximate the same effect. And while Americans have legions of people who know how to use and maintain complicated equipment, Russia has very few.

Honestly, if everyone lived like the working class in Siberia, we wouldn't have to sweat global warming, and a host of other problems. And I hope the world moves that direction in some ways, simplifying, localizing, giving up the insane excess of American car culture (that I love and don't want to give up myself).

But people were also afraid to appear in a picture. And they don't have enough children to replace themselves. And you have to have a passport to get on a train to the next big town.

I'm not sure I'm making a coherent point here. But insofar as there is one, it is this: Russians are not desperately poor in the sense that they are insecure in their ability to find food and shelter. However, the nation does not have the type of fluid, wasteful economy that Americans are used to, that can be switched over to wartime production or to support a war logistically with any facility.

Now Russia minimized their failures and actually managed to draw some of their reserves, but on the other hand Ukraine didn't get most of the promised aid in time, (because it's late, some people were dragging it out or other reasons) which in turn made Ukraine, with depleted reserves, actually lose initiative to reinforce defence.

But, as they have already demonstrated numerous times in this war, the Russian command doesn't seem to value the lives of individual Russian soldiers very highly at all - and so, if we expect them think and act like us, we risk coming to the wrong conclusion.

Seems like you're smarter than high ranking ukrainians who in recent weeks have made comment after comment to the contrary.

Keep smoking the copium, though.  

As i said, the situation is far from certain. What is certain is that the war won't be won by redditor's taking puffs from the copium pipe and constantly painting things in the most positive possible interpretation.

""Ukraine just needs to endure, keep stacking up the kills and wait for the Russian implosion. Then they sweep them back beyond the border.""

Probably the most destressing thing about the last few days is not a fundamental change in the larger military situation, as there hasn't been one. It's that Russia is not looking completely stupid. 

There was much hope here that the bad morale, bad logistics, bad leadership and ensuing massive losses would result in a complete collapse of the Russian front, as occurred in the north in April. Then the fight could be taken to Crimea and Russia itself, resulting in a complete victory for a unified Ukraine that leaves Russia broken and utterly humiliated.

While hope remains for a summer counter offense with newly trained recruits and western weapons  that will break the Russian lines, the reality is that a partially competent Russian Army will be much harder to rout. A bloody stalemate of limited offensives and counter offensives seems to be the order the order of the day.

They've learned next to nothing. They continue to send poor quality troops piecemeal at Ukrainian positions.

And even then they're constantly losing this artillery to Ukrainian drones and counter battery fire, aka modern warfare. 

3 months into the fighting and Russia are scraping the barrel for men over 40 with combat experience and are throwing them and old T62 tanks into the fray.

The issue was not a major issue in the country. That’s why it was so infuriating. It was unnecessary. But once the propaganda campaign got into full motion, it was unstoppable. Typically unpolitical, apathetic people were turned into voters by promises of ‘freedom’, more money, and a better future. In Mein Kampf, Hitler wrote about the best  way to use political propaganda. He writes: forgot about the intellectuals and the successful people, aim for the lowers intellect, keep the message simple and inspiring, bold and memorable (Take Back Control, Get Brexit Done). That’s how you create a movement. That’s basically what happened. The dumb people were mobilised and used in a power grab. Boris Johnson was an EU supporter when it suited him (beforehand). A Brexiter when he saw it as a vehicle for his career.

Monday's European summit in Brussels will address the growing risk of famine in countries dependent on Ukraine's agricultural exports, which have been blocked by Russia following its invasion of the country on 24 February. The EU is ready to mobilise all possible resources to facilitate the release of the grain accumulated in Ukrainian silos and ports. And on the table is even the possibility of launching a naval mission to escort the passage of cargo ships from Ukraine through a Black Sea infested with mines and guarded by Russian ships and submarines.

By land. Or by river. Or even by sea. The European Union considers it essential to remove as soon as possible the thousands of tons of corn, barley and, above all, wheat, blocked on Ukrainian territory for three months. The draft conclusions of the summit, to which EL PAÍS has had access, ""strongly condemns the destruction and illegal appropriation of Ukraine's agricultural production by Russia"". And it calls on Moscow to ""end the blockade of Ukrainian ports and allow the export of food, particularly from Odessa"".

The operations devised to export all this produce by rail through Poland or by river to the Romanian port of Constanta are not working as planned. And Brussels is now considering, according to EU sources, the launch of a naval mission derived from the common security and defence policy to ensure that the grain leaves directly from the Ukrainian city of Odessa, the port on the Black Sea that channelled most of the export until the start of the war launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The naval operation to remove the Ukrainian grain would pose an extreme risk of a possible military clash with the Russian navy. But Brussels is watching with almost equal dread the outbreak of a humanitarian crisis in the countries whose most basic food needs depend on Ukrainian exports. Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi telephoned Putin on Thursday and Volodymir Zelenski on Friday to sound out the possibility of an agreement between the two sides that would allow Ukrainian ports to be cleared and grain to be shipped out. But Putin blames the problem on European sanctions and Draghi has warned that a food crisis ""of gigantic proportions and terrible human consequences"" is looming.

According to European Commission figures, Tunisia imports 53% of its wheat from Ukraine, Libya 44% and Egypt 26%. In India and Pakistan, which have almost 1.7 billion people, dependence on Ukrainian wheat is almost 50 percent. The shortage of grain in all these countries could trigger, in addition to a famine, an economic and social crisis that would lead to waves of migration that would sooner or later arrive in Europe.

Until the outbreak of the war, Ukraine exported an annual average of 18 million tonnes of wheat, 24 million tonnes of maize and nearly five million tonnes of barley, according to figures from the International Grains Council, an intergovernmental organization that promotes stability in the world grain market. The sudden halt in Ukrainian exports, blocked by the Russian navy, has jeopardized the stability of that market and the food security of part of the planet.

""The debate on a common security and defence policy mission is inevitable,"" says an EU source. The EU currently has 18 such missions in operation around the world, some of them naval, such as the one in the Mediterranean to ensure compliance with the arms embargo on Libya or the one combating piracy in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Somalia. But all the sources consulted acknowledge that an operation in the Black Sea is an unprecedented risk for European forces.
The first difficulty, of a diplomatic nature, would be to allow European ships to pass through to the port of Odessa.

Since 1936, the entry of warships from non-coastal countries into the Black Sea has been regulated and limited by the Montreux Convention. That international agreement gives the key to the straits of entry to the Government of Turkey.

The government of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has supported UN resolutions demanding that Moscow end its aggression against Ukraine. But Turkey is the only Nato country that has distanced itself from the sanctions imposed on the Kremlin by the EU and the US. And it has not hesitated to set conditions for admitting Finland and Sweden into the Atlantic Alliance, two historically neutral countries alarmed by the return of war to the European continent.

Even so, ""Turkey would give permission for the passage of European ships,"" says a senior EU source. The reason for optimism is based on the fact that it would not be an aggressive operation but of an eminently humanitarian nature because the feeding of millions of people could depend on its success.

""Russia's military aggression risks having a dramatic effect on global food security,"" says the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, in his letter of invitation to the 27 European leaders for the summit on May 30-31 in Brussels. And the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, accuses Putin of using food as a weapon of war, just as he has done with energy supplies.

""Russian artillery is deliberately shelling granaries in Ukraine and Russian warships in the Black Sea are blocking the departure of Ukrainian ships full of wheat and sunflower seeds,"" von der Leyen lamented during her speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday.

Michel said in his letter: ""At the European summit we will discuss concrete ways to help Ukraine export its agricultural production using EU infrastructure. The Council President adds: ""We will also look at how to better coordinate multilateral initiatives in this regard. The meeting of the 27 will be attended remotely by the President of the African Union, Macky Sall, a sign of the EU's concern about the vulnerability of African countries.

The EU wants to demonstrate to the countries at risk of famine that the lack of grain is not the result of European sanctions, as Russian propaganda claims, but of the armed blockade of Ukrainian ports. The draft conclusions of the summit include ""a commitment to keep world trade in food commodities free of unjustified barriers"". And it promises ""solidarity towards the most vulnerable countries"".",e74e82bc12fb91e443541710228d80b89dfb7a38,True,False,,,,,0,1653739971,,0,{},iaazpp0,True,t3_uzm1zh,False,True,t3_uzm1zh,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uzm1zh/eu_considers_naval_mission_to_free_ukraines/iaazpp0/,1653739984,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653711171.0,

Troops need rest and resupply, new units need rotated in, new positions need prepared, stock needs to be taken of new enemy dispositions.  Its just a natural part of warfare.  

You want your culmination point to arrive after you have achieved your objective, then you can prepare for the next objective.  If you have not reached your objective when culmination point arrives, you may be in a bad position for the next phase of the battle.

Part of the reason Russia struggled so bad at the start of the war is that the BTG system is very light on supply and has a small time scale between culmination points, but Russia was running way behind on its planned (overambitious)objectives.  They have now moved to a system more able to last longer between culmination points and are setting more reasonable objectives.

Right now Russia needs to take the city before their attack culminates, Ukraine is trying to stop this happening.  If Russia is successful they will be in an ideal position both to withstand any Ukrainian counteroffensive in the area, and to set up their next offensive.  If Ukraine is successful Russian forces will be open to any counteroffensive, and even if Ukraine cannot launch one or it fails, the next Russian offensive will still have to take the city buying Ukraine more weeks.

If Ukraine withdraws it allows the Russians to achieve their objective early, giving Russia a much stronger position with regards to withstanding any counter attack or launching their next attack.  It robs Ukraine of weeks of time.  So it should only be done if Ukraine is sure it will save troops it will otherwise lose.

If you are going to do a strategic maneuver like a shortening of your frontline you definitely don't do it whilst the enemy is active since they are able to attack you whilst you do it and follow up.  So even if Ukraine plan on abandoning the city they would prefer to wait rill the Russian attack has culminated and do it more safely.  So they would only do it whilst Russia is actively attacking if they were sure the city would be encircled.",0a915b58e4be5877013b8f1008c13d7844aac384,True,False,,,,,0,1653738429,,0,{},iaaxedp,False,t3_uzjbzt,False,True,t1_iaauey1,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uzjbzt/ukrainian_strategy_in_the_donbas_has_certainly/iaaxedp/,1653738440,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653709629.0,

But I’m just pointing out, there was not party unity for leaving the EU. In fact most of the conservative MPs were not in favour and initially voted against it, but they were too cowardly to do what’s in the best interest of the people. They were too concerned for their jobs. The fact is, the whole Brexit thing was orchestrated by a very small group of conservatives and a massive propaganda push (putin played a massive part of that, as did some very questionable wealthy donors).

They had a birth bust starting in the 1990s because of the collapse of the soviet union, and the uncertainty that followed. After the 1998 financial crisis, they massively cut investments in education, so their population is less educated. Add the pandemic and the current sanctions, the mass exodus of foreign companies, including the ones with the expertise to exploit many of their oil fields, and you can expect a terminal decline in their population. I wouldn't be surprised if the russian empire finally collapsed in the next 15 years, with minorities rejecting Moscow's rule.

Thing is - if Germany said straight up ""piss off Ukraine, die alone"" - it would've been better than current situation, because then we wouldn't have to build our plans around the fact that we'll get extra weapons.

The only way this works is if you have high quality goods/services that you want to protect - things already going well in your nation that you want to promote.

A complete oil and gas embargo for Germany would mean months of warlike reality. Industry would come to a complete stop, even bare necessities such as hospitals would be reduced to a level of functionality not unlike actual war zones. 
The remaining reserves would be commandeered, posing a very real risk of civil uprising. 
Plus we’re already on the verge of a massive recession. 

The price of stopping the war through an embargo for the rest of Europe would be to serious consequences to every aspect of life — for months. 

Would you be willing to pay that price for a 
complete stranger? Would you really? 

I hate nativity in the context of war. Human lives are too precious to be considered with flawed logic, and unrealistic expectations. 
Also, what’s your proposal how to end this war? I’m genuinely curious. What’s your (realistic) idea, how this horrible chapter of mankind should be completed? 

The whole situation is a mess, but I would argue even from a moral point of view it’s unjust to expect nations that depend on Russian gas and oil to support an embargo. By the same logic we could solve every other issue on the world. Poverty, hunger, economy. You name it. With that level of sacrifice we could fix it all. For the meager cost of (impossibly large) inconvenience. 

Isn’t even arguably the lesser inconvenience for Ukraine to just cede their territory and agree to a demilitarized zone?

&amp;#x200B;

Belgians were motivated to stay in  the war by virtue of fighting in the one portion of their lands that was still free. If all of Belgium falls there is a real chance that the belgian forces would give up, pack up their things and surrender. And the british who joined the war explicitly to defend belgium, it was a morale booster that a part of it remained free and that they hadn't completely failed in their mission. And most importantly, with determination they could succeed in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a simple view on the matter to just think that politicians do this to please themselves or eachother. People in high places takes morale and psychology of the people on the ground seriously. Sometimes they make the mistake of thinking that the things their morale hinges on is the same as the people on the ground, but not nearly the majority of the time. The important part is to also understand that the people on the ground don't have the full picture like we do. And even a single retreat, even to improve the position of the army as a whole, can have a catastrophic effect on morale on the ground locally, or it can even spread through the entire line.",f217c05cd69c0da6dc3d607257804cf8b40224eb,True,False,,,,,0,1653730427,,0,{},iaanqbz,False,t3_uzcarl,False,False,t1_iaah0kc,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uzcarl/why_doesnt_ukraine_retreat_from_severodonetsk/iaanqbz/,1653730441,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653701627.0,

Also, Ukraine will need a bridgehead to take back the LPR eventually.

Surely if Russia did that to us it'd be front-page news and we'd be in a bipartisan national rage over such an attack on our sovereignty.   I've been laughed at for suggesting it's a real thing.

Not many people laughing now, thank god.

The Council of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (hereinafter - the Council), which took place on May 27, 2022 in Kyiv, considered issues of church life that arose as a result of the military aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine.  Based on the results of the work, the Council approved the following:

The Council condemns war as a violation of God's commandment ""Thou shalt not kill!""  (Exodus 20:13) and expresses condolences to all those who suffered in the war.


* The Council appeals to the authorities of Ukraine and the authorities of the Russian Federation to continue the negotiation process and search for a strong and sensible word that could stop the bloodshed.
* We disagree with the position of Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia on the war in Ukraine.
* The Council approved the relevant amendments to the Statute on the Administration of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which testify to the full independence and autonomy of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
* The Council approves the resolutions of the Councils of Bishops of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and the decisions of the Holy Synods of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which met after the last Council of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (July 8, 2011).  The Council approves the activities of the Department of Affairs and Synodal Institutions of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
* The Council was considering the restoration of peacemaking in the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
* During the period of martial law, when the relations between the dioceses and the ecclesiastical center are complicated or absent, the Council considers it expedient to give eparchial bishops the right to decide on certain issues of eparchial life within the competence of the Holy Synod or the Primate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.  further, while restoring opportunities, informing the clergy.
* Recently, a new pastoral challenge has been particularly acute for our Church.  During the three months of the war, more than 6 million Ukrainian citizens were forced to go abroad.  Mostly Ukrainians from the southern, eastern and central regions of Ukraine.  Many of them are faithful to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.  That is why the Kyiv Metropolitanate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church receives appeals from various countries with a request to open Ukrainian Orthodox parishes.  It is obvious that many of our compatriots will return to their homeland, but many will stay for permanent residence abroad.  In this regard, the Council expresses its deep conviction that the Ukrainian Orthodox Church cannot leave its faithful without spiritual care, must be with them in their trials and organize church communities in the diaspora.  It is necessary to further develop the mission abroad among Orthodox Ukrainians in order to preserve their faith, culture, language and Orthodox identity.
* Recognizing the special responsibility before God, the Council expresses its deep regret over the lack of unity in Ukrainian Orthodoxy.  The Council perceives the existence of a schism as a deep painful wound on the church body.  It is especially unfortunate that the recent actions of the Patriarch of Constantinople in Ukraine, which resulted in the formation of the ""Orthodox Church of Ukraine"", only deepened misunderstandings and led to physical confrontation.  But even in such crisis situations, the Council does not lose hope of resuming dialogue.  In order for the dialogue to take place, the PCU representatives need to:
!!!!* to stop the seizure of churches and forced transfers of parishes of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
!!!!* to realize that their canonical status, as enshrined in the ""Statute of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine"", is in fact non-autocephalous and significantly inferior to the freedoms and opportunities in the implementation of church activities provided by the Statute of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
!!!!* to resolve the issue of canonicity of the hierarchy of the PCU, because for the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, as for most Local Orthodox Churches, it is quite obvious that to recognize the canonicity of the hierarchy of the PCU it is necessary to restore the apostolic succession of its bishops.
* The Council expresses its deep conviction that the key to the success of the dialogue must be not only the desire to restore church unity, but also the sincere desire to build one's life on the principles of Christian conscience and moral purity.

Summing up the results of the work done, the Council offers a prayer of thanksgiving to the Merciful Lord for the possibility of fraternal communication and expresses hope for an end to the war and reconciliation of enemies.  According to the holy apostle and evangelist John the Theologian, may ""grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love, be with all of us, especially brothers and sisters in the Risen Christ"" (2 John  1: 3).",b5d8fa7f2f3207c054cc44b0c3e53aed9dc17fe4,True,False,,,,,0,1653727884,,0,{},iaal0g4,True,t3_uziq21,False,True,t1_iaaiodk,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uziq21/resolution_of_the_cathedral_of_the_ukrainian/iaal0g4/,1653727900,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653699084.0,

Turkey have them, and Turkey is a NATO member. I think it's safe to say most NATO countries have all the detailed specs at this point, with or without Turkish cooperation.

If the S-400 does what it says on the tin, then Russia could have wiped out anything the Ukrainians sortied from the comfort of the motherland; MANPADs and smaller SAM systems could have taken care of anything operating below the S-400's radar horizon. This of course presupposes that one values the lives of one's pilots more than one values missiles.

The Council of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (hereinafter - the Council), which took place on May 27, 2022 in Kyiv, considered issues of church life that arose as a result of the military aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine.  Based on the results of the work, the Council approved the following:

 The Council condemns war as a violation of God's commandment ""Thou shalt not kill!""  (Exodus 20:13) and expresses condolences to all those who suffered in the war.
 The Council appeals to the authorities of Ukraine and the authorities of the Russian Federation to continue the negotiation process and search for a strong and sensible word that could stop the bloodshed.
 We disagree with the position of Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia on the war in Ukraine.
 The Council approved the relevant amendments to the Statute on the Administration of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which testify to the full independence and autonomy of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
 The Council approves the resolutions of the Councils of Bishops of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and the decisions of the Holy Synods of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which met after the last Council of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (July 8, 2011).  The Council approves the activities of the Department of Affairs and Synodal Institutions of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
 The Council was considering the restoration of peacemaking in the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
 During the period of martial law, when the relations between the dioceses and the ecclesiastical center are complicated or absent, the Council considers it expedient to give eparchial bishops the right to decide on certain issues of eparchial life within the competence of the Holy Synod or the Primate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.  further, while restoring opportunities, informing the clergy.
 Recently, a new pastoral challenge has been particularly acute for our Church.  During the three months of the war, more than 6 million Ukrainian citizens were forced to go abroad.  Mostly Ukrainians from the southern, eastern and central regions of Ukraine.  Many of them are faithful to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.  That is why the Kyiv Metropolitanate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church receives appeals from various countries with a request to open Ukrainian Orthodox parishes.  It is obvious that many of our compatriots will return to their homeland, but many will stay for permanent residence abroad.  In this regard, the Council expresses its deep conviction that the Ukrainian Orthodox Church cannot leave its faithful without spiritual care, must be with them in their trials and organize church communities in the diaspora.  It is necessary to further develop the mission abroad among Orthodox Ukrainians in order to preserve their faith, culture, language and Orthodox identity.
 Recognizing the special responsibility before God, the Council expresses its deep regret over the lack of unity in Ukrainian Orthodoxy.  The Council perceives the existence of a schism as a deep painful wound on the church body.  It is especially unfortunate that the recent actions of the Patriarch of Constantinople in Ukraine, which resulted in the formation of the ""Orthodox Church of Ukraine"", only deepened misunderstandings and led to physical confrontation.  But even in such crisis situations, the Council does not lose hope of resuming dialogue.  In order for the dialogue to take place, the PCU representatives need to:
 to stop the seizure of churches and forced transfers of parishes of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
 to realize that their canonical status, as enshrined in the ""Statute of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine"", is in fact non-autocephalous and significantly inferior to the freedoms and opportunities in the implementation of church activities provided by the Statute of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
 to resolve the issue of canonicity of the hierarchy of the PCU, because for the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, as for most Local Orthodox Churches, it is quite obvious that to recognize the canonicity of the hierarchy of the PCU it is necessary to restore the apostolic succession of its bishops.
 The Council expresses its deep conviction that the key to the success of the dialogue must be not only the desire to restore church unity, but also the sincere desire to build one's life on the principles of Christian conscience and moral purity.

 Summing up the results of the work done, the Council offers a prayer of thanksgiving to the Merciful Lord for the possibility of fraternal communication and expresses hope for an end to the war and reconciliation of enemies.  According to the holy apostle and evangelist John the Theologian, may ""grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love, be with all of us, especially brothers and sisters in the Risen Christ"" (2 John  1: 3).",26ba60e6d8a5d94dc68a15b7a319ebfba392cb6c,True,False,,,,,0,1653725738,,0,{},iaaiodk,True,t3_uziq21,False,True,t3_uziq21,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uziq21/resolution_of_the_cathedral_of_the_ukrainian/iaaiodk/,1653725748,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653696938.0,

I think you've kinda got it the other way around. 

Air defense systems aren't used as an offensive tool to establish air supremacy, they're defensive against missiles and aircraft.

You need fighters to clear the skies, and follow up with air defense systems to hold up supremacy. 

If you simply put out an air defense system, you'd probably get it destroyed as is.

&gt;Russia have sold nearly all of the working systems abroad/have no reloads/lost them somewhere.

They have used it, but in extremely limited numbers and I assume this has to do with the fact that they're very expensive, in limited numbers and they're mostly stationed along Russian borders.

They have a long range of up to 70km and very high precision thanks to intertial+GPS guidance, and are specifically designed as anti-artillery systems - which is exactly what Ukraine needs right now, as the current Russian successes are mostly based on overwhelming use of artillery. With these rockets in combination with counter-batter radars, the Ukrainians should be able to destroy Russian batteries from beyond their range; moreover, HIMARS is much more mobile than the M777 towed howitzer.

I'm just an internet nerd studying these things on paper, but, depending on the number of systems that the US will send, it looks to me like this could be a game changer in this phase of the war.",7a77b4185c712bb3d66bfe84063fc1a2f5f01dcb,True,False,,,,,0,1653723900,,0,{},iaagoae,True,t3_uzi5lj,False,True,t3_uzi5lj,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uzi5lj/analysis_m270a1_iac_and_m142_himars_are_able_to/iaagoae/,1653723913,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653695100.0,

I FORGET if it was this, or the another about the F-35, but they were saying the new generation raised on twitch gaming reflexes are the future of these systems as they rely on much less physical input to perform the same tasks.  ie.  

In an F-15 to do a a roll, you move the giant stick between your legs, your legs even impeding, you pull back on the stick too hard?  you'll tear the wings right off.  

In an F-22, you have a pressure sensitive stick off to the right of the cockpit, it takes a little pressure to achieve the same results on a stick that doesn't really move.  The pilot said, and I love this, the first line in the manual states ""You can fly this plane with reckless abandon.""  The airframe will kill the pilot long before it fails.  There are systems for when the pilot blacks out as well, to keep the plane from crashing.

Guess we'll all have to wait for Pakistan to have another case of the stupids to see what the S400 can really do in combat.

The brahmos, the S400, and their missile systems are world class anti ship and Air defense systems in their respective classes, there is nothing false there. Sure, the brahmos hasn't been combat tested, but you get the idea.

From the American point of view, it is clear that the objective now is to weaken Putin's Russia permanently in order to send a message to China too:

&gt;What began as an effort to make sure Russia did not have an easy victory over Ukraine shifted as soon as the Russian military began to make error after error, failing to take Kyiv. The administration now sees a chance to punish Russian aggression, weaken Mr. Putin, shore up NATO and the trans-Atlantic alliance and send a message to China, too. Along the way, it wants to prove that aggression is not rewarded with territorial gains.

On the European side, they are worried about the dangers of isolating and humiliating Vladimir Putin. This could only lead to something even worse in the future in their eyes.

Henry Kissinger's media appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos highlighted these differences in perception. Kissinger pleaded for Ukraine to accept the loss of Crimea and agree to cede the entire Donbass to end the war:

&gt;“Pursuing the war beyond that point would not be about the freedom of Ukraine, but a new war against Russia itself,’’

On the Ukrainian side, it is a direct refusal that was opposed.

The Ukrainians have been fighting against Russia for more than three months. They are not willing to give up everything for a peace that would not really be a peace. Kissinger seems to forget that we are no longer in the era of the Cold War...

Zelensky himself has put forward contradictory opinions since the beginning of the conflict about a possible neutrality of Ukraine in order to reach peace with Russia more quickly. But the fact that Russia has continued to plunder his country has probably changed the situation.

Still, the Americans have the idea that it will be up to Zelensky and the Ukrainians to make hard choices at the end of this war.

From a political point of view, Joe Biden also keeps in mind that the Republicans would not fail to criticize him if Putin could come out of this conflict with a redesigned Europe. He would appear to be the big winner in spite of everything.

The situation is therefore more than complex, and it is difficult to see at present an outcome that would satisfy all the parties involved.

Every passive restraint until now has only seen escalation on his part as he constantly probes the boundaries, if that is the case why should we abide by the same sort of restraint Russia fails to adhere too?

""I'm a Nazi. I’m a Nazi,” said one of the men, Aleksei Milchakov, who was the main focus of the video published on a Russian nationalist YouTube channel. “I'm not going to go deep and say, I’m a nationalist, a patriot, an imperialist, and so forth. I’ll say it outright: I’m a Nazi.”

&gt; Joe Biden has accused Vladimir Putin of trying to &amp;quot;Wipe out&amp;quot; Ukraine&amp;#039;s culture but suggested the plan had at least partially backfired by spurring the expansion of Nato in Europe.

&gt; The US president told 1,200 graduating cadets in Annapolis, Maryland, on Friday: &amp;quot;Not only is he trying to take over Ukraine, he&amp;#039;s literally trying to wipe out the culture and identity of the Ukrainian people. Attacking schools, nurseries, hospitals, museums, with no other purpose than to eliminate a culture.""

&gt; On the ground, in the besieged eastern Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk, the situation appeared bleak, with Luhansk&amp;#039;s governor, Serhiy Haidai, saying Ukrainian forces may need to retreat after Russian troops entered the city, the largest in Donbas still held by Ukraine.

Countries are wasting their taxpayers dollars on sending piles of weapons to a country that doesent have enough manpower to operate the weapons that are being sent. It’s actually a very simple equation regardless of what gov propanda or hope speech folks have to say about it. It’s in the numbers. 1 ass can’t drive 2 tanks at the same time, 1 person can’t shoulder 2 rocket launchers at the same time, it’s just simple math..

USA could have spent that money to either import fuel instead of all our gas hikes or they should have just straight up joined the war..

You either shit or get off the pot. We paid for a lost cause because they didn’t need piles of weapons- they needed piles of soldiers.. 

Instead the USA has been blowing our cash and pissing off China as well and while we have 350 million people in our country well China has 1.4 billion in theirs. Not a good idea to mess with that type of numbers difference. In addition to that all our crap around our homes says “made in China” it seems our gov is not very smart.

Here is where it is mean and ugly. 

I don't think Ukraine is going to allow the Russians to quit with any Ukraine territory annexed.

They will need to fight very hard to push Russia out, and it is much more effective to force the Russians to wear themselves out attacking.

If Ukraine were unable to balance the budget on this defense they could retreat, but they couldn't count on  Russias continuing attacks. That means they might retreat and be immediately forced to attack and recapture the area they previously defended before Russian occupation can be accepted as the status quo.

It is much more efficient to hold their bridgehead than need to attack across the river later.

They are getting between 3:1 to 5:1 casualty ratios by forcing Russians to attack. When the Ukrainians switch from attack to defense they can't hope for that level of bleeding. They will cause more massive casualties but suffer more as well. Their attack is likely to be much shorter duration so it will be sustainable, and while technically not casualties, they should be able to rout or force the surrender of large groups of Russians. 

A few strategic strikes on command centers and supply depots, with SOF strikes that further disrupt command and communication and provide a sense of being surrounded leaves Russians extremely vulnerable to a command vacuum where they are going to collapse to some degree. Collapse tends to cascade, and as confidence fades from its current low point, the Russian forces become less and less of a threat.

It will still take a period of risk and commitment from Ukraine, so it is strategic to delay, while the Russians throw themselves into the waiting meat grinder of defenses.",64c4b3db8f7cf3906f28753be41a356864c74e1b,True,False,,,,,0,1653715621,,0,{},iaa6ocb,False,t3_uzcarl,False,True,t3_uzcarl,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uzcarl/why_doesnt_ukraine_retreat_from_severodonetsk/iaa6ocb/,1653715637,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653686821.0,

&gt; In March, Everett traveled to western Ukraine and the surrounding borders of Moldova and Romania, where for over 10 days, she was asked to capture &amp;quot;Individual, human stories behind the inconceivable numbers of refugees,&amp;quot; as she tells Mashable.

&gt; A large majority of the people Everett met in Ukraine were involved in war efforts, from finding ways to distribute medical supplies to the frontlines to helping others who had been displaced by offering refuge and support.

&gt; Everett, who has photographed refugees across Kenya, Turkey, Afghanistan, and countless other countries, said that in many ways, the scenes in Ukraine reflect a similar plight to that which refugees face worldwide.

&gt;So I do wonder what the Ukrainian General Staff knows about Lyman that we, and the guys on the Siversky Donets, apparently don't if Russia is still only trying to (according to my Yandex translation) gain a foothold.

&gt;Or maybe the daily updates are just way backlogged.

&gt;Another interesting claim was that Russia failed to gain success in Severodonetsk despite Hayday's claims of Russia capturing a hotel, and the TikTok battalion publishing a video of them actually being in the city proper. 

&gt;Those guys generally stay far away from the actual front

&gt;I generally don't like it when the General Staff report has these inconsistencies with the previous day's footage and word from the front, because it really makes me doubt the rest of the things they've reported.

I don’t know how solid that is, that’s just what they say. Arguably the greater strategic Union victory was happening almost simultaneously in Vicksburg, Mississippi. But Lincoln couldn’t give an address in Vicksburg, and the importance placed on Gettysburg might (might) be a regional bias. Or it might not.

But anyway, back to Gettysburg. The fact that this turning point was a battle on Union soil instead of Confederate soil I think gives all the indication needed that the war was not going well for the North at that point in the eastern theater. That being said, the North had the bigger economy and (slightly) better equipment. I would not draw inspiration for Ukraine from the outcome of that war.

They know where they can slip out and get away. They also know where the enemy will think they will go when in reality they might go somewhere completely different. So they can actually really cause havoc for the invaders. Yes, it's very sacrificial because it's a lot of work and there's a lot of attrition and losses, but nothing compared to the damage they can inflict on the Russians. I've looked at some maps which show basic unit placements and honestly there are places where one regiment is holding off a battalion or several battalions. 

Yes it's dangerous and bloody and sacrificial. But it buys the Ukrainians time. If you can tie them up so they have to gangbang your group, it just makes it harder for the invaders to commit to serious pushes against your guys back in the main line.

Speaking of which, as the enemy surrounds you, they close in and concentrate their forces to the point that their density makes it easy to always hit something no matter where you point and shoot. I'm generalizing of course, but this is why history is full of stories of ""last stands"" where 60 soldiers killed 500 invaders and so on.

Mariupol is a great example... the Russians were forced to devote tons of resources, energy and manpower to smaller and smaller areas. The only reason Azovstal fell is the guys literally ran out of supplies. But I think we're going to find out that the Russians lost a lot in Mariupol. A lot of soldiers that would otherwise have been used on the main line, and couldn't, thus making it hard for the guys actually on the main line.

So, long story short, that's why I think it looks weird what the Ukrainians are doing. But they know what they're doing.

So it'd be fairly unlikely that they'd have a hell of a lot, especially considering they'd likely need multiple pontoon bridges at every crossing point to sustain an offensive.

This Tweet is part of a longer speech he held at the Catholic Day.
I am absolutely no fan of Scholz but given the circumstances that this speech was held at a church day i haven't found it to be to bad.

Scholz is lagging a good PR Team because the Tweet itself was taken out of context by who ever posted it in his Press Office. Here is the full Text translated with DeepL. 
1 more example why Politicians should stay away from using Twitter.

&gt; Dear Dr. Stetter-Karp,
&gt; Dear Mrs. Bossong
&gt; Dear Bishop Fürst,
&gt; dear Bishop Bätzing,
&gt; Dear Lord Mayor Nopper
&gt; and above all dear visitors of the Katholikentag,
&gt; 
&gt; Our discussion today is entitled ""Turn of the times and cohesion - society and politics in uncertain times"". I would like to start with the turn of the times.
&gt; 
&gt; That's a big word. Nevertheless, I think the term is appropriate. The war in Ukraine is very close to us not only because it is happening geographically on our doorstep, but also because we feel for the Ukrainians, for those who fear for their lives and the lives of their loved ones on the ground, and also for those who have found refuge here with us. And it touches us because we feel that this war is not directed against Ukraine alone, but against values and convictions that unite us as a society, that define who we are: Democracy, freedom, justice, human dignity.
&gt; 
&gt; Putin's war is directed against a peace order that grew out of the commitment ""Never again!"" after two devastating world wars. He wants to return to the law of the strongest, back to a world in which the powerful dictate their will to the weaker.
&gt; 
&gt; Let's not forget: this war has repercussions all over the world. I was in Africa this week, visiting three countries and talking to the heads of government and presidents there. Many people there are worried about the war, because they all sympathize with the Ukrainians, but also because the consequences of this war will be felt all over the world, for example when it comes to food security, when it comes to the price of vital energy supplies. In many of these countries, as many people know from their active involvement here, this is by no means assured anyway, and under the current circumstances, of course, all this will become much more difficult. That is why it is quite clear to me that Putin must not be allowed to get away with his cynical, inhumane war.
&gt; 
&gt; Hence also the tough sanctions against Russia, hence the support for Ukraine, humanitarian, economic and with a lot of funding, and hence also the delivery of weapons to such a war zone. That is something that we as a Federal Republic have never done before.
&gt; 
&gt; I know that this raises difficult questions, politically, ethically, and also very personally, questions that you are certainly discussing intensively here at the Katholikentag and also in your families, circles of friends, and parishes. At the heart of the matter is the question: Can violence be fought with violence? Or, as some people put it: Can peace only be achieved without weapons? It is clear that such questions may and must be discussed. We must treat the different views with respect, however much war and its terrible consequences agitate us.
&gt; 
&gt; But I also say: My position on this is clear. We have decided to stand by the victim of this war of aggression, so that injustice does not triumph over right, so that brute force does not prevail as a means of politics. Peace does not come through violent submission; justice is the prerequisite for peace. Bishop Franz-Josef Overbeck expressed it in a similar way recently when he rejected unconditional non-violence for himself and called instead for the overcoming of violence through law.
&gt; 
&gt; Ultimately, this is also an imperative of solidarity with the weaker. Or to speak with the motto of the Katholikentag: It is about sharing life. That is what the churches and the many volunteers in parishes, Catholic associations and organizations in our country are doing. I am extremely grateful for that.
&gt; 
&gt; We experienced this during the pandemic, when we witnessed compassion and consideration in a whole new way. Many church institutions and congregations in particular did a great job in providing care, in helping neighbors or simply by being there and alleviating loneliness. Now, in times of war in Ukraine, they are all back. Church buildings become housing for refugees, fundraising campaigns for Ukraine are launched, volunteers help refugees to arrive in everyday life.
&gt; 
&gt; This gives confidence to those affected, but also to me as a politician, confidence that we as a country and as a society will come through this turning point well, and confidence that this war will not prevail over our solidarity and cohesion. Thank you very much for that.

Orthodox schisms are nothing new though. Moscow itself schismed from Constantinople in 2018, for the third time. The last was in 1996.

What’s also interesting is that it is not based on any theological belief (like whether the Eucharist should be leavened or unleavened), but entirely ecclesiastical differences (who’s in charge of whom etc). Most Orthodox schisms are largely theological, with a smattering of ecclesiastical differences.

But both of Moscow’s recent schisms with Constantinople were caused entirely on ecclesiastical grounds, namely, one of their former colonies created an autocephalous church and told Moscow to GTFO. (Estonia in 1996, and Ukraine in 2018).

I hope this leads to the unification of all Orthodox churches in Ukraine under the Kyiv Patriarchate.

Having such lax laws around hard drug use (to the point where it's supported by the king county government, which gives out needles and places to shoot up) has caused our cities to turn into literal shit holes.

I'm sorry but hell no. We fought for 20 fucking years, spent countless amounts of blood sweat and money to drag that backwards corner of hell kicking screaming into the developed world. We spend TRILLIONS on a country with a GDP smaller than your local Walmart, building schools, hospitals, and infrastructure. We trained teachers, doctors, and soldiers. We fought their war for them for decades. 




But when it was time for us to leave (10 years past time), what did they do? They crumbled like a house of cards and caved immediately. The 'leaders' stuffed their briefcases with the money they had stolen from the people, people who didn't give two shits about it regardless while the 'army' didn't even run. They would've needed to actually be at their posts to run.





Now all of a sudden it's America's fault. Oh America shouldn't have left so early. Oh America shouldn't have left at all. Oh America do something!





I used to blame Biden for that clusterfuck too, and yeah, our departure was a cluster. But you know what? Fuck Afghanistan. I feel absolutely no sympathy for anyone over 14 in that 'country.'





So many people in Africa and the Middle East crying about how it's racist that the US/EU only care about Ukraine and that we arent helping them. We care because the Ukrainians care. The free world is fighting for people who actually give a single fuck about what that means.

The reason why I've posted here is because I believe that there is an irrational hatred toward Germany in this thread.

We all know that this was a false hope. Noone knew that it would lead to the atrocities that Russia committed and is still committing to this day.

Yes you like to stay cold and rational while Ukrainians are dying, hope u like ur cheap natural russian gas. ALso you doing every bit of possible to pretend to be the real victim and how offended you are on bad wordies towards Sholz, Steihnmehier Merkel, any bad word against any person in your government is a personal offence to every German, apparently? The level of fucking ego.

 1. ""the idea that economic ties with Russia would lead to their liberalization."" this is the dumbest idea that i ever heard in my fucking life and its boggling my mind that adult, but a number of adults could actually believe such imbecilic ideas, or selling such ideas as a façade to the population could actually work. Worked with China will work with Russia right?

2.Why there was no any feeling towards Ukrainians or Belarussians, but only Russians CONVENIENTLY, particularly Russian KGB elites and relatives of all the communists and NKVD butchers, who slaughtered Ukrainians by millions, erased their language and culture historically? Committed genocide of Crimean tatars, which are now only 10% of population of Crimea? Do you know where major events of ww2 taken place and what territory was a huge target for both Hitler and Stalin, or how many Ukrainians died in WW2? Nobody cares right, maybe you considered Ukrainians some kind of second grade people, no agency no sovergneity no nothing, They still looked at eastern Europe trough the eyes of an imperialist and they looked at Ukraine as a colony with a center at Moscow.

3. The idea that sending weapons into active warzones will lead to escalation and more bloodshed. SO now you don't wanna send weapons to people you fucked over with years of conscious decisions, thanks a lot. Yes Ukrainians on occupied land by Russians are very grateful for your pacifism, particularly in Mariupol and Butcha, uh oh neverminded, they dead, sorry they were Ukrainian and not Russian, but allowing genocide to happen is pacifism, so we are good. So what's so hard forgetting Ukrainian language, history and culture, and learning Russian ""history"" in schools, i don't get what these Ukrainians are crying about. Today Ukrainian, tomorrow Russian or dead, what's the big deal? Rape and torture is really overblown problem too, you see, some people say some bad words about some politicians, that's the real issue! People are making too much of a big deal from Putin's claim that Ukrainians do not exist, and they are all ruzsian, and articles posted by russian propagandists explaining in detail about the goal of destroying Ukrainian European identity.

Your version of pacifism consisted historically of throwing Ukrainians under the bus to please the Russian fascist elite, which very conveniently preserved the interests and comfort of ""putinvesrtanders"". Do i need to bring up Minsk agreements and ""Steihnmehier's formula""? Where Russia wasn't even part of the conflict officially but a mediator? Its because of those pacifist ideas you were pleasing people who were doing the most German bashing of them all, and were saying ""we can repeat it"" instead of ""never again"" like the rest of the Europe?  All that for what, explain to me, to be contrarian to USA? To say Merica bad? Ukraine was corrupt, that's why it wasn't good enough for NATO, but Russia is not corrupt at all apparently, all is good, don't look, dont look we are making some big cash here.

&gt; To support nine MLRS launchers, we needed four HQ vehicles (M577, my home for three years), 12 HEMTT ammo trucks, to shuttle ammo from weapons depots to the launchers. Two fuel tankers. Eight 2.5 ton trucks—for ferrying food, small-arms ammo, and mechanical spare parts. Two 5 ton trucks, for the same purpose. One recovery vehicle, to tow broken vehicles away (which happened like every five miles of movement). And 26 Humvees—to carry leadership (both officers and and non-commissioned officers), mechanics, the guy who ran the armory, the guy who ran our supply room, a decontamination specialist, guys who fixed broken radios, medics, and a bunch of other people I’ve forgotten. Here’s the details if you’re really interested. 

&gt; In total, the battery had 64 vehicles. Or 55 vehicles to support the nine vehicles actually shooting anything. In terms of troops, the battery had around 300 soldiers. just 27 of them sat in those nine MLRS launchers. That’s what “logistics” means. If you see an army has, say, 1 million people. Just assume that the part of that army that shoots stuff is a fraction of that number, maybe 75,000-150,000.

But now there is no politburo either.  There is the inner circle and the security council (but some of those appeared surprised by Putins decision to go to war)

Its not about holding onto power. The key thing is not who replaces him, but what they will do.  Will they continue and double down on the war?   Every past leader distanced himself ftom the previous one and the real unknown is how much support there will be for a failing war with an increasingly hard hit economy.   Its fairly obvious there are elements of the FSB that likely leaked intel to the US in the runup.  There are elements in the military like the retired major general in charge of the retired staff officers, who publicly wrote a letter opposing the war in January and was quite accurate in his prediction.

The thing is whoever takes over will either have to mobilize - which isnt going to happen no matter how much Strelkov-Girkin calls for it, or use nukes.

Putin who has consolidated his power for 22 years has not called for mobilization because it would mean everything he said about Ukraine is a lie (the 15yr sentence for calling it a war etc) 
Now you would need to conscript from Moscow and St. P and already the soldiers on the ground have no clear reason why they're there. 


Putin ending up like Idi Amin after his Tanzania debacle (and the equivalent of the Ukrainians going in and toppling him) is far less likely.

But there are other internal methods and they've happened in Russias past.

The defeat in the Russo Japanese war with all the popular support and the arrogance in the media then  made it hard to hide the humiliating defeat and ceding of territory.  That contributed to the revolution.

Even more, in 1917 when Russias army collapsed they went home and any officers who got in the way were shot, and the govt fell.

Given the morale, crappy supply of the army (expired rations, etc, and just the numbers who walked away,,  even the legion that supposedly switched sides, that may be a higher likelihood than Ukraine going in.

As for the general population, sure there are few protests, but inthe 91 coup attempt over 200,000 showed up in the square in support.

By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation.

Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn't.

If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was.

The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was.

Yet Olaf Scholz keeps delaying. He or people close to him come up with novel reasons for this hesitancy by the hour, many of which are either contradictory or flat out wrong.

&gt;After over a month of stalled offensive, Russian forces have finally managed to make steady progress near the ruined town of Popasna in the theater’s southeast. Russian forces dangerously compromised the key T1302 highway (nicknamed ‘the road of life’) connecting the twin city of Sieverodonetsk-Lysychansk with the Donetsk Oblast.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now Russia keeps the principal Ukrainian supply line under fire control and threatens to cut it off completely.  
&gt;  
&gt;But alternatively, a continuing Russian rush from the north also pushed the weary Ukrainian defenses in the Siverskiy Donets riverside. Following a massive artillery barrage and airstrikes upon the key town of Lyman, Ukrainian forces had to retreat south again.  
&gt;  
&gt;Continuing Russian attempts to cross the river and finally merge with the Popasna axis is raising great fears of a large Ukrainian group getting trapped and isolated in Sieverodonetsk-Lysychansk, which would pave the way for a potential debacle.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yet, according to the latest developments, the Ukrainian command opted toward reinforcing the Sieverodonetsk garrison rather than withdrawing. Russia still has to fight through over 20 kilometers to finally close the pocket.  
&gt;  
&gt;And large Ukrainian forces, including the 79th Airborne units, are still holding defense in the.

Russian forces began direct assaults on built-up areas of Severodonetsk without having fully encircled the city and will likely struggle to take ground in the city itself.

Russian forces in Lyman appear to be dividing their efforts—attacking both southwest to support stalled forces in Izyum and southeast to advance on Siversk; they will likely struggle to accomplish either objective in the coming days.

Russian forces in Popasna seek to advance north to support the encirclement of Severodonestk rather than advancing west toward Bakhmut.

Positions northeast of Kharkiv City remain largely static, with no major attacks by either Russian or Ukrainian forces.

Russian forces continue to fortify their defensive positions along the southern axis and advance efforts to integrate the Kherson region into Russian economic and political structures",96a04554bfcb019620b8fa71aa4242f005f776b4,True,False,,,,,0,1653696280,,0,{},ia98sz8,True,t3_uzbbog,False,True,t3_uzbbog,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uzbbog/russian_offensive_campaign_assessment_may_27/ia98sz8/,1653696293,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653667480.0,
