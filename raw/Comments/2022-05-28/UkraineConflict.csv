Not just America.  The entirety of the west is backing Ukraine.

Governments should fear their people.  

It's a dangerous road and one not taken lightly, but it is one that at times needs to be taken.  Sometimes it works out for the better, sometimes not.  Case by case. 

It worked out very well in Ukraine, seeing their nation grow in prosperity since.

The wounds are too deep, some survivors lost their family in these horrible massacres by European civilians after the liberation, it's so shocking we come to realize humanity itself has a very thin layer of civilized education which is easily worn thin amid the chaos of wars or some mass frenzy. No country or people is off the hook since it's human nature at its worse, we can only strive to educate ourselves and the future generations but fanatics like Putinists will always come up, or religious fundamentalists, to force their supremacist agendas on their victims, wreaking havoc on world peace. 

I think not only communist China but also Iran and North Korea are also real threats to world peace. And the worst is, even Taiwan thinks Tibet is Chinese, when we know it's not!

None.  There are none.  Resistance to supporting Ukraine is miniscule, virtually nonexistent.

Supporting Ukraine is vastly popular in the west, nearly universal, and has been the single most uniting bipartisan event in a decade.  Right and left leaning folks both pretty much universally support it.

See, we people in the west? We like our freedom and democracy.  A lot.  It's kind of our thing.

You'll find more people arguing for NATO boots in Ukraine than abandoning Ukraine.

Be happy the west is just supporting Ukraine, rather than bitch slapping the shitty Russian military into the dirt.

The point is that this destruction of a large vibrant port city makes it now unlivable and likely too costly to repair.

It will be filled with pensioners and serfs from the western RF. Ukrainians will be ethnic cleansed. 
This is why the Russians wanted to drive the west from Berlin. The west in Berlin was an attractive advertisement for market capitalism that was too close for ideology and propaganda to circumvent. The fear was Soviets would lose its control over communism and eventually it did. 

It was not a physical attack that Putin feared.  If Ukraine controlled corruption, the Gini Coefficient narrowed,  and Ukraine became a huge Czech Republic, Russia feared a huge migration of the very people they could not afford to lose.

Obviously the Ukrainians see this destruction as an existential crisis. The US and UK are coming to believe this.

You seem to present this like Americans just tromped in and changed the government, but Ukrainians did it, and absolutely wanted it.  They wanted to be a part of the EU, and not be under Russia's thumb - this isn't even remotely up for debate, it's literally specifically what they were protesting about.  It had broad support even across Ukrainian parliament.

Russia's just butthurt here because nobody *wants* to be a part of a shithole country.  I mean, why would you? Part of Russia, where it's illegal to even protest, or part of the West where you have personal freedoms and a MUCH better life? 

Because that's just it: you can't go in with guns to make someone want to be part of your country.

Hell, take Iraq and Afghanistan and what failures they were.  Incidentally, I am not American, and I was a part of the Feb 15th protests around the world against the Iraq invasion - I'm personally very happy that my country did not participate in that.

Russian Wins in Eastern Ukraine Spark Debate Over Course of War
Pocket of Ukrainian forces at growing risk of encirclement
Slow pace of Russian advance could also favor Ukraine

Russian troops are making steady progress in Ukraine‚Äôs east on the back of more-concentrated artillery and air power, now controlling almost all of the Luhansk region and threatening to encircle thousands of Ukraine‚Äôs most experienced troops.

That is sparking fears that Russia could be poised for a bigger breakthrough, and leading to increasingly panicked calls from Kyiv for even more powerful offensive weapons.

Russia‚Äôs capture of a series of towns including Popasna means its forces hold 95% of the Luhansk region that makes up the northern half of the Donbas area. On Friday, Ukraine‚Äôs military command said Russian troops were pushing on from Popasna toward the town of Bakhmut, 32 kilometers (20 miles) west, seeking to isolate Ukrainian forces in a pocket of government-held territory around Sievierodonetsk.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the Russian gains as ‚Äúslow, but I‚Äôm afraid palpable, progress,‚Äù in a Bloomberg interview. He also backed Ukrainian demands for supplies of longer range multiple launch rocket, or MLRS, systems as ‚Äúwhere the world needs to go.

new york times  YESTERDAY:

One of the fascinating things about running this website is the interesting people who get in touch with me passing on their stories and insights. I received this one last year from an engineer that, as a young man, worked at Boeing. He worked in minor structural test, major structural test and finally, and very luckily, Flight test on the 737 program. He says:

‚ÄúYour site contains one very common error about the 737 program that was propagated, I suspect, by a press that was not paying attention.  The first flight was on 9 April 1967, I was there to see it.  However, it did not happen anywhere near as described.  The flight was delayed that day by minor electrical system troubles common to any new complex machine.  There was a breaker that would not stay in.  The press had been informed of the flight, of course, and were all waiting make deadlines.  They had been issued (I suspect) press kits.  After some delay it was decided to go ahead without solving the problem.  Take off was made to the north on Boeing Field (BFI) runway 31L.  I am unsure as to what happened in the cockpit but the aircraft did not complete a ""two and one half hour flight"".  It instead did a large pattern and landed back on 31L ten to fifteen minutes after take-off, taxing back to the Boeing ramp.  It had never been planned to go Paine field and was fundamentally based a BFI for the entire flight test program.  Although some testing was done at Grant County airport and Edwards Air Force Base. There was one and only one 737 (tail number N73700) moving under its own power at that time.  There was a second 737 (a -200, tail number N9001U) also parked at the same ramp that the prototype returned to.  The second aircraft was in United colors and it was not possible to confuse it with the prototype.  As the prototype taxied in the news folks were packing there cameras.  N73700 taxied up and was backed in right next to them by a tug.  When I got home that evening I was treated, on TV, to the same story about the two and one half hour flight.  Since then every account I have ever seen tells the story of the glorious first flight.  Now that I am retired I am a making minor effort to correct the record.

Zelensky‚Äôs Choice: Territorial Integrity or Grinding War
Mr. Zelensky has been careful not to expand his aims toward a larger degradation of Mr. Putin‚Äôs regime. He has said repeatedly that he wants the Russians pushed back to where they were on Feb. 23, before the large-scale invasion started.

Only then, he has said, would Ukraine be prepared to negotiate seriously again with Russia about a cease-fire and a settlement. He said again this week that the war will have to end with a diplomatic solution, not a sweeping military victory.

But even those aims are considered by some European officials and military experts to be ambitious. To get there, Ukraine would have to take back Kherson and the ravaged city of Mariupol. It would have to push Russia out of its land bridge to Crimea and stop Russia from annexing large parts of Donetsk and Luhansk.

Many experts fear that is beyond Ukraine‚Äôs capability.

While Ukraine did remarkably well in the first phase of the war, Donbas is very different. To go on the offensive normally requires a manpower advantage of 3 to 1, weaponry aside, which Ukraine does not now possess. The Russians are making slow but incremental gains, if at a high cost in casualties. (While Washington and London are happy to provide estimates of Russian casualties, sometimes rather high, according to some military experts, they say little about Ukrainian casualties. Ukraine is treating those figures as state secrets.)

washington post YESTERDAY

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/05/26/ukraine-frontline-russia-military-severodonetsk/

DRUZHKIVKA, Ukraine ‚Äî Stuck in their trenches, the Ukrainian volunteers lived off a potato per day as Russian forces pounded them with artillery and Grad rockets on a key eastern front line. Outnumbered, untrained and clutching only light weapons, the men prayed for the barrage to end ‚Äî and for their own tanks to stop targeting the Russians.

The ones who stayed were based in the town of Lysychansk. From there, they were dispatched to Toshkivka, a front-line village bordering the separatist areas where the Russian forces were trying to advance. They were surprised when they got the orders.

‚ÄúWhen we were coming here, we were told that we were going to be in the third line on defense,‚Äù Lapko said. ‚ÄúInstead, we came to the zero line, the front line. We didn‚Äôt know where we were going.‚Äù

The area has become a focal point of the war, as Moscow concentrates its military might on capturing the region. The city of Severodonetsk, near Lysychansk, is surrounded on three sides by Russian forces. Over the weekend, they destroyed one of three bridges into the city, and they are constantly shelling the other two. Ukrainian troops inside Severodonetsk are fighting to prevent the Russians from completely encircling the city.

That‚Äôs also the mission of Lapko‚Äôs men. If Toshkivka falls, the Russians can advance north toward Lysychansk and completely surround Severodonetsk. That would also allow them to go after larger cities in the region.

When the volunteers first arrived, their rotations in and out of Toshkivka lasted three or four days. As the war intensified, they stayed for a week minimum, sometimes two. ‚ÄúFood gets delivered every day except for when there are shellings or the situation is bad,‚Äù Khrus said.

And in recent weeks, he said, the situation has gotten much worse. When their supply chains were cut off for two days by the bombardment, the men were forced to make do with a potato a day.

They spend most days and nights in trenches dug into the forest on the edges of Toshkivka or inside the basements of abandoned houses. ‚ÄúThey have no water, nothing there,‚Äù Lapko said. ‚ÄúOnly water that I bring them every other day.‚Äù

It‚Äôs a miracle the Russians haven‚Äôt pushed through their defensive line in Toshkivka, Khrus said as Lapko nodded.

the week, TODAY

Are Russia's gains in eastern Ukraine turning the tide of its war?

Russia appears to have significantly scaled back its immediate ambitions in Ukraine, throwing the bulk of its remaining military might at a handful of cities in the eastern Donbas region. And the Russians are making inroads.

Russia's forces are on the outskirts of Lyman, ""conducting an intense offensive"" to take control of the important rail hub in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine's Defense Ministry said. If they take Lyman, nearby Sloviansk is within shelling range, and the last Ukrainian strongholds in Luhansk Oblast ‚Äî Lysychansk and Severodonetsk ‚Äî are a big step closer to being encircled. The situation in Severodonetsk ""is serious,"" Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai said Wednesday. ""Our guys are holding on,"" but ""the city is constantly being shelled with every possible weapon in the enemy's possession.""

Ever since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, ""on almost every front, Russia has underachieved, while Ukraine has overachieved,"" NPR reports. But are Russia's scorched-earth advances in the Donbas a sign that the tide of war has shifted in its favor?

Ukraine may be in trouble
Russia's recent gains in the Donbas ""offer a sobering check on expectations for the near term,"" writes Michael Kofman, a Russia expert at the Center for a New American Security. The breakthrough at Popsana and nascent encirclement of Lyman threat to cut off Sevorodonetsk and Lysychansk from reinforcements and supply lines, and the fact that Russia is making these advances, ""despite a relatively weak military advantage, suggest that Ukrainian forces have suffered significant attrition.""",59ae52ecfa0fc892b7c321d807d8819ccac152d2,True,False,,,,,0,1653708164,,0,{},ia9v7kp,False,t3_uz9hwd,False,True,t1_ia9rocm,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/uz9hwd/russia_is_likely_to_lose_the_majority_of_its/ia9v7kp/,1653708179,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1653679364.0
