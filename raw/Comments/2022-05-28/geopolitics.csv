I'm not sure. Either way it's probably leading to massive inflation in everything except fuel and some foodstuffs.

What is Russia's inflation rate? In April it was18%, now [its estimated to drop to 5-7% next year.](https://www.ft.com/content/22bd612b-c5d9-4f8f-98b8-5f5b69a1da37)  Russia produces two things that matter most to people energy and food. During the Soviet Union, they were short of the latter (ie food), but not anymore. As for energy, they don't have to use it to subsidize East Europe (cheap energy) like the Soviets did.

Right now the black market rate is 15-20% higher than the official rate. Let's take the black market rate is the real rate, how is that any different than before the invasion? The official rate now is 65, at one point it dropped to 50. The exchange rate before the invasion was 75-80.

[Putin Sets Russians on Wild Hunt for Dollars in Black Market](https://archive.ph/TRVV5)

There are negative consequences of the ruble being too high as it is now.  It means the Russian government has less money to cover its revenue shortfalls.  If you depended on US$1=80 before, and now it's US$1=60, you don't, that will impact your deficit.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Oil flows and capital controls have warped the official rate, and the ruble is around 20% weaker at exchange points and on the black market -- reminding many Russians of its Soviet predecessor.

How different are Russia's capital controls now from China's current capital controls? A bit more stringent, but Russia's current controls are that much different from China in the 1980-1990s. Ruble trading volumes are 30-40% lower in Nov-Dec last year.

This is the most important point.

&gt;Even the Bank of Russia admitted in its latest monetary report that sanctions have essentially turned the rate into a blunt expression of the country’s trade balance.

&gt;  
&gt;As an embargo on oil and gas by European governments kicks in by late 2022, Ghose predicts the ruble will slump 10% by year-end and a further 20% by the end of 2023

At the end of the day, it is all about the trade balance. That is how the world really works. Yes, in normal situations a country can sustain a current account deficit for a couple of years, but in the end,  if they don't have a positive capital account to balance it out, they will slowly eat up F/X.

[],False,,KingRickie,,,[],,,,text,t2_6i5rvbgg,False,False,"How in depth should I get into my point of view? I’ll try to be concise but I will lose some of the nuance to my opinion. Russias motivations are incredibly complex, I don’t want to suggest they are doing this solely or even primarily because they want to destroy Ukrainian culture. I assume Russia’s goals are more political and economical than cultural, but to achieve their political goals they will need to diminish resistance from Ukraine. The kremlin has already been using lots of anti Ukrainian rhetoric in their justifications, even since the start of the war. Putin has argued that Ukraine is not a real country and has only existed for a few hundred years, that it belongs to Russia and is inherently Russian. They have been interfering in Ukrainian politics for decades now, suppressing the Ukrainian people. Also, the official war goal is to “denazify Ukraine” but since Ukraine is not inherently Nazi they can use this justification wherever they want to suppress the political will of Ukraine. I argue that forcefully blocking the democracy of a country is an assault on the people and culture of said country. 

If one assumes that Russia is actively trying to undermine, suppress, or weaken the culture of Ukraine, and then one combines this with the fact they are also physically destroying the territory and infrastructure of Ukraine, then I feel it can be argued that Russia is using genocide to support their goals in Ukraine. Since we don’t know the true objectives of Russia it’s hard to know what they are attempting to do. If Russia wanted to turn Ukraine into a puppet then we can assume they would also want to suppress individualism and Ukrainian culture, as they have done in the past.

But these Republics don't have to gain outright independence to do much harm. This possible harm would be far more than just human lives. It's very much possible that Russia can be fractured not territorially but geographically.

The fundamental basis of Russian infrastructure which holds the country together is its railways. Its national railway system is what transports goods and people across the federation and it's even the base of Russian military logistics. So from this, we can argue that the Trans Siberian Railway is arguably the MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF INFRASTRUCTURE IN ALL OF RUSSIA. This Importance of this railway is impossible to overstate. Russia's geography is very much harsh and if it wasn't for that single piece of rails then Russia could very well be divided East and West. It's the tape that holds Russia together.

If you look at a railway, religious, ethnic, and territorial map of Russia then it'd quickly become apparent that there's a vulnerability in the railway, and it's in the Republic of Tatarstan. The railway moves straight through Kazan, Tatarstan. Tatarstan is made up of majority Muslim Tatars, and so by definition, Orthodox Russians are in the minority. So if there was a massive surge of discontent and nationalism among the Tatar population then you can see how this is a serious threat to Russian infrastructure. I'll say it again since it's so important: the trans-Siberian railway is CRITICAL to Russia.

And this vulnerability is recognized by the Kremlin as well. You've likely heard of Ukrainians being repatriated to Russia in the millions but do you have any idea of where they're being sent? Well, the majority have been sent to where else but Tatarstan.

 Pakistan was no different from any other country in the world in that there was significant contingents in the country's various autonomous/rogue agencies that took advantage of the instability to war profiteer.

1- population collapse will reduce growth increase cost of healthcare and cause  economic contraction. In 2040 , china population will be half what it is now . Due to femicide ( having a male child is more important ) , you have so 80-90 million more men then women . These guys out of a job and a partner are going to be a major source of problem and friction for china .

2- china cannot project any power or import any ressources vital for it's economy without US global systems or Protection of US navy . This is ending now with deglobalisation . China was never able to pass the first island chain withput US .US is withdrawing support to global system and without it china cannot survive as a unified entity at the end of the decade .

3- CCP is becoming more totalitarian and centralized . Meaning no check and balance on any abuse or corruption . Xi have Literally shot the messenger so many times nobody whant to give him news unless specifically order too because if it is different of what is in Xi head the messenger can loose his head . So you have central government unable to rule correctly or know even what is going on.

4- the economy was biuld in aim of maximun employement and not profitability or sustainability.  You had massive projects like high speed trains and massive estate projects that litterally crimpled the budget and bankrupted entire cities . 

5- the chinese vaccine barely worked on first iteration of the corona virus and they can't import western ones because they spent a lot efforts to downplay their effectiveness . So the only course for chinese authorities is shutdowns of entires cities . It doesn't work because this is one of the most contagious virus in the world and chinese authorities keep hitting their head on the wall.

There is no insurgency issue in the cities on the Moroccan side. I have been to both Dakhla many times and Laayoune once or twice and they are very safe and well developed. Dakhla is very beautiful and touristy and kitesurfing is very big there. In fact, the Dakhla region has one of the best GDPs per capita in Morocco thanks to tourism investments (and it’s relatively small population plays a factor of course). 


All Morocco asks for is recognization over its sovereignty.

We would have Islamist insurgents in the desert, and an unfriendly state to boot. 


Contrarily to popular belief, the phosphate in the region contributes to only a minority of exports. The main deposits are in Khouribga. Morocco operates in a deficit in those regions, even bottled water is heavily subsidized in order to offer clean drinking water. We are strongly investing in desalination there.


The people in those provinces enjoy a high standard of living when you relate it to the rest of Africa and especially when compared to other countries in the Sahara.


When it comes to Spain, we tend to have a good outlook when it comes to our #1 trading partner. Yes, #1 in trade. The Sahara policy is what we disagree with and historically Spain has been hostile when it comes to it.

I think Biden is pivoting towards the QUAD because with exception of Singapore the ASEAN community don't want to be perceived to close to China. America can engage Philippines, because as the most democratic among them is the more influenceable. 

IMO ASEAN will be the reason that India will take so much time to catch up with China, as the competence is fierce. Indonesia and Vietnam are my bets too, and it is interesting to learn more about it.

\---

About the points mentioned. I agree that some of the problems stated were there before Xi, but Xi make them worst. For instance, Korean and Japan have not really liked China, not even because rivalry, but because historical and racial reasons too. But when it came to business they loved China: Korea and Japan capital were probably as relevant for China's industrialization as it was the American market. After the controversy with THAAD Samsung moved its manufacturing for exporting facilities to India. The same with Japan after disagreements with a judicial decision in the mainland, both under Xi. Thanks to that, for these countries, China is no longer a trusted commercial partner.

I am hesitant to call what is happening a genocide but the current oppression policy on Uyghurs is a direct result of XI involvement (he is the one that installed the concentration camps), even if before there were separatist movements and even terrorist attacks, how China is dealing with it it's the real problem. I think Europe will have sympathized with the China position given their own relation with Islamism driven attacks, especially in France and Spain and Italy. But putting people in concentration camps is not good, and now everybody, rightfully so, see China as a totally bad guy, and 99 % of the world population don't even know of the previous situation in part because of how China has handled the issue.

[],False,,TrinityAlpsTraverse,,,[],,,,text,t2_7q6sqy,False,False,"I know it's a controversial point of discussion because people have been predicting the economic slow down of China for decades, but I think when you look at the economic fundamentals of China they have some structural issues no matter who is in charge. 

China followed a well established growth model of mainly government directed supply side driven growth. They also have had great timing. During a time of (relative) global stability where companies were looking to outsource labor to cheaper countries, China provided a large, young and inexpensive workforce that thanks to the one child policy had more time to devote to productive work since there were fewer children to raise. 

This led to consistent and extensive growth over and raised the standard of living for Millions of people in China. A huge accomplishment. 

Before the early 2000's China's growth was mostly driven by filling a clear need in the international system. Since then, they still fill that need, but their growth has been shifted toward less productive investments. This is seen in the massive rise in their total debt to GDP during the last twenty years. At some point, like every country that experiences that rapid of a rise in total debt, there will be an adjustment period. 

The real issue in China is a consumption and savings issue. China is a large consumer market due to having a large population, but compared to other large economies the savings to consumption ratio is balanced heavily towards savings, which means they have excess production which they export to other countries. Which is seen in their consistent trade surpluses. 

This works if global consumption is rising, but I think that is no longer a guaranteed. We are now entering an era of the global economy where wealthy countries are rapidly getting older.  Consumption is mainly driven by the young-- they buy houses, cars, have kids and consume more than they save. If global consumption flatlines, growth through exporting a larger a larger amount of excess production is no longer an option. 

That leaves China with trying to grow through increased domestic consumption. While they've made a lot of noise recently about shifting to this model of growth, it is complicated by two reasons. China has an aging population and the future of China is fewer and fewer young people, which means fewer consumers. With that being said, they still have a huge population and could grow consumption through income redistribution to poorer Chinese workers, which would lead to more consumption as poorer individuals consume more as a percentage of their total income than the wealthy. But this bring up the second and large issue, such a redistribution would come at the expense of the large state corporations/entities and  politically connected and wealthy individuals. Such a redistribution would be incredibly disruptive, and the people in power would be unlikely to give up that economic power. And that's why I think it won't happen no matter who runs the CCP. 

We see this through China's policies to stimulate economic growth. They're by and large all supply side measures, mainly through loans provided by State Banks. Any demand side measure to promote consumption are generally too small to make a difference.

While China has the potential for huge consumption led growth the political reality is such that it's more likely that we'll see an extended Japan Style period of low growth when there debt load gets too high. And unfortunately, I don't think this is the result of Xi versus another leader. China has always emphasized Supply side growth (with good reason it worked really well for them in the past), and unfortunately for China the political headwinds against switching to more consumption based growth are probably too strong no matter who is the leader.",183a248743ec120702b9127afba8fb9f517fe10c,True,False,,,,,0,1653714244,,0,{},iaa4t0s,False,t3_uz1ejb,False,True,t3_uz1ejb,/r/geopolitics/comments/uz1ejb/why_xi_jinping_is_the_best_that_could_have/iaa4t0s/,1653714260,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1653685444.0
