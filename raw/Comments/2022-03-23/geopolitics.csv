2) Refugees can be and are returned to their home states, when admitted elsewhere. If they are given citizenship, they are no longer refugees. With Palestinians, they are the only population in the world that is granted refugee status even if they have citizenship elsewhere, and in perpetuity down the generations.

3) The far-right in Europe is complaining about small numbers of refugees. They're not facing down refugees that would literally double their population.

4) Europe isn't admitting people who want to create their own state. Palestinians do. So Europe is admitting people who want to be citizens of the state they're in, while Palestinians want to create their own state and destroy Israel, literally. There's a key difference between what the groups of immigrants are saying.

5) There is literally one Jewish state in the entire world. It is tiny. There are 20+ Arab states. There is already a majority-Palestinian state (Jordan). There are dozens of European states. No one is being overwhelmed, but you betcha no one is going to call for Europe to take in enough immigrants to be overwhelmed, and they themselves say so. That's not a ""far-right"" position. It's the position of all parties in government, because integrating millions of people is difficult. No different for Israel, which would face over 5 million Palestinian ""refugees"" (under a unique definition used nowhere else in the world for any other group), as a country of 9 million, with 5 million already in the West Bank and Gaza who would also all qualify to enter.

International sanctions =/= ""Sanctions"" in common usage. The word sanctions, particularly if you're a Hebrew speaker, means multiple things. Internationally applied sanctions are one version, sanctions as synonym for punishment are another.

I'm guessing you're not familiar with the language.

&gt;The Palestinian Authority is, in the context of being the recipient of sanctions, a state.

The Palestinian Authority is not a state, nor does Israel treat it as a state, nor is it sanctioning the Palestinian Authority's institutions in the same ways as countries it has trade relations with under international bodies.

You leave that out for some reason.

&gt;The bold bit is the only relevant part &amp; the article freely concedes that this can be changed. It's not a case of Israel being unable to use sanctions, it's a case of Israel not wanting to declare Russia their enemy - vastly different scenarios.

Israel wouldn't have to declare Russia their enemy, they'd have to **declare war on Russia**. The definition of ""enemy"" under Israeli law is set by a [British Mandate law](https://www.adalah.org/uploads/oldfiles/Public/files/Discriminatory-Laws-Database/English/17-Trade-with-the-Enemy-Ordinance-1939.pdf) that defined enemy states as states at war with Israel. The [Hebrew version](https://www.adalah.org/uploads/oldfiles/Public/files/Discriminatory-Laws-Database/Hebrew/17-Trade-with-the-Enemy-Ordinance-1939.pdf) uses the same language.

&gt;I'm hardly a UN expert but that seems like a truly psychotic reading of that document

Insults are pointless.

&gt;it doesn't even include the word ""return"", it's literally about the living conditions of refugees, and the only thing called for is more funding for the agency.

Evidently you didn't read:

&gt;Notes with regret that repatriation or compensation of the refugees, as
provided for in paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 194 (III), has not yet
been effected

That's a call for ""repatriation"", i.e. return. They didn't use the word ""return"", they used a synonym. Same effect.

Holocaust denial isn't just denying it happened. It's also the denial of any culpability by those responsible. That's why I referred to ""soft Holocaust denial"". He said:

&gt;Ukrainians made their choice 80 years ago. We saved Jews and that’s why there are Righteous Gentiles among us

This is a rewriting of history to ignore the culpability of Ukrainians in the Holocaust. That's soft Holocaust denial. Holocaust experts have pointed this out. He also drew a comparison between Russia's war and the Holocaust, which is also frankly soft denial by comparing something far less bad (even if it is awful) to the Holocaust. That's just ridiculous.

Russia's war is bad. You don't have to diminish the Holocaust by comparison. More Jews died in the Holocaust *per day* than all Ukrainian civilians in the past month tallied so far, to say nothing of Roma and other targeted groups not normally counted in the Holocaust but still targeted for genocide.

[1.5 million Jews](https://www.ushmm.org/m/pdfs/20130500-holocaust-in-ukraine.pdf) were killed in Ukraine, shot to death at close range. 1 in every 4 victims. That's an excellent monograph. The prevailing tendency was indifference among Ukrainians. Fair enough, it may not be ""most"". That's unclear, though, and the overarching point is that Ukrainians did widely participate. Police joined the Nazis in hunting down Jews. Villagers turned in Jews. And whatever collaboration happened was covered up and destroyed by the Soviets, to pretend there was little that happened there, as the monograph notes.

Ukraine can't claim it helped Jews and ignore the far more common collaboration and participation in the Holocaust.",9d8a07a6a3fb2c1b60b6b972746a98dae7e8f03d,True,False,,,,,0,1648078378,,0,{},i1v4076,False,t3_tks1ox,False,True,t1_i1unhwb,/r/geopolitics/comments/tks1ox/opinion_israels_semineutrality_on_ukraine_cant/i1v4076/,1648078391,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648049578.0,

But there's a gloomy feeling that I'm not seeing expressed much either in articles (and I'm talking FP, FA, and things like WaPo, not just CNN or the like) and especially not in the comments on Reddit. But...

I have a feeling the West may have seriously harmed its future power. By releasing such monumental sanctions, I don't see how the majority of the world continues to invest in reserves or use the petrodollar as before. It's going to look way too risky for them.

Another worry: I see a social trend of how the people of Rus should all collectively ""suffer"" economically since Ukrainians are. Of course, Rus is way less financially secure than the US or EU, so sanctions are easier to add whereas these types of sanctions on the West would either be impossible or incredibly detrimental for another country to impose. But I'm seeing a strange cultural shift in how war is perceived, and politically on how to combat it, that I think is due to this being a truly ""online"" war and also in a European country.

You do realize that I never said word one about a death, right? That was the last in a string of examples showing violence against law enforcement on the part of insurrectionists. The intent was not to clutch pearls over how anti-democratic their actions were, or whatever, but to demonstrate through multiple separate incidents that they used violence in an attempt to achieve their stated goal.
Either way, responsible for Sicknick's death or not, it sure is interesting that the side of the spectrum that likes to bang on about thin blue lines and obeying police and whatnot was all too happy with assaulting them at the Capitol. 

&gt; That's adorable

That's not a rebuttal to applying your logic consistently across multiple other instances. Is this an admission that your logic is flawed? 

&gt; When (for example) a Minneapolis Police precinct house is burned down, or a Seattle Police precinct house is taken over as part of CHAZ (complete with new signage) for a month and the city Department of Transportation installs concrete barriers to demarcate CHAZ territory from civilization, yes, I'd call that ""sanctioned by police"". Feel free to read this New York Times article from two months after the end of CHAZ and disagree.

You seem to have lost the plot. The issue at hand is the Capitol. You assert that the failure of cops to gun down (mostly) unarmed civilians represents a tacit endorsement of their behavior. This doesn't survive scrutiny; if this were the case, there wouldn't have been multiple clashes between insurrectionists and cops in and around the Capitol.

So why, exactly, do you continue to repeat the misinformation about people being ""invited"" into the Capitol, considering the coverage of riotous behavior, assaults on cops, and 700+ arrests and who knows how many convictions/plea deals since this supposed ""invitation""? 

&gt; Ah yes, ""dogwhistle"". The last resort of the intellectually desperate who can't come up with a valid riposte to an argument, so instead insinuates all sorts of negative connotations instead.

Of course it's a dogwhistle. You're specifically choosing to tie a word with negative connotations (riot) to a broader social movement where activities that fall under that specific definition are in the minority. You're trying to denigrate the protests by linking them to riots and equating them. You're using the sorts of phrasing that I expect from someone who opposes a more just world. 

&gt; In any case, what kind of Redditard gibberish is this? Wikipedia's article on the whole thing is called ""George Floyd protests"", and ""George Floyd riots"" redirects to said page. Is calling the 1992 riots in Los Angeles ""Rodney King riots"" a ""dogwhistle"", too?

You seem to not understand how Wikipedia works. That's adorable. See, when an article is created, it has to get a title. The first page went up on 29 May 2020, back when it *was* just the ""George Floyd Protests."" And you can actually look at the log and see the comment explaining why the thread was created: ""Riots warrant a separate article from the death of George Floyd"". Considering the initial content was split off of George Floyd's page, and the scale of subsequent protests was unknown, of course it's called that. And because of how wikipedia and the internet work, that initial name can't realistically be changed. 

Which is the subtitle of the page is now ""Part of the 2020–2022 United States racial unrest and the Black Lives Matter movement.""",74dc152beea6409014498775ce3bdfe783274b15,True,False,,,,,0,1648074598,,0,{},i1uuztx,False,t3_tkg5gf,False,True,t1_i1uijq4,/r/geopolitics/comments/tkg5gf/who_has_more_autonomy_canadian_provinces_american/i1uuztx/,1648074612,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648045798.0,

I think if a country *unilaterally invades another one using denazification as an excuse*, then yes Israel has an obligation to speak up one way or the other. If you think that is controversial, you're entitled to your opinion and that's all I'll say.

I did, and you know what? It left a really sour taste in my mouth. Zelensky, a Jewish president of Ukraine whose family suffered at the hands of the Germans in WWII, being accused of 'rewriting history' in a bid to gain Israeli sympathy *while being invaded on a denazification campaign* is the sort of ultra-cynical take that I can't make up even if I tried.

I do. Israel's size and effect on the conflict are not a reason for its stance; as I have said, other countries that have even less at stake have 'shown hands'.

The following are four ways that this has been done historically. 


1. Though a peace agreement/constitutional amendment to disband the military, restrictions on type of weapons allowed, or maximum number of military personnel authorized. 


Examples: Japan 1946 and Costs Rica 1948. 


2. Through permanent loss of population and land (natural resources).

The ability of a country to field and equip a military is in a large parte determined by its population size and its economic prosperity. 


In the last month Ukraine has lost 8% of its population. Usually the brightest, most successful leave first which causes damage lasting for a generation. If Ukraine loses the Kherson, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, and Lugansk oblasts to Russia it'll lose another 22% of its remaining population. If it loses access to the Black Sea, where 70% of its imports and exports pass through, it will be significantly hobbled economically. 


3. Air superiority (not permanent but effective as long as air superiority or the ability to strike continues).


Examples: 2012 and after, Israeli bombings on any ""game changing"" or advanced weapons shipments to Hezbollah from Iran. 2003 US's no fly zones in Iraq and subsequent bombings of Iraqi military equipment in those zones deamed to be a threat.

Kissinger saw an opportunity to take Egypt out of the Soviet sphere of influence and within about a decade he did just that, using Israel as fulcrum.

&gt;sanctions on assets and citizens of a state **that is not defined by law as an enemy country**

The bold bit is the only relevant part &amp; the article freely concedes that this can be changed. It's not a case of Israel being unable to use sanctions, it's a case of Israel not wanting to declare Russia their enemy - vastly different scenarios.

I'm hardly a UN expert but that seems like a truly psychotic reading of that document - it doesn't even include the word ""return"", it's literally about the living conditions of refugees, and the only thing called for is more funding for the agency.

It feels like the liberal foreign policy establishment forces are using the Ukraine crisis to score points against the Israel and weaken support for Israel's right to exist.  There have been so much misleading BS out there about Israel on Ukraine.  I will just highlight three examples:

1. **Bennett told Zelensky to surrender.**  This was denied by both Bennett's people and Zelensky's people.  I believe that there are two groups within the Ukrainian government and that the hardliners led by the FM and the Ukrainian Ambassador were the ones that leaked this hit against Bennett.  It was especially nasty because it was done right before Shabbat after Bennett, an Orthodox Jew, would have been disconnected and unable to respond.  It was meant to push that Israeli mediation was bad and that any negotiated solution would be surrender.  (Incidentally, I think that a negotiated solution is the best outcome - even one that lets Putin off the hook to some extent - because NATO refuses to put boots on the ground.)
2. **Israel refused to give Ukraine the Iron Dome.**  The Iron Dome wouldn't protect Ukraine.  It's designed for a particular Israeli problem - crude missiles shot from Gaza and Lebanon.  It wouldn't protect against cruise missiles and guided munitions dropped from airplanes.  What Ukraine needs are advanced air support and airplanes.
3. **Israel refused to give Ukraine Pegasus software.**  This is the newest entry into the ""We Hate Israel"" file and is probably most hypocritical.  The story is meant to suggest that this happened recently when that is impossible because the US sanctioned NSO and the Israeli government cut ties with the company.  It was in 2018/2019 before anyone thought that Putin would be stupid enough to invade Ukraine, which doesn't make it any worse than Germany looking out for its own interests at that time.  Moreover, the NY Times and others were critical of Israel for selling it and pointed out it was mostly employed against opposition politicians, critical journalists, human rights activists, etc.  But now these same people are complaining that the software they wanted banned wasn't shared with Ukraine.

&gt; Given all this, Foreign Policy says, the West needs to dramatically strengthen its posture and infrastructure in and around the Suwalki region. The first step, it posits, should be NATO’s assertion that it will no longer be subject to the Founding Act as a result of Russia’s unilateral abrogation.

&gt; One of the guests on 60 Minut, Russia’s top-rated politics talk show, last week presented a detailed plan demonstrating how Russian forces could attack NATO Baltic states and go on to attack neutral Sweden. Colonel Igor Korotchenko, formerly of the Russian General Staff and air force and currently a reserve officer, pointed at a map showing Russian forces pushing up from Kaliningrad — and blocking NATO reinforcements by closing the Suwalki Corridor.

&gt; “It tests the abilities of the Russian and Belarusian armed forces to mobilize, generate forces, deploy, maintain their forces in the field, and conduct operations across the entire spectrum of conventional warfare,” it states. “From the Russian perspective, Zapad also seeks to integrate the Belarusian armed forces.”

&gt; In 2017, for the first time, NATO also held an exercise focusing on defence of the gap from a possible Russian attack.

**A 100-km strip of land between Kaliningrad and Belarus, if seized, could determine the fate of three small countries**

&gt; Since their independence, the Baltic NATO states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have existed in a constant state of vulnerability to assault, due to shared and often snarled borders with Russia and Belarus.

&gt; And now, nerves are once again wrought, as the Baltic countries could effectively be cut off from the rest of Europe were the Russians to seize the Suwalki Corridor, a 40-kilometre stretch of Polish territory along the Lithuania border. This ribbon of road and farmland connects Belarus and the highly militarized Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, on the Baltic Sea.

&gt; With Russian President Vladimir Putin’s desire to retake certain former Soviet territories, the Baltic states could be his next target — should his military still have the ability to stretch itself westward with any might. In order to encircle the three small countries, he would want to take the Suwalki Gap, as it’s also known. These three nations, with a combined population of some six million people, have this single overland link to the alliance’s main territory. Warsaw has warned previously about its vulnerability.

&gt; But what exactly is it and why is it strategically important to the Baltics?

&gt; The corridor is a 100-kilometre-long ribbon of tough-to-defend flat, ancient farmland that contains, for the most part, just two multi-lane roads and a rail line.

&gt; Foreign Policy suggests the Suwalki Gap “is familiar to military strategists but often overlooked by most policymakers and the general public.”

&gt; But Russia certainly has eyes on it.

&gt; “During last year’s Zapad military exercise,” John R. Deni, a research professor at the U.S. Army War College’s Strategic Studies Institute, wrote in Foreign Policy last December, “Russian and Belarusian troops reportedly practised closing the Suwalki corridor by attacking from Belarus in the direction of Kaliningrad.”",4652ce3fdf8eefbc9b6d7f8bfe038517f3a98e99,True,False,,,,,0,1648064778,,0,{},i1u5tj9,True,t3_tla8jb,False,True,t3_tla8jb,/r/geopolitics/comments/tla8jb/how_the_littleknown_suwalki_corridor_could/i1u5tj9/,1648064796,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648035978.0,

An interesting article on the small strategic stretch of flat land between Poland and Lithuania connecting NATO with the Baltics. With the recent aggression of Russia in Ukraine, and Putin's ambitions to reclaim the lost Soviet territories, there is a high likelihood that in the event that Russia (and potentially Belarus) prepare to engage NATO militarily, that Suwalki Corridor will be a crucial flashpoint of combat. As the article mentions, in 2017, for the first time, NATO  held military exercises focusing on defence of the gap from a possible Russian attack.

Not to mention it takes months to train people competent to actually work on the system. Everyone with any familiarity with the system [knows that it's not useful](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/explained-why-israel-s-iron-dome-won-t-really-help-ukraine-against-russia-1.10690475) against Russia. It wouldn't stop the artillery Russia is using, wouldn't help with the jets, and Russia has hypersonic missiles capable of destroying the largely immobile batteries.

It's nonsense. Not to mention exports require the US signing off since it's a joint project, and the US doesn't want to supply advanced air defense to Ukraine either, because it thinks it'll get stolen by Russia. From the article, some choice quotes:

&gt;The president's comments aside, Tal Inbar, a senior research fellow at the U.S.-based Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, believes that while the system could likely intercept some Russian munitions, such as Grad rockets, the large land mass of Ukraine and the variety of Russia's projectiles means that exporting Iron Dome batteries “is more of a theoretical question and wishful thinking by Ukraine” than a practical solution.

&gt;“The larger the country is, you need a much larger number of radars and interceptors. Israeli is a small country, in that regard it’s an advantage to missile defense. That’s not the case in Ukraine,” he said, noting that Saudi forces, with their more advanced missile defense capabilities, are still struggling to prevent Houthi strikes because of the large territory they have to defend.

&gt;“When speaking of ballistic missiles like Iskander that the Russians are using, Iron Dome is not the solution for this,” Inbar said. It’s designed to be used “against rockets and UAVs, but not ballistic missiles.”

&gt;Beyond the technological limitations, there would also be logistical difficulties to providing Ukraine with Iron Dome, Inbar told Haaretz, explaining that the “implementation of such a system is complex and a long process, so even if Israel was willing … the time to make it operational is not so short.”

&gt;Beyond that, the Israel Defense Forces has a limited supply of interceptors, with the U.S. Congress only recently approving a $1 billion allocation for Israel to replenish the missiles it expended in shooting down Hamas rockets during last summer’s fighting.

&gt;“So it is a little bit naive [to think] that Israel could supply other countries with a sufficient amount of interceptors,” Inbar said. “It’s not practical.”

Because Israel is not an American vassal state and can make its own foreign policy decisions. Israel gets so much funding for two reasons 1) it was part of the peace negotiations with Egypt, Egypt also receives a significant amount of money from the US for this purpose. 2) Israeli and American interests are heavily aligned and thus it is very beneficial for the US to see Israel succeed militarily. Those interests largely include seeing an Arab world that is divided and politically unstable. Lobbying may be the reason why Israel is able to maintain it at such a high level but it is certainly not the cause of it being so high.

Comparisons to “Palestine” are likewise misplaced. Russia seeks to destroy Ukraine. Palestinians seek to destroy Israel. Even Zelensky has noted the comparison is to Israel, not to Palestinians.

Finally, and importantly, you linked but didn’t mention why Zelensky’s speech was controversial in Israel compared to elsewhere. The reason is simple: Zelensky engaged in soft Holocaust denial. He talked about how Ukraine “saved Jews”, ignoring that most Ukrainians enthusiastically joined antisemitic pogroms for decades, and enthusiastically participated and benefited from the expulsions and murders of Jews by Germany. This is obviously controversial, and while Ukraine is on the right side of history, Zelensky’s speech has been rightly criticized.

Notably, Israelis are also wondering why Israel is expected to do *more*, when they’ve already done more than any other Middle Eastern ally of the West, including more than most countries worldwide. Under Zelensky, Ukraine has voted for numerous anti-Israel resolutions at the UN that effectively call for Israel’s destruction and has not opposed the Iran deal that Israel views as an existential threat.

Certainly, but state autonomy is not really a political issue for us these days, not in the way it was 150 years ago. It's still a popular political ideal, but it's not normative for folks to have allegiance first to their state, and then to their country.

e.g., Californians identify as Americans, and *then* as Californians. They are much more engaged in the presidential race than in the California gubernatorial race, and voter turnout for state elections is much lower than for national elections.

The major partisan divide isn't geographic anymore, except coincidentally; it's straightforwardly two party, right wing / left wing.

State autonomy is used as a dog whistle for the former group; when conservatives make arguments based on state autonomy, it's the state's autonomy to enforce conservative social values that are not enforced federally. When liberals make arguments based on state autonomy, it's typically the state's autonomy to buck federal social values that are conservative.

e.g., the same conservative senator will stump for ""State's Rights"" to enforce a ban on mask mandates by private institutions, and will vehemently oppose a ""State's Rights"" defense of marijuana legalization in a neighboring state.",3c0b104eed370884332802323779d38ff73bde6a,True,False,,,,,0,1648042367,,0,{},i1sjmzy,False,t3_tkg5gf,False,True,t1_i1sipns,/r/geopolitics/comments/tkg5gf/who_has_more_autonomy_canadian_provinces_american/i1sjmzy/,1648042379,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648013567.0,

Technically, that's (almost) exactly what the US is. The US is a federation of states, and most other federations have been based on the US model (additional states can be admitted, their rights to self government and autonomy are constitutionally protected, etc).

The federal government's power has grown over time in the US, gradually reducing the extent to which it ""depends on the state"", but compared to most countries in Europe, Africa or Asia, the extent of local autonomy is radically higher, and the federal government attempting to abolish self government in each of the states would be unthinkable.

That's grossly oversimplifying *Reference Re Secession of Quebec*. Quebec nationalists liked the outcome because it found that The Rest of Canada *must* after a successful and valid independence referendum, negotiate with Quebec (or any province) to help make it happen.

Further, while the court found that a unilateral declaration of independence is not legal (or, more accurately, insufficient), it also found that the question of secession is a political question, not a legal one.

For why, this is important, think back to the 1995 referendum. It's now known that had the Yes side won, Parizeau would have issued a UDI almost immediately. At that point, whether a UDI is legal/sufficient is immaterial; what matters is whether the government and people of Quebec believe and act as if it is, and whether Ottawa will use physical force to prevent such an interpretation. No one really believed in 1995 that the federal government would use the military to prevent secession. At that point international diplomatic recognition is what counts; France and the Francosphere would have quickly recognized Quebec as a sovereign country (quite possibly the same day as any UDi), and that would be enough to persuade the rest of the world over time. Ottawa, London, and Washington would have come around eventually.

If an independence referendum wins in Quebec or any other province, the court has given tacit clearance for that province's government to, if TROC refuses to cooperate, unilaterally declare independence. We might see such a referendum passing in Alberta in, say, 2028; Ottawa and the other provinces (except Quebec, because even the most federalist government in Quebec City isn't going to set the precedent against such) refusing to cooperate in amending the Constitution; and the provincial government citing *Re Secession* to UDI. (Bonus points if you imagine a second Trump administration immediately recognizing Alberta's sovereignty. Even more bonus points if you imagine Edmonton and Washington also announcing the start of negotiations for US annexation.)

Bottom line: It's tough to read *Re Secession* as not a big win for Quebec or any other province's ability to secede from Canada.",42e1d49dc348406cbe56157d529b368d74b754d2,True,False,,,,,0,1648037291,,0,{},i1s9jgh,False,t3_tkg5gf,False,True,t1_i1qm302,/r/geopolitics/comments/tkg5gf/who_has_more_autonomy_canadian_provinces_american/i1s9jgh/,1648037302,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648008491.0,

1) It is important that the upper chamber is not just a secondary parliament with independent mandates but on a state level instead of voting districts.  
The representation of the voters is done by the House of Representatives (hence the name). The Senate while officially representing the states is by no means accountable to the state governments. Thus states have no direct power on the federal level.  
I just gave the US and Australia half a point for electing instead of appointing like Canada.

2) The federal government is more centralized today than it was intended in the constitution.  
This is possible by the federal gov. using the Commerce Clause as you said and federal grants and funds to enact legislation.  
While de jure the seperation is clear, the US de facto overreaches it's enumerated powers by a practice known as implied powers as well as aforementioned legal tricks like enacting a quasi-federal minimum drinking age of 21 via highway funds.  


To sum up the limitations are not clear, otherwise the numerous succesful and unsuccesful attempts wouldn't exist. 

3) Vertical implementation means that a federal law cannot be enacted on its own, but is  enacted via a state law. Combined with the power of states to vote and write on a federal law aswell as finally formulating it, the states have the maximum amount of power over federal law possible within the framework of a federation.Thus there is also no jurisdiction exclusive to the federal level, while there can be some exclusive to states.",3f9088c081a0a23bd11871a51f52db4530acc06c,True,False,,,,,0,1648036564,,0,{},i1s8acf,False,t3_tkg5gf,False,True,t1_i1rqzk6,/r/geopolitics/comments/tkg5gf/who_has_more_autonomy_canadian_provinces_american/i1s8acf/,1648036581,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648007764.0,

An opinion piece on how Israel is maintaining an increasingly uncomfortable neutral stance on Ukraine. While it joined in the UN vote to condemn Russia and supplied humanitarian aid to Ukraine, the reluctance to join in Western sanctions and cut ties make it a conspicuous outlier, especially when compared to others traditionally neutral states like Singapore and Switzerland.

Some reasons:

- As the author mentioned, Bennett is hoping to play peacemaker, and therefore cannot show partisanship.

- While willing to take in Ukrainian Jewish refugees, Israel also has to deal with [Russian Jewish oligarchs looking to seek safe haven](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/14/as-ukraine-war-rages-israel-grapples-with-fate-of-oligarchs). 

- Some have drawn [parallels between Ukraine and Palestine](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2022/3/6/what-the-war-in-ukraine-thought-us-palestinians).

- As stated in the piece, Russia is kingmaker in the Middle East with the winding down of US operations in the region and Israel cannot afford to jeopardise relations with its neighbours, which only normalised recently.

This discomfort was in full display in Zelensky's speech to the Knesset. [His attempt to appeal to lawmakers by invoking the Holocaust caused huge controversy](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-lawmakers-tear-into-zelensky-for-holocaust-comparisons-in-knesset-speech/), in contrast to the unanimous approval he received from other parliamentary bodies.",46d315f74ce47172388086e5ac5955d68337fce5,True,False,,,,,0,1648035979,,0,{},i1s7b6l,True,t3_tks1ox,False,True,t3_tks1ox,/r/geopolitics/comments/tks1ox/opinion_israels_semineutrality_on_ukraine_cant/i1s7b6l/,1648035994,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648007179.0,

Yeah basically.

Additionally, more practice than law, but the president only sends the military in domestically when requested for help by the governor. That’s why in 2020 during the George Floyd protests Trump freaked a lot of people out by militarizing Washington DC (there’s footage of helicopters flying very low over pedestrians).

Typical Trump Derangement Syndrome, where anything Trump did = ""FASCISM!!!1!!!!"". Eisenhower federalized the Arkansas National Guard *and* sent in the 101st Airborne to escort the Little Rock Nine to school, and that was obviously without Governor Faubus's approval. The situation during the nationwide rioting and looting was much worse than a crowd jeering/threatening children desegregating a school.",a26e313d1975e7a31c11de6fe1a921510b70cc74,True,False,,,,,0,1648034715,,0,{},i1s5ab8,False,t3_tkg5gf,False,True,t1_i1rnvci,/r/geopolitics/comments/tkg5gf/who_has_more_autonomy_canadian_provinces_american/i1s5ab8/,1648034731,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648005915.0,

But yes for sure the ""future"" is going to move else where being China's cost of labor is increasing, so the cheaper labor has to go elsewhere because as an example your not going to have say Japan and SKorea make tshirts with their wage minimums and high land tax. 

As for what companies that go there, I do know many East Asia companies/Countries (China/Taiwan/Japan/SKorea) are already in the ASEAN countries, so really it is still East Asia doing the investments, and lack of anything high tech (including buildings) in ASEAN does not help in building the required buildings/equipment (still East Asia doing the work for that end). [Side note: I think China is betting more on Africa than ASEAN, more land, cheaper labor, dont need to ship between islands for a long supply chain, not prone to typhoons every summer/fall]

It really differs state to state. Within a state, the state is ultimately supreme. It can abolish counties, cities, move internal borders, etc. How a state delegates power is ultimately up to it, so we have tons of different laws, but generally speaking, states devolve powers to counties and cities.  
Sometimes you have combined county/cities, and other times you have shared powers. I'm not familiar of any situation where a county has power over a city within it - although it may exist.  
Here in Texas I currently vote for separate Travis county and the city of austin governments, which are responsible for different things. Counties usually handle rural policing, elections, etc, while cities will handle their city cops, parks, infrastructure. But the state has ultimate power to override anything it wants (and the Texas state government does this all the time - such as overturning a plastic bag ban).",68e98f872b508152b9388de5a8336d563f864f61,True,False,,,,,0,1648023736,,0,{},i1rrj1r,False,t3_tkg5gf,False,True,t1_i1rdgoq,/r/geopolitics/comments/tkg5gf/who_has_more_autonomy_canadian_provinces_american/i1rrj1r/,1648023752,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647994936.0,

The US has **extremely clear** limitations on federal power.  In fact the whole point of the Constitution was to define what the federal government can do, and anything not listed is allocated to the states.

In practice this power has been extended b/c the fed can regulate ""interstate commerce"" which in today's economy means most economic activity.

I'm not sure I fully follow what you mean here, but state laws are completely separated from federal law.  States have exclusive jurisdiction over most areas, and feds are supreme within a very narrowly defined set of laws.  99% of crimes prosecuted in the US are at the state level.

Disclaimer: I know the most about Canada, followed by the US, and don't have a ton of familiarity with Australia so this might be completely off base. 

All three countries adhere to the democratic principle of separation of powers, meaning that the judiciary, legislature, and executive all have separate and independent powers and responsibilities. This is meant to prevent authoritarian rule. 

Judiciary = courts 
Legislature = Parliament (Can, Aus) or Congress (US) 
Executive = Prime Minister (Can, Aus) or President (US) 

The legislatures are split into the House of Representatives (US)/House of Commons (Canada) and the Senate. The Senate is the more powerful entity within the legislature. It reviews the legislation that emerges out its country's respective House. The Houses consist of elected representatives - Congresspeople or Members of Parliament. 

Unlike the US, Canada and Australia are Parliamentary systems which means that there is some overlap between the executive and the legislature (the House). The Prime Ministers in both of these countries participate in Parliamentary sessions as elected representatives of their respective ridings, and help formulate legislation. Unlike the US President they don't possess a presidential prerogative/veto power that can be used at will. Any legislation the PM wants to pass has to be voted on by the entire House of Commons to be enacted. 

In all of these systems, the legislature is widely considered to be the strongest branch due to its law making abilities. 

Now, looking at the federal units, you can see that each province or state has its own legislature. If you compare the American and Canadian constitutions, you'll see that the 1867 Canadian Constitution Acts split legislative powers between the Parliament of Canada and the Provincial Legislatures in sections 91 and 92. These lists are  **exhaustive.** If there is a conflict regarding whether an enacted law is outside the province/federal government's powers, anyone can ask the courts to review the statute and decide who has the authority to legislate on that matter according to the s.91 and 92 lists. 

In the American constitution, the division of legislative powers is **not exhaustive** and for me, what I find really striking, is that any power not explicitly granted by the constitution falls under the States' jurisdiction. That's more legislative power than Canadian provinces have! 

Finally, in comparing these subnational entities (provinces, states) and evaluating their power relative to one another, you can't neglect the economic component and the fact the US has a much larger population than either Canada or Australia. California's population alone is almost 40 million people, while the entire country of Canada's is 38 million people, and Australia's population is about 26 million. These larger numbers translate into larger economies. California again has a larger economy than either Canada or Australia. Even though not all states have GDP's and populations larger than Canada or Australia do, you have to remember we're comparing *provinces* of both of these countries. The most populous province in Canada is Ontario, which has 15 mil people, almost half of the total country. Larger populations/more money = more power. Although US states tend to tax less than Canadian provinces, the fact that their revenue bases are much larger allow them to raise a lot of money. US states have militias which Canadian provinces do not have and the mere fact of how large they are allows them to exert more power than Canadian states do (in the broadest sense of the term).

Yes, sort of - you can spend years in law school studying this stuff.

\- Taxation - states can definitely control their own tax codes, which is separate from the federal code.  

\- Health - so, this one is complex, but the federal government has the power to ""regulate interstate commerce"" and complex health care is almost by definition involving interstate transactions of some type or another, so the federal government has actually been able to regulate this quite a bit, but it is very legally contentious and always being litigated in court.  

\- Voting - yeah states have a lot of power here.  We don't have 1 presidential election - we have 51 on the same day (states plus DC).  The federal government can set some very broad guidelines based on the Constitution (such as no poll taxes, no disenfranchising people older than 18, or women, or race).  But overall states are very supreme here.  I believe states could lower the age to 10 if they wanted to and the feds couldn't do anything to stop them.

And my hunch is that Australia has the least independent states - particularly when compared to the USA, but like many on this thread I know very little about all three constitutions or real world workings - Canada particularly is mostly a haze to me. 

So how do we best compare? Quite tricky really. Financial independence? As others have stated in Australia most taxes are managed federally and the states traditionally come begging, but more recently property values have meant huge increases in state based revenue from state property tax when sold or land taxes. Military is complex because the military / police role divide is fairly murky across these jurisdictions - Law making ? I’d say state law in Australia is way easier to overturn by Commonwealth law if it contradicts than in the US.

[],False,,ColdEvenKeeled,,,[],,,,text,t2_3cpw5nga,False,False,"They are each (States and States and Provinces) fairly similar, but different. OP is correct in that Western Australia could lock it's borders, but that is because Australia does not have an equivalent Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which in Canada states something to the effect ""....everyone has freedom to travel anywhere in the country...."". Australia doesn't have that. So, it's not a power so much as an oversight (among many other out-of-date things in Australia). 

Where the real difference is in the power/authority of cities in each country. 

Cities really are the creatures of States in Australia with the State having larger staff and budgets - and Ministers with Authority to override Cities -  than Cities combined.  Cities are nominally the creatures of Provinces in Canada but the Provinces do not get involved in Transit or Land Use or Density or Urban Design matters at all  (unlike in Australia). In neither Canada or Australia are cities permitted to raise taxes or charges (except Vancouver as a Charter city) but for with permission by the State or Province. 
However, Cities in Canada have a higher allowance to take on debt than Australian cities, to thereby achieve things at a speed, quality/quantity they desire, from what I can glean. 

In the US it seems the City may be subservient to the County (i.e. Seattle and King County) on some matters (such as transit) but that the State mostly allows cities to manage their own affairs and raise or lower taxes and services as they see (vote) fit. 

But, I may have this all wrong.

There are trends within the various gradients of status quo, but the demographic trends are clear. Think of the green lines as moving or leaning toward independence, red ones toward unification and the blue and black ones as true status quo.

Status quo with movement toward independence is reflected in the electorate and in the 1999 revisions to the DPP charter stating that Taiwan is already independent while at the same time rejecting ""one China"" or any effort toward ""national unification"" in the ROC constitution. This should not be interpreted as being a purely status quo but a refocusing of independence efforts to where they are more meaningful which is in the country's own laws. Declaring independence from PRC makes little sense because ROC was never a part of PRC, but removing national unification from the ROC constitution would be a true ""declaration of independence"".

In 2005 under a DPP president, the National Assembly, whose building still stands in Nanjing (though is now called the Nanjing ""Great Hall of the People"") and at one point had nearly 3,000 seats from across China, was dissolved, the delegates from the Chinese mainland removed (some of which were vacant or being filled by Taiwanese), power to elect the president and VP transferred to the people of the free area (Taiwan and islands under ROC control) and perhaps most importantly, power to amend the constitution (and territory) transferred to the people as well. This is what you can call salami slicing toward putting a referendum in front of the people on territory and effectively ""declaring independence"".

And William Lai, a leader of the New Tide faction in DPP (pro-independence), who went to Fujian University in 2014 and told students there, in China, that it was part of their university's legacy to honor the student movement that led to Tiananmen Square as patriotic and also said that DPP's goal will always be true independence, is now the sitting vice president and a strong candidate for the next president of Taiwan.

Despite appearances from the outside, there is a lot of movement occurring within Taiwan, and the US (via the AIT) is well aware what's happening on the ground. At the showing of the Hong Kong film Revolution Of Our Times which was enormously successful in Taiwan and featured a whole host of speakers from young Taiwan independence circles and Hongkonger diaspora, rallies for Tsai Ing-wen in 2019-20 and other protests like anti-red media and same-sex marriage rights the past few years, the AIT director and staff is in attendance. The US wants to support the direction Taiwan is heading and just like it's mentioned elsewhere in the thread, Biden came out right away and said the US wasn't going to commit forces to Ukraine. The opposite was said about Taiwan.

As far as immigration and economy, [here is the trend on investment to China](https://www.moeaic.gov.tw/business_category.view?lang=en&amp;seq=3).

[This is what immigration trends look like coming from China](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1086968/taiwan-number-of-chinese-immigrants/). Taiwan is encouraging immigration from ASEAN while immigrants from China must be spouses of Taiwanese and cannot work at all in the public sector.

Another example of a lack of state rights is weed legalisation which places Australia below America, despite ""decriminalisation"" in the capital territory (not a state), the usual response to legalisation attempts in Victoria and south Australia is that the federal government won't let them. That, or our federal government is just that bad.

In Canada, provinces and states are allowed to tax each other and I'd suspect they would close their borders to each other if they were hostile... But they're not because for all the flaws of Canadian politics they're not embarrassing like Australian politics is becoming. For an Australian into politics, the liberal national coalition (LibNats) is beginning to feel like a south American (or at least Mediterranean) party with as much open, blatant corruption responded to with a machismo of ""so what? What are you going to do about it"". That's the only reason the federal government lets *some* states do as they please.
