The real question should be whether there's any path to victory for Putin.

In just 3 days he already managed to turn his own population and part of his own cabinet (one of his advisors said in an interview he was advised against invading and did it despite opposition from many of his cabinet members) against him, unite NATO and other countries against him, caused a barrage of sanctions against Russia, including swift ban (which will most definitely cost him the support of many oligarchs). To top it all off, his army is now effectively fighting an enemy soon to be way better equipped than he anticipated, while his troops can't even get fuel supplies reliably.

Wind/solar, definitely.  The other thing will be utility-scale battery storage.  I believe there is not much of this in the EU right now, I know there was at least one project in the UK but in the USA, there are multiple 1MW+ facilities operating for a couple years now.  I believe the biggest is about 200MW x 6hrs.  That's big.  One simple-cycle gas turbine would probably be comparable.  A combined cycle gas unit (say 2x1 gas/steam) would be ~500MW.

The problem when you add wind and solar to an electric grid, neither one is physically synchronized to the grid frequency (in the EU, 50Hz).  Unit's that physically spin, e.g. generators and the  turbines the turn them, always spin at a multiple of this frequency.  This is imperative because it creates what is called ""megavar"" or inertia in the system.  Basically if demand starts to overwhelm supply, the fact that this inertia exists gives a few seconds to 'buffer' and that makes a huge difference when a greater proportion of your power is coming from non-sync inverter-based resources like wind/solar.  Because of this factor, without large-scale storage solutions,  physically spinning, non-weather-dependent generation needs to be ~30% of the supply minimum.  In the USA, we have times in certain areas where the wind has to be curtailed (they literally have brakes on the wind turbines) because the system var is too low to let any more share be taken by wind.  Believe it or not, in the USA, Texas alone has more wind than every country in the EU except Germany.

in terms of nukes, Germany has 6 still operating and they had wanted to shut them down.  In 2020, those plants supplied almost 18% of total German electricity, yet they shut 3 of them down at the end of last year and are planning to shut the other 3 the end of 2022.  I imagine those plans are being reconsidered.

The plan seemed to be to make up for the nukes with a bunch more renewables and a little more gas, which would have been feed by Nord Stream 2.  Currently there is not enough LNG re-gas capacity in the EU for the continent to import enough gas.  This is exacerbated by the fact Europeans have let their storage levels get very low, largely driven by closures of gas-producing fields in the EU.

Germany still has a lot of lignite and other coal available, which while dirty (from a NOx and SOx perspective, ignoring carbon) would give them fuel independence since Germany has plenty of lignite.",3e4548e005a53aa7340309440dc09f4b4d4b9d1c,True,False,,,,,0,1645915684,,0,{},hyklhk2,False,t3_t16n5p,False,True,t1_hyk70de,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t16n5p/russia_really_has_only_12bln_in_liquid_foreign/hyklhk2/,1645915705,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1645886884.0,

2. The path to victory for Ukraine is just to make this war difficult. As costly economically and militarily as possible. If they can hold on to all their cities that's a massive bonus.

On top of that there is the point /u/Thormidable and /u/Llaine made, which is that any assets being actively used for war crimes have yet another legal grounds for seizure.

All of this is possible without making major changes to the legality of certain actions, i.e. mainly by enacting greater requirements for transparency.

These oligarchs basically have a giant crime ring going. It's kept in place by laws that err too far on the side of secrecy and privacy. It simply doesn't make sense to give that level of privacy to anyone with that much money.

You can look at other platforms (FB live, instagram live, etc...) But I'm absolutely not going to vouch for these.

Former president Yanukovych is still in exile in Russia, so maybe he’d be brought back? So it wouldn’t be an ‘annexation’ per say, it would be technically (at least in Russia’s narrative) an independent Ukraine, with a puppet government. The western narrative is that Russia is waging a war of conquest (to oversimplify). Something like an invasion of Poland doesn’t really factor directly here unless Putin is playing crazy ideological 4-D chess, which doesn’t seem to be the case. Non-historians on other subs are throwing around WW1 and 2 parallels. These might be interesting and generate clicks, but are generally unhelpful. 

In regards to nuclear war (aka conflict between Russia and a NATO nation) I think this is unlikely. It is of course possible, and has been since the Soviet Union developed the atomic bomb, but that would mean nuclear winter. And there is no ‘victor’ in such a war in any traditional sense. Some people are throwing around jingoistic rhetoric promoting NATO military action, but ‘limited’ war between nuclear powers hasn’t really been tried out before to my knowledge. Russian mercenaries fought US soldiers in Syria, I believe, but legally and politically that’s a lot different than a war between Russia and the US. From all the public rhetoric we’re seeing from Putin, Biden, and co., and based on traditional theory and practice, it’s extremely unlikely NATO would get into a war with Russia intentionally. The danger with a situation like Ukraine is that mistakes, accidents, tensions, and confusion increase the potential for things to go south.

There's no front line because it's unsustainable to have one in a place with Ukraine's geography.  The Ukrainians aren't giving them any high-value targets, forcing the Russians to rely on tactical CAS which they can counter with infantry weapons.

So the Russians can drive just about anywhere they want to, but they'll just keep stretching out their supply lines, and with the Ukrainians being subsidized and equipped with NATO weapons, capturing industrial centers won't do anything in the short term.  Meanwhile the Ukrainians can continually assault weak spots and supply convoys.

This has likely always been the Ukrainian strategy for defense.  It puts the onus on Russia to either ratchet up its attacks and start putting pressure on civilian centers (which will end badly for everyone involved, especially Putin), or pull back to more defensible positions near the Russian/Belorussian borders and hopefully sue for peace.  Either way it will become economically unsustainable since Russia economy was on the brink of collapse *before* the invasion and after the initial hopes for a quick victory are squashed, the confidence in the economy will hopefully plummet.

Your also clearly ignorant when it comes to making these comparisons. You cannot compare these other wars on a per km basis. Barbarossa was on a completely different scale and with entirely different levels of mechanization. Armies back then could not move as fast as they do today. The six day war and the gulf war took place in entirely different types of terrain. Depending on which gulf war you want to compare, the differences are huge but diverge in kind. The americans in the first gulf war reduced on the largest armies in the world to nothing in about 72 hours. Thats clearly not happening here. The second gulf war took about 3 weeks but much of the delay was due to weather and having to clear certain cities of militia fighters. You cannot compare this shit tit for tat. 

By comparison, the Russians have run into stiff resistance and are halted at every major urban center. Going around isnt going to be easy because the major road networks run through those cities. They cannot be easily bypassed, which is probably the reason they chose to frontally assault them one day one.

The northern approaches to the city should be extremely defensible as they're very marshy and it's late February. In spite of that they've allowed Russia to advance over 100 km into the suburbs of the city in just over a day. Things are bad just looking at a map, but are even worse when you actually examine what's going on on the ground.

In Kyiv, the defense appears to be completely disorganized; there doesn't appear to be any identifiable nests of resistance, Ukrainian artillery is a non-factor, and they're desperate enough to hand out assault rifles to civilians (apparently leading to multiple friendly-fire situations). Lightly-armed Russian paratrooper and reconnaissance units, without even artillery or air support, have been able to raid deep into the city with very few casualties.

With all that said, my question is:  
What are the possibilities of a very big escalation between NATO and Russia (and in that sense a nuclear MAD)\`? What will happen if Finland and Sweden decide to join NATO? Will that make Russia so mad, that they will escalate even more? Do they have any motivation in invading Poland? Is it possible that Russia won't be able to annex Ukraine or parts of it? I have heard that Putin doesn't seem a loss in this sense as an option. Can Russia actually see the militarization of Ukraine from the other Nations as an act of war?

[],False,,OperationMobocracy,,,[],,,,text,t2_124wre,False,False,"I think there's reasonable reasons a potential Ukrainian insurgency would be less successful than Afghanistan or Vietnam.  The Ukrainians lack the terrain advantages of the Taliban or Vietcong, and perhaps more importantly, Ukrainians by and large aren't a rural peasantry accustomed to pre-20th century primitive living.  Adapting to harsh field camp conditions was not really an issue for the Taliban or VC because by and large there wasn't much adaptation needed.

Although I think its also too easy to sell the Ukrainians short as potential insurgents.  I think they're equally capable of emotional/ideological adherence to their cause.  Literacy and educational backgrounds are better than peasant insurgencies, so they're more capable of adapting and making use of things like complex portable weapons.  They still retain the blend-into-the-civilian-population ability of other guerilla fighters.  They have enough racial and ethnic similarity to Russians that false flag/infiltration is pretty easy (although this can cut both ways).  There's a long and difficult to isolate border region for insurgent logistics and resupply.

I think its also worth noting that even where insurgencies ""failed"" or were suppressed to some degree of success, it still wasn't easy and took a long time.  The Syrians and their Russian and Iranian partners took years to suppress the rebels in Syria, and its not like Syria is anywhere near ""normal"" in terms of sovereign control of its territory.  Plus the Syrian rebels were always a divisive bunch with different goals -- Kurds, various flavors of Sunni militia, ISIS -- and often multiple enemies (the Kurds fought government troops, ISIS, and even Turkish forces).

In Iraq, the US needed both a surge of military force plus some degree of enablement mixed with cooption of local militias to suppress Iraqi insurgents, and quite of few pallets of cash handed out to buy temporary cooperation.  And in the end a major beneficiary were Shia militia aligned with Iran, so there's a lot of questions about what suppressing the insurgency ultimately meant.

I sometimes wonder if the better Ukrainian insurgency comparison isn't likely to be the Provisional IRA or some of the various anti-Nazi resistance groups which proved to be durable and difficult to suppress opponents for the Nazis.  The British were handcuffed by public opinion which prevented high intensity military force, but they also had the advantage of sovereign control of the territory and the support of half (or slightly more, depending on who you believe) of the local population.  The Nazis had basically no limits on their counter-insurgency options besides resources.  And both insurgencies proved frustratingly difficult to suppress.",3cabaa9c404ddad32444f872d23184f90551779d,True,False,,,,,0,1645877927,,0,{},hyi98in,False,t3_t1lv1q,False,True,t1_hyhhuiq,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t1lv1q/the_coming_ukrainian_insurgency_russias_invasion/hyi98in/,1645877952,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1645849127.0,

Basically turned Putin away from thinking that he could work with/deal with the West. Libya had actually ended its nuclear weapons program in a way that Iran never did/has, but Gaddafi got killed anyway. He got what was long since coming to him, in the abstract sense, but Putin apparently got alarmed by the Western powers more or less condoning/encouraging his overthrow despite his years-long cooperation with them. If I can find the article discussing this I'll post it.

&gt;Or the number of other conflicts Russia has been involved in since the USSR's collapse? Chechnya, for example.

I don't have problem with the principle that a country has broad latitude to handle internal affairs in its own way.

Nor a country, within limits, seeking to project power in its neighborhood. The principle of self-determination, as articulated by Wilson's Fourteen Principles a century ago, is very difficult to reconcile with condemning too heavily the Russian majority of Crimea seeking to leave Ukraine and rejoining Russia.

The current invasion of Ukraine is different. It's more akin to the German invasion of rump Czechoslovakia after receiving the Sudetenland.

&gt;In any event, from what I have read it seems clear that Putin's motivations go back much further than 2011, and rest on a sense of historical grievance and revanchism that is strongly tied to his memory of life as a member of the KGB and of the USSR's ruling class.

I'm not sure about that; at least, that that is the whole story. There is a good case to be made that Russia was strengthened after 1991 by losing chunks on the outer edges peopled by non-Russian ethnic groups.

NATO expansion isn't a satisfactory answer, either. NATO has bordered Russia since Norway became a charter member in 1949. Russia wasn't thrilled about Poland joining NATO but it seemed to be able to live with it, and one is hard pressed to say that NATO is actually strengthened by having the likes of Montenegro as members. Everyone knew that Ukraine wasn't going to be allowed to join NATO as long as the Crimea and eastern Ukraine territorial situations remained, so in practice Ukraine was permanently blocked.

So why this war? At least Hitler could cite *lebensraum* for Czechoslovakia. But no one thinks that Russia, whose population is shrinking anyway, needs more space. The only two things I can think of are:

* Russia feels the need to expand its borders and build buffer zones as much as possible before its demographic crisis really hits in a decade and the country can no longer staff its military. (Peter Zeihan has talked about this for years.)

* Putin really has, as Macron and others have observed/hinted, gone crazy.",a9ffff85e87a8c1bd4afab350fe582898637c8eb,True,False,,,,,0,1645868921,,0,{},hyhy123,False,t3_t163s1,False,True,t1_hyhvln7,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t163s1/options_for_intervention_in_ukraine_that_do_not/hyhy123/,1645868933,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1645840121.0,

&gt;”Because conscripts don't have their brains flushed when they leave. It's what sometimes called the Prussian model, based on the model the Prussians used in the lead up to WW1 that most other nations adopted to one degree or another. The result is a series of tiers.

First tier: professional army that can not only fight on it's own, but can also be used as a nucleus for the rapid expansion of the army.
Second tier: Conscripts actively serving at that time (18-22)
Third tier: Conscripts that have served their time within the last ten years. These are people that, with a little bit of work, can quickly be brought back to near professional level standards. (22-32)
Fourth tier: Conscripts more than years from their service. You won't get much true front line service out of them, but as second or even third line formation, they're serviceable (32-45)

The advantage of this is that, in a crisis, pretty much the entirety of the military age population can be put to military use to varying degrees almost immediately. The Germans in WW1 showed this explicitly, in their ability to raise gargantuan formations of reasonable quality very quickly with the declaration of full mobilization. And the British experience in the early years of the war illustrate the drawbacks of relying too much on a professional, all volunteer army, in that you had the original BEF which did great things. But once the six divisions of the BEF were gone...they were gone....and most of the institutional knowledge of the British army below the staff officer level with them. The result of course is that the British army effectively had to relearn how to fight, leading to such tragedies as the 1st of July, when a largely inexperienced but overwhelmingly volunteer BEF met the hardened and well-drilled conscripts of the German army.

The American army tries to strike a middle ground, a large enough force of regulars that can in theory absorb volunteers in huge quantities and expand rapidly. That's the theory. In practice, as some of the early debacles in WW2 proved, you're still going to have a point where that army is going to be comparatively green and a bloody, steep learning curve. However, as both world wars also proved, that advantage is not infinite for the conscript side either. A 25 year guy who did his two years conscript duty in 1907-1909 is going to have a clear advantage in 1914 over some guy who's first encounter with Army life began in August of 1914. But for the 1915-1919 conscript classes, they have no real advantage over the volunteer because they're literally in the exact same position and probably receiving the same training other than the fact the units they're assigned to will be better trained and positioned to smooth off their rough edges.

However, even in a meatgrinder like WW1, those 1887-1915 classes count for a lot. In many ways, it's really only the carnage on the Somme and at Verdun that finally succeeds in burning out not only the German professional army, but also the core of experienced conscripts that had done so well in the first three years of the war. This is a disaster of course because this is really the point where the efforts to really rebuild the British army really begin to bear fruit, where now the British army is producing soldiers at least as good as the trained conscripts of 1914 and sometimes better, while the Germans have lost that knowledge base. The German tendency to leave their units in the field, rather than cycling them, until they were almost completely destroyed...played a large part in this.”

[],False,,bleepblopbloopy,,,[],,,,text,t2_4lu6l,False,False,"LINES OF SUPPORT
The United States will invariably be a major and essential source of backing for a Ukrainian insurgency. During the Obama and Trump administrations, the United States acted with restraint in responding to Russian cyberattacks, disinformation, and military expansionism. Washington did not want to unleash a spiral of escalation it could not control, risking Russian reprisals against U.S. banks, businesses, and infrastructure. The Biden administration, however, has so far been less tentative in its dealings with Russia. To counter Russian moves, it has exposed Russia-associated hackers and recovered funds stolen through cyberattack ransoms, extradited Russian oligarchs to stand trial in the United States, and declassified intelligence on Russian plans in Ukraine to unify support among allies and shape the media narrative.

If a viable, independent Ukraine remains standing, whether ruled from Kyiv or Lviv (the largest city in the western part of the country), the United States and its NATO allies can openly aid in its in defense with weapons, training, and cash. It’s reasonable to deduce that the CIA’s legal charter to partner with foreign intelligence counterparts has allowed it to provide training and materials to its Ukrainian partners for years, just as U.S. military trainers have worked with and supplied their Ukrainian counterparts.

This aid will have to become covert if Russia seizes the government and fully occupies the country. Military support for action against a sovereign country with which the United States is not at war has to be clandestine, much like U.S. support for the Afghan mujahideen against the Soviet Union in the 1980s, for Iraq’s Kurds prior to the 2003 invasion, and, less successfully, for rebels in Syria a decade ago. Attacking behind enemy lines would require a presidential covert action finding funded by Congress. Of course, a version of this authorization probably already exists and might at most need modification by the White House as a new congressional Memorandum of Notification to accommodate the shifting circumstances.

Supporting an insurgency is in the CIA’s DNA. Its forerunner, the Office of Strategic Services, came into its own during World War II through supporting resistance forces in France, the Netherlands, and East Asia. The CIA’s recent experience in supporting and fighting insurgencies in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria prepares it well for opposing Russia’s modern, conventional forces. The United States can help Ukrainian insurgents in hitting targets with the greatest military value and psychological impact.

A Yahoo News report in January described a covert CIA training program for elite Ukrainian special operations forces and other intelligence personnel that was launched in 2015 by the Obama administration following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. According to the report, the effort included the deployment of CIA paramilitary officers to Ukraine. Such programs mature over time as trust grows between the trainers and their foreign counterparts and as the recipients teach what they have learned to others.

U.S. and Ukrainian officials have long planned for this day. In all likelihood, a covert program to help organize the resistance to Russia already has communications infrastructure, intelligence collection capabilities, and operational plans in place. And the tactics developed to support defensive operations against an invader can transition to those aimed at hobbling an occupying force.

FORCES UNLEASHED
An anti-Russian insurgency will no doubt face obstacles and endure setbacks. Putin is aware of the possibility of Ukrainian resistance to a wider Russian occupation. U.S. officials have alleged that the Russian government maintains lists of Ukrainian political and security officials it would arrest—or even assassinate—once it has seized the country and lists of pro-Kremlin figures it would hope to install. Russia would seek to undermine any insurgency by moving expeditiously to eliminate likely leaders and enablers of the resistance.    

An insurgency against Russian forces in Ukraine will take time to gather steam and achieve its goals. Resistance movements can take years—not months—to mature, organize, and achieve a meaningful offensive tempo. Even as an American, I could have easily walked the streets or dined in the cafes of Kabul in 2002 and Baghdad in 2003 without a care in the world. But a year or two later, I had to wear body armor and be accompanied by a protective security detail that ferried me around in heavily armored vehicles, hoping to avoid ambushes and improvised explosive device strikes.

Russia’s military advantages will diminish as the enemy it fights becomes a decentralized and mobile resistance.
Ukrainian insurgents will have to reckon with advances in modern technology that make their work more difficult. During World War II, the Vietnam War, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, organized bands of partisans could disperse to the countryside or into the hills. Escaping the reach of occupying forces is harder now thanks to drones, satellites, and thermal imagery. Insurgents will undertake cross-border raids but sustained military operations further behind enemy lines will require help from those living in such areas—people leading ostensibly normal lives who secretly have access to weapons and secure communications and can thereby evade Russian detection. The Russians will label the attacks of these operatives as acts of terrorism while people in the West will applaud them as the deeds of freedom fighters.

Early on, it is likely the Russians will uncover many rings of insurgents, quickly unmasking the insurgency’s initial leaders after years of Russian intelligence collection. But insurgencies adapt swiftly—far faster than the large, structured armies they are fighting—and new leaders emerge molded by their adverse early experiences. Their agility becomes an enormous advantage.

Russia would hope to either limit its incursion to parts of Ukraine whose populations might be more inclined to accept Russian rule or act with such lightning speed so as to seize and pacify the country before a viable resistance can find its legs. But Russia’s military advantages over Ukrainian forces will diminish as the enemy it fights changes from an organized army to a decentralized and mobile resistance. Occupation forces will be subject to harassing attacks designed to both inflict casualties and undermine military discipline. An influence campaign replete with horrific images of carnage—of both civilian Ukrainian and Russian military deaths—will aim to sow antiwar sentiment in Russia and counter Moscow’s narrative that their forces were welcomed as liberators by grateful locals.

Putin’s motivations in starting this war of choice remain the subject of great debate. They may become clearer in the coming days and weeks as Russia continues its offensive. But if his aims are maximalist—redrawing borders or even toppling the current government—an insurgency is inevitable. For both Putin and his enemies, it will be hard to control the forces that have now been unleashed.",2f9491f25829be7b849b235c2a7ca15f7f03773d,True,False,,,,,0,1645843388,,0,{},hygswcn,True,t3_t1lv1q,False,True,t1_hygsvo2,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t1lv1q/the_coming_ukrainian_insurgency_russias_invasion/hygswcn/,1645843406,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1645814588.0,
[],False,,bleepblopbloopy,,,[],,,,text,t2_4lu6l,False,False,"Russian forces have struck targets across Ukraine and seized key facilities and swaths of territory. The Ukrainian military is no match for this Russian juggernaut. Although some reports suggest Ukrainian troops have rebuffed attacks in certain parts of the country, it seems more likely that Russian President Vladimir Putin will decide just how far Russia goes into Ukraine. As a retired Russian-speaking CIA operations officer who served in Central Asia and managed agency counterinsurgency operations, I did not think Putin would have attacked Ukraine unless he had already devised a reliable end game, given the costs of an intractable conflict. But Putin’s best-laid plans might easily unravel in the face of popular Ukrainian national resistance and an insurgency.

If Russia limits its offensive to the east and south of Ukraine, a sovereign Ukrainian government will not stop fighting. It will enjoy reliable military and economic support from abroad and the backing of a united population. But if Russia pushes on to occupy much of the country and install a Kremlin-appointed puppet regime in Kyiv, a more protracted and thorny conflagration will begin. Putin will face a long, bloody insurgency that could spread across multiple borders, perhaps even reaching into Belarus to challenge Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, Putin’s stalwart ally. Widening unrest could destabilize other countries in Russia’s orbit, such as Kazakhstan, and even spill into Russia itself. When conflicts begin, unpredictable and unimaginable outcomes can become all too real. Putin may not be prepared for the insurgency—or insurgencies—to come.

WINNER’S REMORSE
Many a great power has waged war against a weaker one, only to get bogged down as a result of its failure to have a well-considered end game. This lack of foresight has been especially palpable in troubled occupations. It was one thing for the United States to invade Vietnam in 1965, Afghanistan in 2001, and Iraq in 2003; likewise for the Soviet Union to enter Afghanistan in 1979. It was an altogether more difficult task to persevere in those countries in the face of stubborn insurgencies.

Russia can likely seize as much of Ukraine’s territory as it chooses. But plans to pacify Ukraine will require far more than the reserve forces Putin has suggested might occupy the territory as “peacekeepers” after initial combat objectives are met. Thanks to Putin’s aggression, anti-Russian fervor and homegrown nationalism have surged in Ukraine. Ukrainians have spent the last eight years planning, training, and equipping themselves for resisting a Russian occupation. Ukraine understands that no U.S. or NATO forces will come to its rescue on the battlefield. Its strategy doesn’t depend on turning back a Russian invasion, but rather in bleeding Moscow so as to make occupation untenable.  

When conflicts begin, unpredictable and unimaginable outcomes can become all too real.
Any future insurgency will benefit from Ukraine’s geography. The country is bordered by four NATO states: Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia. Belarus, a Russian ally, is itself bordered by Poland on the west and another NATO member—Lithuania—on the north. These long borders offer the United States and NATO an enduring way to support Ukrainian resistance and a long-term insurgency and to stoke unrest in Belarus should the United States and its allies choose to covertly aid opposition to Lukashenko’s regime.

Moldova, to the southwest of Ukraine, is also an intriguing player. Although nominally neutral (neutrality is written into its constitution), Moldova has cooperated in the past with the United States and NATO; it has a somewhat frigid relationship with Moscow thanks to ongoing tensions over the breakaway republic of Transnistria, a narrow strip of land along the Moldovan-Ukrainian border. Moscow props up this separatist entity, which is garrisoned by Russian troops in the name of “peacekeeping.” Its role in Transnistria is pushing Moldova toward the West. Last November, Maia Sandu, a former Moldovan prime minister, defeated the Russia-backed incumbent president. Moldova is not likely to overtly provoke the Kremlin, but Sandu might be willing to covertly cooperate with Ukraine’s resistance.

As the United States learned in Vietnam and Afghanistan, an insurgency that has reliable supply lines, ample reserves of fighters, and sanctuary over the border can sustain itself indefinitely, sap an occupying army’s will to fight, and exhaust political support for the occupation at home. Russia would also have to think twice before trying to chase insurgents across the border into Poland, for instance, since such actions could trigger war with NATO.",cd5a246d369f6cf8a9acfa112a7ce5ff1a8d6b10,True,False,,,,,0,1645843378,,0,{},hygsvo2,True,t3_t1lv1q,False,True,t3_t1lv1q,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t1lv1q/the_coming_ukrainian_insurgency_russias_invasion/hygsvo2/,1645843390,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1645814578.0,

This is a propaganda win not just in Russia but in Ukraine and for a lot of Eastern European civilians (although not governments, right now). It's also pretty important in the West, both because large segments of the Western population don't like Nazis and because many Western Nazis went to train in and with Azov, Right Sector etc. All for a couple thousand troops, maybe 10,000 at the maximum. Are they really that worth it, that critical to the war effort? 4 years ago? Could they not at the absolute minimum break up the Nazi regiments and spread the neo-Nazis amongst the rest of the military with orders to watch them and prevent war crimes?


It's just a really dumb move internationally. Having openly Nazi organisations in your military is going to make it politically harder for other nations to aid you, because being on the same side as the Nazis is not generally a public relations win. It's also bad for the Ukrainian citizenry and relief efforts during the war, as some lists of Ukrainian charities to donate to include organisations funding the Nazi regiments, and there has rightly been backlash and people pointing out that funding Nazis is not an appropriate response to the Russian invasion. That interferes with the relief drive for all of those charities on those lists, not just the ones funneling money and arms to Nazis.
