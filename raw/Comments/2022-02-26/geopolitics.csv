It isn't. Ukraine would have had to create its own nuclear program basically from scratch.

&gt; think the fact that both the EU and Russia, at the time, were pushing for nuclear disarmament is indicative of the fact that they potentially did, or at least could have eventually.

The whole world didn't want to see nukes getting loose in unstable post-soviet states, not because they could have been launched as is, but because they could have been used to make dirty bombs, sold to other actors, etc. 

It's widely acknowledged Ukraine certainly couldnt have used these nukes as is, and very likely had no means to make their own program. 

This whole argument is frankly non-sensical, if Ukraine had refused to hand over their nukes, they would have become a rogue state and the world would have actually welcomed Russia invading the country.",107993e81093857ffe871106508cf60581e7b9d2,True,False,,,,,0,1645914442,,0,{},hykikq6,False,t3_t0cgvt,False,True,t1_hyj7pb1,/r/geopolitics/comments/t0cgvt/ukraine_megathread_all_new_posts_go_here_so_long/hykikq6/,1645914457,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1645885642.0,

Western defence attaches have claimed that Valery Gerasimov, Putin’s most senior commander and the chief of the general staff of Russia’s armed forces, had warned the president that invading Ukraine might not be straightforward. And so it has proved. For now, though, Russia’s military and political leadership are firmly behind the operation.  
  
As losses mount, difficult questions pile up for the Kremlin. In the face of Ukrainian intransigence and resistance, how does it intend to govern the country? Any Donetsk-style puppet government would lack legitimacy. Even if Moscow succeeds in seizing Kyiv, months and years of problems lie ahead. Nobody expects Ukrainians to capitulate. More likely is partisan war.

[],False,,VictoryForCake,,,[],,,,text,t2_ciiwo,False,False,"The difference is that America had a lot more support, power, and influence to either negate or weather the reactions to the Iraq war. America had economic, cultural, political, and international influence that it could afford to burn through if necessary, and had allies who supported the Iraq war. America in 2003 was the economic hegemon for the Western world, and arguably the whole world, so sanctions were essentially unthinkable as it would akin to shooting yourself in the foot with an RPG. In contrast Russia doesn't have the same level of economic importance beyond its hydrocarbon supplies which probably will not be sanctioned.

Americas soft power in terms of cultural influence is a big contrast to Russia's. In terms of global cultural influence and soft power America did suffer from Iraq, being seen as a warmonger and trying to enforce its own geopolitical goals in the gulf region, however, the global presence of America culture, and its influence through all forms of media meant turning people hard against America did not occur, sure there was criticism of the war and some attempts at boycotts etc., but outside of some mostly irrelevant gestures and groups in the western world people kept drinking coca cola, listening to Madonna, and watching Desperate Housewifes. In short people would criticise the Iraq war and Americas role in it but at the same time not stand against the US. Russia by contrast has very little cultural soft power in the world which means it is not as insulated from criticism, peoples attitudes towards Russia are influenced almost entirely by its political actions and domestic attitudes, unlike the US. As a result a compartmentalisation if you will did/will not occur separating the conflict and country for this current conflict as it did in the Iraq war, Russia and its war are now one and the same to everyone.

Its also important to notice the justifications or pretext for both conflicts, in the buildup to the Iraq war there was popular discussion in the media about Iraqs links to Islamic terrorism, 9/11, and the procurement of WMD's. In hindsight we know these were extremely dubious and exaggerated, however, at the time the justification meant that at least the reaction to the war was mixed, rather than an outright war of aggression it was a mission to secure global peace, fight a dictator, and to bring ""democracy"" to the people of Iraq, the mixed reaction is key. You need to compare that to Russias current war where the international reaction was almost completely negative and condemning, and where the pretexts for Russian intervention are a known fabrication, and its goals to be aggressive. A war of dubious justification and a war of outright aggression will produce very different reactions internationally.

A final point is that Ukraine is in Europe, the attitudes towards Ukraine are far different to a conflict that would originate in the Middle East or Africa as the people are different. You can see that through the willingness of European countries to take in Ukrainian refugees in the thousands compared to the massive arguments that broke out over distributing the Afghan refugees. Its a factor in all of this that needs to be still counted, even if it makes people uncomfortable.",20f4391a597b76e1c598ac5c6e10ad698c7857a4,True,False,,,,,0,1645904290,,0,{},hyjum5p,False,t3_t0cgvt,False,True,t1_hyilx9k,/r/geopolitics/comments/t0cgvt/ukraine_megathread_all_new_posts_go_here_so_long/hyjum5p/,1645904302,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1645875490.0,

First, how long it would have taken to amass all the troops and equipment along the border if they started just now?

Second, plausible deniability requires that Russia maintains the facade of protecting the interests of Russian-speaking Ukranians. Acting reactively after a hypothetical announcement of a NATO membership would have been even less defensible. Plus, Russia couldn't risk that an understanding agreement between Ukraine and NATO could be used to invoke a more direct involvement by the latter.

Third, it's still winter time in the northern hemisphere. Russia's leverage over Europe because of its gas exports is much more effective now than it would be some months from now. 

&gt;Maybe it's as simple as ""risk analysis said this was the best moment"", but then why does the invasion seem so haphazard? Is it pure propaganda that Russian forces are having major logistical issues, and seem lacking in training and supplies? Is it just major miscalculation or hubris on the Russian side? Were they really unable to drum up better support internally?

Also, they were already able to assess NATO military response live: look up what Russia's response was to Turkey downing one of its Su-24's back in 2015, it was so overwhelming that Erdogan ended up inventing a conspiracy theory in which the pilots involved in the shooting were part of the Gülen movement (not counting how massive and destructive the aerial campaign in Latakia and Idlib was against Turkey-align groups).

In my opinion this line of thought is just mainly fueled by wishful thinking from people who would like to see their adversaries annihilate each other without themselves lifting a finger rather than genuine geopolitical analysis.

I don't see how it would help China's demographics, it's population is decreasing, not increasing. It doesn't need more land, it needs younger people. Russia's demographics are also terrible so I don't see how conquering Siberia of all places helps anything, are they going to start euthanizing all the elderly that comes with it? 

Is it necessary for China to personally manage whatever agricultural or industrial output Siberia can produce? It is not like Russia is refusing trade with China, if anything Russia will need all the trade partners it can get after their invasion of Ukraine; so China will have favorable deals for it. Surely, the cost of mobilizing your armed forces to occupy a territory would far outweigh the cost of simply buying their produce. America spent trillions occupying territory in the Middle East, how much would China spend to occupy Siberia?

Finally, it is simply the matter of fact I don't believe Siberia sits very high in China's list of territorial priorities even if it does have eyes on it. The number one, of course, is Taiwan. The moment China takes such as an aggressive action as full on occupation of its neighbor, do you think countries around it will simply just smile and nod along? It would give all its neighbors reason to greatly increase their own military spending. What if other countries form alliances against it out of fear? What if they start pursuing their own nuclear weapons? So I think occupying Siberia in such a scenario is completely out of the question until the Taiwan question is settled. By achieving a lower priority, it would make their number one priority much more harder to achieve, if not outright impossible. In my opinion, if China wants to occupy anything, it has to be Taiwan first and foremost otherwise it is just committing political suicide down the road.",67ef1fa9763076f471efae1a521ab0b5bfa1e3bd,True,False,,,,,0,1645895368,,0,{},hyj8nwp,False,t3_t1ych7,False,True,t3_t1ych7,/r/geopolitics/comments/t1ych7/is_china_about_to_start_gunning_for_siberia/hyj8nwp/,1645895383,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1645866568.0,

We have been living through a global pandemic for two years, and every involvement in foreign wars and conflicts by the US and the west has gained more criticism and less support among the majority in most developed countries. As much as we can criticize the involvement in foreign conflicts including the Middle East particularly, and profit is always at least one motive, there has been some debate about the morality given the innocent people typically at risk and killed by internal turmoil, and potential external threat to other countries (the lingering fear of terrorist since 9/11, as an example). 

There is far less debate or justification of nation building, colonialism or empire expansion in this century, particularly given the threat of nuclear and biochemical warfare. 

I think most people would agree with you that Russia would be better off just becoming another nation, as the inherent flaws (by design) of a generally democratic nation is the limit of power of a strong central government, and the distraction and division of infighting among groups or political parties, so long as those don’t become violent or too charged. From the 50’s through 2000’s (excluding the past decade) in the US, political inefficiency, relatively healthy wealth inequality, and generally peaceful and respectful debate between parties has kept violence and poverty to manageable levels, while allowing economic prosperity. 

As far as political and economic systems, Canada, Australia and much of Europe have done a better job IMO of achieving a balance of healthy democracies that benefit society as a whole while also not becoming an oligopoly, but that is another discussion. 

The problem with authoritarianism is that it requires a constant large amount of effort to maintain strict control over everything, and authoritarian cultures always struggle with evolution, progress, and technology that improves the lives of all. It’s far more challenging to run a very strict nation or household, as a way to compensate for the human fear of having a lack of control. 

An analogy can be made to parenting; it can require a lot more stress, effort and constant vigilance to run a very strict, authoritarian household/family, and the threat of revolt or opposition is always much greater, and serves to provide the emotional safety of a sense of control for the parent, and an obedient child, whereas an authoritative parent/household will have a more healthy balance of respect, autonomy, and allowing for adaptation or the need to manage emergencies and uncertainties.",a8516f88dbc55192ee6eaceb8b201ad01d283d44,True,False,,,,,0,1645894939,,0,{},hyj7mfg,False,t3_t020va,False,True,t1_hyj3tu6,/r/geopolitics/comments/t020va/russia_invasion_of_ukraine_live_thread/hyj7mfg/,1645894954,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1645866139.0,

The Chinese don’t make opportunistic moves on allies. Rather, the only situation in which there would be a Chinese invasion of Mongolia and Siberia is if Russia collapses and there are indications that NATO would expand into Mongolia and Siberia. Then the Chinese could be forced to make a play to create a buffer zone.

&gt;WHY IS that, and what is to be done to balance this ideological superstructure? The prevalent view is that unipolarity, a unique geopolitical aberration, and American geographic security made primacy the default cost-free option. Put simply, the American foreign policy establishment prefers meddling around the globe because they can afford to without cost or political price. “Beyond lobbies and interest groups, the national-security bureaucracy tends to support primacy because it benefits their organizational health,” Justin Logan wrote. “The scale of state power in the United States, including the size of its military and the government institutions dedicated to administering its foreign policy were in categories all by themselves.” This pessimism is shared by Patrick Porter, who argued that power and habit propel the imperial foreign policy. **Elsewhere, Stephen Walt and John Mearsheimer have argued that *foreign lobbies and ideological liberals* with an urge to “do something” are behind this instinctive internationalism and primacy.**


Something about America's policy doesn't make sense. None of America's foreign adventures ever seem to benefit America in anyway, with social and economic conditions  in America declining all the time. Instead of trying to build an economic union with Central and South America which entails a strong social compact, America alway engages in escapades far from its shores, instead of trying to fix the conditions within America itself and its backyard.

It faces an unrelenting illegal immigration from Central and South American countries due to the poor conditions in those regions. Instead of focusing on economic policy such as Germany is doing in trying to build the EU, or China's BRI, it is focused on military adventures and cries fouls at China's growing strength.

Is America indifferent to its backyard because straightening out affairs there means supporting European Latins, Blacks, Mestizos and Native Americans? Is America indifferent to the long term development of those regions because the bulk of the population there is not *white* enough but would rather go on to fix non-existent problems in Europeans because they are white, or is there another agenda driven by **foreign lobbies and ideological liberals**?

America organizes military exercises with Ukrainian forces and feigns surprise when Putin invades and occupies Ukraine with the clear intention of never ever allowing NATO and or American troops to set foot there again.

What is the purpose of NATO in any case? Why can't Europeans defend themselves? Why can't Germany build up its mililtary properly?

To what extent would America tolerate Russian forces engaging in military exercises with Cuba, with the option of placing missiles there in some future, let alone Mexico and Canada? This is what America is engaged in against Russia and cries foul when Russia takes what it considers to be decisive action. People should harbour no illusions about Putin's determination. The guy really means everything he says because he has no illusions as to what is really at stake here. What truly matters is whether he can get the hearts and minds of the Russian people fully behind him. We are talking about rivalries and struggle for power in Russia which goes right back to the Bolshevik revolution and earlier.

Putin has made his first move. The man is livid and he intends to get Europe and Germany in particular to decide which way it wants to go where their relationship with the US is concerned. If Russia has no militaristic intentions, then there is no need for NATO or an American military presence in Europe. Europe needs to make its own destiny without an American military presence in her affairs.

Putin is willing to pay the economic price for standing against the US. Are Russians as a whole willing to pay? They did so for 80 years and they can and will do it again if they agree with Putin and don't resent his autocratic tendencies too much.

Will Russia kowtow to the **foreign lobbies and ideological liberals** who drive America's imperialist foreign policy? Europe seemingly has. Perhaps Russia will force them to reconsider, Germany in particular.",a08d8280393437b6a26f62270d82ae741586301d,True,False,,,,,0,1645892028,,0,{},hyj0jl4,True,t3_t1ydq4,False,True,t3_t1ydq4,/r/geopolitics/comments/t1ydq4/a_grand_strategy_of_restraint_needs_a_counter/hyj0jl4/,1645892046,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1645863228.0,

The German's hoping Russia is a minor blip in that trend isn't crazy.

I don't think anyone looks down on the German's even now as well, because like Japan,  you should never underestimate industrial powers. Their live military appears small, but if they got pushed, they could produce a powerful modern military incredibly fast.

The saying is that Japan might not have nukes, but they could produce nukes fast or something like that.

Honestly though, even if Germany on it's own did, it would be less impactful than the EU as a whole moving towards creating a basic unified EU military. That doesn't mean that they should spend a higher %, just use the current % together.

I agree with concerns some  people have towards an EU army, such that in the long run it could end up being globally destabilising, but right now, the lack of one is destabilizing the European region itself.

Also, the Western hype about International Law (IL) is unmerited. Everyone knows that IL has its limits, and that the West violates it too (often because it needs violating). But suddenly making IL the lens by which to evaluate Russia's actions is the height of hypocrisy, in addition to just being misguided. 

Ultimately, this is a clash of ideas with respect to world order, and must be seen that way. And it is the West's ideas about global order that are in many ways new and strange, not Russia's. Now, for many reasons including how small the world is now given technological advancement, the West's idea of global order may be more correct. Or at least something that is more conducive to world prosperity than Russia's. But Putin's ideas here are not that strange. He isn't bent on rampant world conquest--Ukraine really is, to some extent, part of Russsia in many ways. It is also a sovereign country. But it really is complex. 

Moreover, the shock that Putin is doing this is totally without basis. Putin warned everyone for years and years. If anything, the West has acted recklessly, encouraging Georgia and Ukraine to write checks their armies could not cash, and that the West couldn't cash for them due to Russia being a nuclear power. Ideals have to give way to pragmatism, at least to a great extent, when nuclear weapons are involved. This was why the Cold War was cold. 

Yes, Russia is ultimately responsible for this in many ways. But so is the West. It misplayed its hand out of reckless hubris. It is true that Russia and the Liberal International Order were intractably at odds, in a zero sum game. The ultimate Western goal was regime change in Russia, and more deeply, a transformation in Russia's attitude towards geopolitics. And this may have been the right goal, but given that Russia has nuclear weapons, it had to be pursued much more carefully and probably over a longer time period. This didn't have to happen. 

That said, to be fair, geopolitics are hard. Mistakes are a given. So it is hard to fully blame the West.

[],False,,Beginning_Beginning,,,[],,,,text,t2_24531htf,False,False,"You just have to see the trail of events that have been occurring since years ago to understand that this invasion was just waiting to happen. Russia knew since 2008 that NATO had the intention to expand towards Ukraine - it was announced that year - something unacceptable for Russia from a strategic standpoint. 

Pro-Russian Yanukovich was ousted by the Orange Revolution in 2005 allegedly because of vote-rigging. Then came Yuschenko, the guy in power when NATO expansion was announced. It has always caught my attention that Yanukovich won once again in 2010, why? He was the bad guy that was previously ousted, and yet he beat Yulia Tymoshenko and Yuschenko came fifth in those elections! It's important to remember that Yuschenko's administration was labelled a ""kleptocracy"" by US diplomatic cables (which is a lot to say within a country regularly ranked in the top-ten most corrupt countries in the world), there were inner strives within the government ranks and also the guys in charge didn't play along with the oligarchs: Tymoshenko targeted their assets following the Orange Revolution and that was part of her downfall. 

In any case we know there were many economic and political interests at stake since then and it seemed like the country and its resources were up for grabs, opposing interest groups playing hardball to maintain power. 

In 2013-2014 the pro-Russian president was ousted again for favoring closer ties to Russia in a revolution - or coup, whatever you want to call it. It was obvious by then that the plan was to get Ukraine into NATO: Not only the new government was going to create policies contrary to closer ties to Russia, the intentions had already been stated regarding Ukraine's admittance to NATO (and also of progressively sidelining Russian economic interests). So Russia began a long term plan of destabilization which was logical in its execution: First, taking Crimea, then creating separatist hot-spots in the Donbas region. In the years afterwards, and while Ukraine wasn't part of NATO, there was increased military cooperation between it and other Western countries. One example is operation UNIFIER that brought Canadian military personnel into the country since 2016 and was extended all the way to 2025. 

Since 2019 the Ukrainian government had begun showing an even more hard-line approach hinting at even closer relations with the West (perhaps an imminent request for NATO admission? we don't have enough intelligence to assert that). However we do know that the bill  “On the Indigenous Peoples of Ukraine” was passed on last July and prompted a big negative response from Russia (perhaps even as an excuse to bolster the narrative of discrimination towards Russians which is part of Putin's official rationale for invading): The pro-Russian Opposition Platform For Life party - which held 44 seats in the Ukrainian parliament, making it second only to the ruling party’s 244-seat majority - insisted that the government was singling out privileged “indigenous peoples” and intensifying the “oppression” of Russian-speaking Ukrainians, and refused to vote the law in block. 

In March 2021, Zelensky imposed sanctions on 82 Russian companies including media outlets such as Lenta.ru and Gazeta.ru. The measures included blocking physical and financial assets, annulling licences and ending trade operations. Then in November he voted the anti-oligarch law, which further targeted Russian interests in Ukraine. Back in November Ukraine was already denouncing plans for a Russian-backed coup and even plans for invasion. 

So... it was going to happen, the writing was all over the wall. Russia probably did risk analysis and realized that the huge political and economic cost that this will have on the country was still less than having Ukraine being part of NATO and completely western-aligned. So, as I wrote, we don't have the intelligence to assess why this was the chosen moment but I'm pretty sure this scenario has already been planned since years ago.",8269cd7abe3aa4013c649030e6e6e533e9658260,True,False,,,,,0,1645889395,,0,{},hyiufst,False,t3_t0cgvt,False,True,t1_hyh98uc,/r/geopolitics/comments/t0cgvt/ukraine_megathread_all_new_posts_go_here_so_long/hyiufst/,1645889407,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1645860595.0,

If the US gets dragged into defending Taiwan; will Europe be able to defend herself without American troops, logistics, intelligence, &amp; leadership? If European countries refuse to raise their defense spending after this to the 2% levels they're acting on hubris.

Everyone serious knows that while IL is useful, it has limits. But trying to use IL as the reason that Russia is in the wrong just makes the West look like hypocrites, since they too break IL.

Still, it isn't as if Russian rhetoric is at all sane, either. So one must look past the talk. You cannot look at all geopolitical actions purely through a legalistic lens, with the inference that any violation of IL is equal in moral culpability. Also, subjectivity only takes you so far: it is important to understand each side, but at some point you may have to decide who is right, or at least more right than the other.

There are clear differences between Russia's invasion of Ukraine and America's invasion of Iraq. Ultimately, Putin's invasion of Ukraine is a classic geopolitical move: 19th Century thinking. On the other hand, the US invasion of Iraq was a modern, Liberal International Order (LIO), type move. The US was trying to maintain the post-WW II order, which is ostensibly for everyone's benefit and not just America's. (Many American's believe the LIO actually benefits the US less than it does most other countries.)

Also, while the Security Council may not have approved the US invasion, Iraq was pretty much begging to be invaded in every way a nation possibly could. It sat astride the center or World petroleum. It had invaded Kuwait before. It was a fairly brutal dictatorship. It used chemical weapons and seemed to be flirting with nuclear ones.

""For almost two decades, Putin deftly balanced the dual threats that confront all autocrats: coups from other elites and protests from the masses. A booming economy in the first decade of this century allowed him to consolidate power, and his successful annexation of Crimea in 2014 ensured his place in Russian history. Putin could manipulate elections and public opinion, deliver rents to his cronies while still improving the living standards for the masses, and bask in high approval ratings.  
Yet as the warm glow of his Crimea success has faded, Putin has struggled to find a narrative to legitimate his rule. A decade of slow economic growth, a botched response to the pandemic, corruption, and simple Putin fatigue among the populace have all blunted his tools for governing Russia. As I argued in the May/June 2021 issue of Foreign Affairs, Putin has therefore come to rely more heavily on the security services to maintain his grip on power, a dangerous bargain that necessitates greater repression at home and risks greater belligerence abroad. The invasion of Ukraine both flows from and reinforces this bargain, making Putin more dependent on the men in uniform who encourage his aggression.""",4afde98e8a0fc9e2fa184abc8a58240629daea83,True,False,,,,,0,1645887131,,0,{},hyipglv,True,t3_t1ysgc,False,True,t3_t1ysgc,/r/geopolitics/comments/t1ysgc/putins_war_at_home_how_conflict_in_ukraine/hyipglv/,1645887146,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1645858331.0,

No it isn't. The fact remains that Ukraine and NATO pose absolutely no threat to nuclear armed Russia, and it is completely absurd to argue otherwise. If that wasn't already clear, The West not coming to the aid of Ukraine as Russia brutalizes that nation should have made it clear. NATO could have swept the skies of Russian planes and destroyed every Russian tank that has rolled through to terrorize and murder their neighbors, but they didn't.

Putin claiming that NATO is a threat is a bold faced lie. Putin just wants to be remembered as ""Putin the Great"" who started to restore the Russian Empire by reincorporating Ukraine.

&gt;It doesn't matter if Russia is an aggressor, and that the USA is nice to its neighbors.

Yeah, it actually does. Canada isn't joining international defensive alliances because the US isn't going to attack them like Russia has attacked it's neighbors in the past couple of decades. Actions have consequences, and if you brutalize your neighbors, they will seek to get away from you by joining up with people that will help them defend themselves.

&gt;From Russia's perspective, that is a HUGE threat to national security. They will protect their own national interests - that's just how it works.

From the Russian perspective, Ukraine is a territory to conquer and be add to their empire.  Just listen to speech Putin gave before he attacked if you were confused on this point.  He makes it very clear that Ukraine is a part of the Russian empire and not a real nation.  

The only security risk Russia faces is their megalomaniacs leader who is okay with murdering Ukrainians to expand his empire. Again, nuclear armed Russia was in no danger from being attacked by their weak neighbor or the defensive NATO alliance. The only nation at risk and in need of protection is Ukraine.

&gt;Your argument is the equivalent of telling the bully: 'oh yeah well you brought this on yourself'. Technically true, but the bully is so enmeshed within his place in the world that what else can he do?

Putin was lying to the world when he claimed he was conducting a ""training exercise"", and he was lying when he said that the invasion of Ukraine was about his fear of defensive NATO alliance attacking nuclear armed Russia.

[],False,,Wanghaoping99,,,[],,,,text,t2_t6g13xr,False,False,"I personally think that Putin will try to anoint a successor in order to ensure that the political machinery he put in place continues to function, though I agree he is unlikely to step away while alive. 

In the situation you describe, I believe that the political apparatus represented by the United Russia party publicly and by shadowy government bodies in secret would move quickly to find a replacement.  The ever-so-often protests make clear that they would face dire consequences if they were ever to relinquish the tools of the state. They will capitalise on their  de facto possession of the legalistic channels of power, be it legislative, executive or judicial, to quickly usher in a new leader and minimise political turmoil. If done quickly enough, this could result in the quick interdiction of overt malcontents, compelling the rest of the population into acquiescence . 

The oligarches who run much of the economy will likely also acquiesce to the decision. As ruthless businessmen, they do not trust each other not to sabotage the rest by using political office for self-profit. We are talking people like Abramovich, who betrayed his mentor and friend Bezerovsky just to get closer to Putin.  Even if they did try to appoint their figurehead, the systems of state control over Russia's corporations would likely inhibit them from taking action without dire consequences.  Moreover, the political institutions would be mobilised against them by Putin's former support network, resulting in their repression and the enthronement of a state-backed successor. 

The problem with identifying potential heirs is that the opaqueness of Russia's governmental structures makes it harder to identify who wields the most power. Currently the most visible runners are Mikhail Mishustin, former tax officer and current prime minister of Russia. Dmitry Medvedev, who was previously a president of Russia during Putin's prime minister stint, is also considered for the position. Medvedev appears to have taken a huge blow politically, suffering low political ratings as a consequence of Russia's economic woes, but is also now part of the group of security advisers behind Putin. Sergei Shoigu and Sobyanin both occupy prominent positions and are also potentially viable. These are all people with distinguished careers, and some have even had remarkable accomplishments in their stints (Shoigu for instance is primarily responsible for the Crimean and Donbass takeovers). Hence I believe there is a corollary to your statement that Putin has gotten rid of all the capable people that could oppose him - that he has left room for those talents who are willing to serve him unquestioningly. 

Unfortunately I must agree that Putin's demise would be inadequate to collapse the system he has carefully engineered to aggregate power. Nor indeed would it overcome the Russian nationalist outlook that captures their political class (even the legal opposition like Zyuganov and Zhirinovsky have espoused favouring absorption of post-Soviet states. Not that you would want either of them in power. One's an actual hypernationalist and the other a communist). The desire to control the near abroad is fed by Russia's own poor geography and cultural perceptions. These will not go away even when Putin does, and will continue to permeate Russian society. Indeed, all of Putin's subordinates, the heirs apparent, espouse similar views to Putin himself. Putin has also controlled much of the civil space with institutions like the GONGOs which drastically reduce the avenues by which Russians can translate their dissent into resistance. Politically he has ensured that United Russia has control over all Russian affairs, serving as his vehicle to broadcast his power to all parts of Russia. The opposition, few as they are, are nowhere nearly powerful enough to dethrone the ruling party. What little there are in legislature have been compelled to support the Russian state in its policy directions even if they do quibble about some of the small issues. The state under Putin has a high degree of control over all elements of society, and these structures that enable control will remain unchanged so long as Putin remains, so it is unlikely they should go away when he dies. In short, it is likely that given the continuance of state power and geopolitical perspectives, things are unlikely to change. I do not particularly foresee a Carnation Revolution style upheaval is in the offing just yet, as the civil resistance is not powerful enough.",893bf9bf52b7c156d23b45825cb7d8aee1b87b6e,True,False,,,,,0,1645884231,,0,{},hyijnku,False,t3_sywaeb,False,True,t3_sywaeb,/r/geopolitics/comments/sywaeb/post_putin_russia/hyijnku/,1645884245,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1645855431.0,

Russia has focused on improving its anti-missile defense, to the point that the US outright recognizes its better then what the US has and the Pentagon (while condemning Turkey for buying the Russian system) actively discussed buying the system from Turkey for research purposes.

While its VERY unlikely said Missile defense system can stop Hypersonic missiles (as no one can yet) the US doesn't publically admit to having hyper sonic missile tech. 

Which given China, Russia and North Korea (likely through a gift from the other two) publicly have tested Hyper Sonic missiles, its very VERY likely if the US had them, they would admit it.

There is a notion that people are supposed to have a period of the roaring 20’s before beginning the 1930’s (and 1929); so there is a possibility that there will be a mass revolt of the people, independent of nation or leader, that could backfire on the dictators or authoritarian leaders. 

China declining to vote at the UN yesterday was telling, and after the economic damage caused by the pandemic and the massive amount of debt of many developed countries, the appetite for war and the fear of nuclear weapons, and the example of what can happen even in todays world by paranoid dictators could drive an impetus to de-concentrate power at the top.

&gt; This is also a time of opportunity for America. We will work to translate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity, and liberty. The U.S. national security strategy will be based on a distinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our values and our national interests. The aim of this strategy is to help make the world not just safer but better. Our goals on the path to progress are clear: political and economic freedom, peaceful relations with other states, and respect for human dignity.

&gt;And this path is not America’s alone. It is open to all. To achieve these goals, the United States will:

&gt;* champion aspirations for human dignity;
* strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent attacks against us and our friends;
* work with others to defuse regional conflicts;
* prevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our friends, with weapons of mass destruction;
* ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and free trade;
* **expand the circle of development by opening societies and building the infrastructure of democracy;**
* develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of global power; and
* transform America’s national security institutions to meet the challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century.

I will illustrate the highlighted point with a quote from his excellency the greatest foreign policy failure in history himself: ""As we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror, we must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens.""

It was a distinctly Kantian policy, the basic assumption was peace and prosperity will break out on the globe if only we proliferate democracy–*by force*.

Scott Morrison and the Liberals are riddled with faults and I'll be happy to see them voted out at the next election. The only good thing they have managed to achieve is to distance us from China which is steadily going authoritarian ever since Xi took power which obviously took place far before Scomo took the job of PM. They are clumsy as hell about it but it 100% needed to be done. 

China's expression of authoritarianism has been to militarise the South China Sea, assault Taiwanese diplomats in other countries, lock up over a million Uighurs in concentration camps, bribe Australian politicians, scale up espionage and hacking activities, then respond to inflicting a pandemic on the world by cutting off Australian trade and going out of their way to insult us. China wrecked its relationship over the last two years not just with Australia but - if you were actually paying attention - *with most of the world*. 

The analysis that it was Australia's current government who wrecked the relationship solely as an election tactic is infantile. The relationship first got rocked when Rudd called them ""rat f-ckers"" and Malcolm Turnbull said ""the Australian people have stood up"". This predates Morrison and Dutton's leadership by years.

Specifically, materials science and metallurgy. 

You mention semiconductors, which are critical for modern weapon systems, but really you can get pretty far without them. The Soviets never developed semiconductor technology for instance. The US likewise did the bulk of the space race, the Manhattan Project, supersonic aircraft, and nuclear-powered warships without reliance upon semiconductors. That said, both the US and USSR had robust materials science programs and advanced machining capabilities to produce the gadgets and gizmos that did those things and made them capable of performing. 

The PRC has only in the past year been able to produce a domestic fighter jet engine for its J-series aircraft. The engines they attempted to construct simply couldn't provide enough flight hours to allow the fleet to be able to be reliably used in any combat situation, and thus, the PRC had to purchase engines from Russia for its primary combat aircraft. Once you sit back and take that in, you pretty quickly start to see the issues with any apples-to-apples comparison between the PLA &amp; PLAN to the US military. Just in an equipment capability standpoint alone there appears to be a massive gap. Then once you figure in not only an untested force, but one without a real ""martial history.""

&gt;    I’m speaking from experience. I was on a Nimitz-class CVN for several years. DC shoring team captain for a full deployment as part of that time.

I have full respect for what people put into such service, im just saying the battlefield has permanently changed and such ships are going to be remnants from a previous age the moment a real power conflict breaks out. relying on people is the next weak link to remove and we are on the precipice of that reality on the battlefield. we arent there yet but the next truly big conflict will push that over the edge immediately in a lot of fields. pilots can only handle 9 g's.

im not denying service members are very good at what they do, im just saying that war changes quickly, naval warfare especially. wwi and wwii had massive leaps that left ships less than a decade old completely obsolete overnight. technological velocity has and will only increase.

 &gt;   Take the USS Cole. That ship took a hit to the waterline, in a maneuvering lineup, that left a hole nearly 10’ in diameter. The crew was able to keep the ship not only afloat, but returned her to combat readiness. That’s the sort of thing that is generational. It’s learned though blood.

sealing a few bulkheads and pumping water from one hole can be done, even a 10 foot hole. but what about 10 1' holes? what about 1000 1"" holes? even if the ship survives its crippled, and significantly more vulnerable, it doesnt matter much if the ship is destroyed or not as long as its not in the fight. all you need is a bunch of badass little charges that can breach 4-6 inches of steel and a delivery mechanism. one manta ray shaped uuv with a bunch of magnetic charges lying in wait, plops them all over the bottom of your hull. next gen sea mines.

a remora like uuv could drill into the hull a couple inches and place a super tiny bullet sized charge to blast it open, it could carry a shitload of very small charges that open up 1-6 inch holes. wait for the ship to be moving fast enough and drill slow enough that you couldnt detect it. hell you could even seal it so you couldnt see it on the surface without a close up inspection.

asymmetric warfare is how most fighting happens now, you dont meet your enemy head on out on the battlefield if you will lose a direct conflict. use their might against them, what would it cost to make a drill drone vs just sailing a carrier back to port for repair? then the time to repair it, cost, and time lost in the fight. that $10B carrier is super impressive but if its water logged and cant continue to fight or even get to the fight, does it matter?

sonar and ndt and blah blah, how do you detect a 1' robot fish from a real fish and the noise floor on a moving ship give enough leeway that i could literally make that for like $1-5k in volume. whats 10B/5k? 

&gt;    Other things that are not just “tonnage” is combined fleet operations; surface, air, and subsurface capability working in concert. Underway replenishment capacity. All these things are not built in the shipyard.

sure logistics wins large scale wars and drawn out conflicts, your troops pushing into enemy territory are useless if you cant feed, resupply, reinforce, and defend them. but the cost is where the asymmetric warfare shines.

if you need 10 ships worth of ammo and soldiers and food per day, and your enemy is taking out one ship per day, and you only have 100 ships which round trip takes 10 days. you are done. even if those ships survive and eventually get repaired.

nukes and 'mad' aside, there are few stretches of peace in the last century where taking 'modern' weapons back 10 or 20 years wouldn't guarantee you victory.

sorry for the drunken tangents, but im just saying weve offshored all of our manufacturing to china, they make basically all of the worlds electronics and the next large scale war will end being won by robots, so we need to bring some manufacturing back to the us before we can delude ourselves into thinking china cant be a serious threat because they have fewer or inferior 'modern' units.",95e355ab705096e50933e6926bdfd3fbdb3bb3ce,True,False,,,,,0,1645856917,,0,{},hyhhzho,False,t3_t16w9a,False,True,t1_hygx0ei,/r/geopolitics/comments/t16w9a/the_eurasian_nightmare_chineserussian_convergence/hyhhzho/,1645856932,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1645828117.0,

[],False,,Wanghaoping99,,,[],,,,text,t2_t6g13xr,False,False,"Quite likely. While the Taliban likes to hype up itself as a grassroots resistance like the Vietnamese Communists, there were many who opposed them even before they came into power. These ran the gamut from left-wing reformers to right-wing conservatives who were all put off by the Taliban's violent methods. The Taliban used their advantage in force to dominate Afghan politics, but there are still many who bear underlying resentment for them. It is true that the Taliban's rapid takeover was facilitated by the surrenders of many provincial authorities in exchange for clemency, but these were the result of an conscious strategy by the Taliban to cut off population centres by rapidly taking over the surrounding countryside to sever transportation nodes. With the governmental response turned piecemeal, the communities saw no realistic option for resistance and thus capitulated, but only out of expedience.  

Resistance occurred almost immediately after the Fall of Kabul, generally considered to be the end of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. On one hand you had holdouts from the Taliban's offensive. The Taliban had long been facing resistance in the Hazarajat, where the majority Shia population had previously faced persecution from the Pashtun-dominated Taliban. Although the Taliban had moved to include more minorities in its leadership, the Hazara were understandably still skeptical and in any case did not appreciate the iconoclastic fundamentalism. The Hazarajat is also rugged and arid even by Afghan standards, which made it difficult for the Taliban to comb through this area. The Taliban were also focusing on securing the Afghan Ring Road transport corridor, allowing resistance to endure. Reports suggest that some of the Hazarajat military units continued to fight back even after the Taliban took Kabul and negotiated surrenders with the provincial authorities. In short there were many fighters who did not accept the Taliban's rule, and looked for opportunities to fight back.

One cannot discuss the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan without bringing up the Taliban's religious enemies. While the Islamic State's Khorasan Province(IS-KP) is the most notorious of them, there are also other radicalised groups whose allegiance are uncertain. Despite what the Taliban want you to think, they are not a cohesive hierarchical organisation like the CPC or United Russia. They are decentralised, with local units having a great amount of leeway to act on their own prerogative, which addressed the potential obliteration of the command structure by a technologically superior force. Moreover, on a macro level there are different interest groups within the Taliban that seek to fulfill their own desires by wielding their independent sets of followers, even while operating under the umbrella of the Taliban. The most overt of these is the Haqqani Network, which actually pre-dates the formation of the Taliban by decades. They serve to obtain resources through their own connections from Pakistan, rendering them indispensable to the Taliban. This leverage has gotten them as far as ministerial positions in the Taliban government. Other heavyweights include Abdul Ghani Baradar, co-founder of the Taliban, and Mullah Ishaqzai, head of the Qatar diplomatic office. In fact, much of the official Taliban leadership exists as a compromise between the various power bases within the larger organisation.  

What this ultimately means is that Taliban leaders have distinct followings that they can use for their own interests. And sometimes these interests include breaking away. Disgruntled Taliban commanders have formed splinter factions, including the Mullah Daudullah Front. Many of the original members of IS-KP were also disillusioned Taliban fighters who accepted the oversight of IS. The decentralisation initiates and facilitates the growth of these splinter factions, many of whom desire the destruction of the main Taliban group. While the status of many splinter factions is unclear following years of Taliban attacks, we know that IS-KP is still at large. They have instigated many brutal attacks across Afghanistan, including bombing the gateway to Kabul's airport to send a message to the evacuating Americans . In another instance they dispatched an Uighur suicide bomber to massacre a Shia mosque, using the occasion to critique the Taliban for their inaction against China's actions in Xinjiang (in fact some claim that the Taliban might be deporting Uighur refugees back to China to curry favour with Beijing.). The key is to undermine the functioning and support for the already very controversial government, which could foment instability to the benefit of IS-KP. Rebellion would weaken the Taliban's hold, providing IS the opportunity to expand at the expense of the more secular insurrectionists. Hence at the very minimum we know that IS-KP continues to conspire even now to undermine the Taliban. 

We also hear of isolated armed uprisings by local militia groups. The most overt of this was the Panjshir conflict, where the old National Front authorities declared a new provisional government for the whole of Afghanistan. There was a lot of continuity in this conflict from the old Afghan-Taliban fighting. The National Front comprised of forces from the old Northern Alliance at the end of the Afghan civil war, involving several warlords from the ethnic minorities of the north. At this point however, the Dostums had fled abroad after their failure to defend Mazar-i-Sharif. Other political leaders had either fled or been detained by the Taliban. This left Ahmad Massoud undisputedly the leader of the organisation, though in fairness he had always been supreme in the Panjshir, the last area not contested by the Taliban. The region became a haven for withdrawing Afghan military units, which gave it a pan-national support base transcending ethnic divides. Massoud lucked out even more when Amrullah Saleh, former VP, sought refuge there as well. Saleh declared that with Ghani out of the picture, he was the rightful president of Afghanistan, setting up a shadow government in Panjshir. Since Massoud was already the guarantor of Saleh's safety, the two partnered up to form the National Resistance Front, which claimed to be an umbrella group for the remnants of anti-Taliban resistance, including the vestiges of the former armed forces.",dbf6090d2233ac5ef98729113fb2a1c56ae5a578,True,False,,,,,0,1645856510,,0,{},hyhhcuk,False,t3_sujq2u,False,True,t3_sujq2u,/r/geopolitics/comments/sujq2u/how_likely_are_there_conspirators_in_afghanistan/hyhhcuk/,1645856528,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1645827710.0,

At the same time, europeans response would be the same, just different countries saying the same things. UK gets 5% of their gas from Russia. Spain gets a 9%.

In that inverted world, the UK and Spain would be the nazi, russian lapdogs while Germany and Italy would be highly praised by those who want to confront Russia, no matter the cost.

[],False,,PausedForVolatility,,,[],,,,text,t2_55x96iwp,False,False,"Ah, international legalese. Got to love it. This will somewhat simplified. 

Technically, only countries can recognize other countries. When does a polity that controls a given territory become a country? When it's recognized by other countries. How do those countries become countries? When they're recognized by other countries. If you've noticed that this is a circular, unhelpful definition... well, it is.

Once a country is recognized by a vague and ill-defined number of other countries and thus has something approximating legitimacy on the international stage, it applies to be a UN member. As part of that application it pledges to abide by the UN charter (you know -- resolve disputes peacefully, uphold international peace and stability, etc.). Then the UN Security Council essentially vets the application. If it doesn't get vetoed by the US, UK, PRC, France, or Russia, it gets put to a vote. If it passes the vote there, it then gets referred to the UN General Assembly. They then vote on it and, by simple majority, decide if this country should have a UN seat.

It gets more complicated at various points in time because some polities **don't** want UN recognition. The Vatican, for instance, doesn't want to be a UN member because that requires agreeing to the UN charter, which would put the Vatican under the nominal authority of a secular power, which would imply the Pope (who, in political terms, is essentially an absolute monarch of a theocratic state) is in some way beholden to a secular power. Since that doesn't work with Papal doctrine, the Vatican doesn't seek a UN seat. It does have an observer. (Observers are... observers. For once, the word means what it means.)

So back to your question about Afghanistan. When does the party that was previously the opposition and is now in control of the country get recognized as the legitimate government of Afghanistan? When enough countries recognize it was the ""legitimate successor"" of the government it toppled. 

The Taliban have thus far failed to find support for their claim that they're the ""legitimate successor"" of the last government and thus should be recognized. They, uh, appear frustrated by this. I think that they expected prompt recognition once they seized Kabul. 

They've since reached out to China and asked for help securing recognition.

As we've seen with something as decidedly non-military as Russia's involvement in the SWIFT system, opinions (like Germany's) can change in a relatively short period of time. 

I think it's likely that if Poland were to involve itself in this conflict like that, without the approval of the rest of NATO or the UNSC, it's pretty likely that at least some members of NATO would make the case that unilateral deployments don't fall under the umbrella of collective defense. Some would probably argue that deployments out of sovereign territory of the nations in question would render it ineligible for common defense (Article 5 wasn't invoked during missions in the Balkans, for instance). Some would probably argue that unilateral (or bilateral, if Ukraine requests it) involvement is inconsistent with Article 1's mission statement and thus wouldn't apply.

I imagine there'd be a ton of interpretation of the language and that this ambiguity would get... messy.

Crimea would still have been made 'part of Russia' under such an agreement so the Ukrainian public ON THE WHOLE would have moved to be more anti Russian (Less pro Russian voters and in the non Pro Russian regions, less respect for Russia overall).

Even if that wasn't the case, these pro Russian regions don't have the numbers to stop Zelenskyy. He won the first round of voting by 30% of the vote (Which was almost double second place who got 16% and actually double 3rd who got 13%), and the second round by 70%.

Meanwhile the Anexed regions (Crimea and Dombas) held 12% of eligible voters in the Ukrainian election, and the election had a turnout of 50%. Even if 100% of the Anexxed regions had voted (unlikely), somehow had knowledge of the results of the election before hand, and voted perfectly to try and defeat Zelenskyy (So as soon as the person in second gets 1 vote ahead of Zelenskyy they all start voting for the guy in third)...

They would be 1.7 million votes short of pushing Zelenskyy into 3rd place and thus not eligible for the Runoff election.

The only way to prevent Zelenskyy's rise would be prevent the popularist sentiment in Ukraine from turning anti-Russian. This would have required Putin changing his Ukrainian strategy in the 90s to target the voters rather then the politicians.

As a side note, I see Peter Zeihan's arguments echoing a lot in here. In 2010, Zeihan predicted China would collapse within 10 years. He's done it again in 2020.

I do think China has found an effective way to increase their assabiya, and it's different to the western way. So analyzing things just with a westernised angle will lead to gross mispredictions such as Zeihan's.

In my opinion, I don't see China becoming a hegemon simply because that would require the US to collapse, which I see as extremely unlikely. But it is almost a given that the world will be multi polar: the US, China, the EU and India would be the main blocks in the bingo. There is always the chance that the US keeps paralyzed in a bipartisan conflict, China has a demographic crises, India and EU break up.

But overall, the US seeks to democratize the world. However, this is a long term, strategic objective. On a tactical basis, sometimes the direct path is not the surest path. The US often did not support democratization in countries where the prevailing mood of the populace would have, at least in the immediate term, put that country at odds with key US interests. 

In South Korea, stability and anti-Communism were more important than democracy during the Cold War. This makes sense to me. SK was a key bulkhead against the Soviets and Chinese in East Asia. The US set up a democratic constitution there. It encouraged democracy, or sometimes at least just human rights, when it could. But it often found itself in agreement with the coup leaders or dictators that the democracy was not working or stable. Similarly, the US is reticent to support democracies where the popular vote leans towards say Islamic fundamentalism, etc.

Not only the experience from WW2, but the flight deck fire on the USS Forestal is taught to every sailor from boot camp to the ship. Additionally, the nuclear testing we performed on warships in the S. Pacific is simply unable to be replicated. It was extremely informative to naval engineers though. 

Take the USS Cole. That ship took a hit to the waterline, in a maneuvering lineup, that left a hole nearly 10’ in diameter. The crew was able to keep the ship not only afloat, but returned her to combat readiness. That’s the sort of thing that is generational. It’s learned though blood.

Making thousands less in a year does impact my quality of life. If I am unlikely to make 6-figures because our economy is tightening due to less growth, then that impacts my quality of life.

&gt; Why not? Skilled workers benefit the most from globalization because they're not necessarily tied down to one country. 

I only know one language, and the only other one that I will learn is Japanese. I have no time to learn anything else. I will not benefit from being able to work anywhere as few countries even have loose immigration laws, and I will not be able to communicate with them.

&gt; China being an economic hegemon 

I don't see how this will actually happen (although it depends on how you are using that word). This isn't going to be the 1400's where they are an actual outright hegemon with 40% of global GDP. I assume they will be a regional one and Asia as a whole will be the gravity well of the planet. I am more worried about the collapse of the West more than China being an outright global power  with some vast blue-water navy akin to the modern US (but I think they will gladly accelerate our downfall by being the regional hegemon of the gravity well). It's more proper Asia as a whole is going to be the hegemon while us Westerners will return to the Dark Ages. 

&gt; America has been steadily losing power from it's peak in the 50s but overall salaries and wealth has just been increasing.

Fair enough.

&gt; Regardless of how much Asian or Africa rises, the West is still benefiting from its past colonization efforts (despite it already ending). 

Sure but for how long? 

&gt; Ok if you really want to teach English, my previous points about America's soft power remain. 

Japanese learn English for social standing. They never use it, it's entirely a social status objective. English, as social status, appears to connect far more with the US being the wealthiest power in the world with strong economic ties to Japan, not because Japanese care about American movies.

&gt; Why are weebs weebs? It's not because Japan is a hegemon, it's rather because they have super good soft power.

Again, Japan's interest in English is social status, not Hollywood. Once China absorbs Japan into its sphere of influence, I do not see why any Japanese would care about English.",c6840daeb1f08832f5288e4fbedd9f6e3aefd612,True,False,,,,,0,1645837925,,0,{},hyghd3l,False,t3_t16w9a,False,True,t1_hygche3,/r/geopolitics/comments/t16w9a/the_eurasian_nightmare_chineserussian_convergence/hyghd3l/,1645837941,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1645809125.0,

[],False,,ouaisjeparlechinois,,,[],,,,text,t2_dboe9zrj,False,False,"&gt;I care more about sheer wealth. While I know many Redditors believe those qualities (universal X, Y, and Z), are very important, I consider my ability to make more money important. With the US as the center of the globe, with massive wealth, I can earn a lot. I won't be able to earn much once it goes backwards.

We should make a clarification here. Sheer wealth, ability to make money, and quality of life are not the same. If your wealth goes down $1,000, it probably wouldn't impact your quality of life in any way. 

So which one is more important? Quality of life of ability to make money or sheer wealth?

&gt; I won't be able to earn much once it goes backwards.

Why not? Skilled workers benefit the most from globalization because they're not necessarily tied down to one country. You can earn a lot regardless of where you go and China being an economic hegemon (which is the most likely scenario) won't change that.

America has been steadily losing power from it's peak in the 50s but overall salaries and wealth has just been increasing.

&gt;It's a certain far-left argument that the West only had those things due to the wealth they stole from the Americas (and eventually Asia and Africa). Without this, they would have remained a relative backwater. 

I can see that explanation working for the Industrial Revolution and the past but I don't really see it's applicability for the present.

Regardless of how much Asian or Africa rises, the West is still benefiting from its past colonization efforts (despite it already ending). Just because America becomes slightly less important doesn't mean that Hollywood will become a backwater, nor will Silicon Valley become a backwater.

This is more specific to the US but as a Taiwanese immigrant to the US, I truly believe the US is an nation of immigrants. So yeah, maybe America becomes less important than it used to be but people will always immigrate to America because no other powerful country allows such diverse immigration (China, Korea, and Japan as I'm sure you know don't have that advantage and don't want to offer it either)

&gt;and English teacher is far less taxing.

Ok if you really want to teach English, my previous points about America's soft power remain. People want to learn languages not just because it's the language of the hegemon. People learn languages to understand their favorite films, dramas, music, comics, etc. And America's soft power is unlikely to fade regardless of America's hegemonic power because the two are not connected.

Again, Hollywood isn't going to be less important just because the US isn't the hegemon.

&gt;Hegemons often come with the soft power of their neighbors considering the hegemon's language as the lingua franca. 

The hegemon's language is not always the lingua franca, just look at how French continued being lingua franca even after the fall of the French hegemon centuries ago.

Why are weebs weebs? It's not because Japan is a hegemon, it's rather because they have super good soft power.

Put another way, overall hegemony does not imply hegemony in every aspect. The US was able to accomplish that but it's unlikely China can do that (for various reasons). So even if China becomes an overall hegemon, the US is likely to stay the cultural hegemon and your English job will remain safe.",3a39e348c3b268bc237c5340c287d717cac64bff,True,False,,,,,0,1645835663,,0,{},hygche3,False,t3_t16w9a,False,True,t1_hyg4lfu,/r/geopolitics/comments/t16w9a/the_eurasian_nightmare_chineserussian_convergence/hygche3/,1645835677,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1645806863.0,
