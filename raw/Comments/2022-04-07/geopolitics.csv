[],False,,Rent_A_Cloud,,,,,,"I'm sorry, but what you're saying here skips too much history that is directly related to the state of the world as we know it.

First of all, colonization lasted into the 20th century, we aren't talking 1687 here, this is recent history. 

Enlightenment started officially in Europe, but it's not like Europe is the starting point of innovation. Take gunpowder weapons for instance. The middle east was using them before Europe, people tend to overlook that the middle east was for quite a period of time more advanced than Europe and that European civilization profited from novel ideas and technologies thought up and invented outside of Europe before the discovery of the Americas. Arabic numerals are another example (they actually  come from India i believe). European culture and knowledge did, in fact, not come into being in a vacuum.

To this day, Europe is not bringing technology to colonies, by far most technological devices in for example Afrika are second hand leftovers from European society, often imported by locals with contacts in the west, most people in third world countries can't afford technologies that we think of as cheap. 

As for civilization, what is ""modern"" civilization? Europe did it's darndest to export European culture around the world, often with a side note of cultural genocide. Modern civilization for third world countries means a civilization where in largely foreign corporations manipulate governments and exploit local resources for a pittance (often with the help of elements in politics both there and here). That is part of modern civilization in a lot of countries.

Why should western companies manipulating foreign nations not be seen as the west rigging the world stage to western advantage? In my opinion that's exactly what it is. And let it be clear that it's not that they ""did"" shady stuff, they ""do"" shady stuff.

Capitalism does not work with long term game plans, that should be clear at a glance. But besides that when a country like Grenada for example tries to nationalize it's resources and thus oust foreign influence, what happens? Well in the case of Grenada the US invaded. That's one example of many in which a government gets overthrown by, or with help from, western powers to maintain western supremacy. (The USSR are also good at that, and CCP now also but not as God as Europe)

As for funneling money into those countries, when looking at their resources and its exploitation there have now been centuries of funneling wealth OUT of the third world. Simply stopping to do that would go a long way

I could go on and on, but honestly I advice you to do some reading on the subject. A good starting point may be [Silk Road: A new history of the world by Peter Frankopan](https://www.adlibris.com/se/bok/the-silk-roads-a-new-history-of-the-world-9781101912379?gclid=Cj0KCQjwl7qSBhD-ARIsACvV1X1jGYa51vzZJ8ZC8A9HXIoGo4tOgz0ktpeg9xJrt2uGWV4uclrxRigaAoGzEALw_wcB)

The idea was to keep the nations under your influence, with corrupt leaders so that the natural resources could be redirected to either the first or second worlds, where they would reap the benefits of manufacturing and processing to create wealth, while preventing these wealth-adding industries from emerging within the nations themselves.   


We've seen a dramatic shift since the end of the cold war, were the ""Third world"" has been most impacted by China's growth.   


Now, the strategy has changed. Instead of exploiting the natural resources of 'third world' countries, it's about developing them to suit your country's needs and gaining ownership over their key industries through investment and political-economic bullying.   


The USA and China want to set up their client states into countries that are economically dependent, allow foreign ownership of their industries/infrastructure, and would fall apart if they attempted to change spheres of influence or elected leadership that their sponsor state doesn't approve of.   


The 'Washington Consensus' vs 'Beijing Consensus' has replaced the cold war's race for natural resource exploitation. Personally, I think this 'world order' is slightly better (I think the Beijing consensus focusing on the development of infrastructure is better for nations overall, but they're certainly not doing it altruistically).",6c902eac7e13445a813ccd3f7f67beb967fdde73,True,False,,,,,0,1649368110,,0,{},i3tgs9j,False,t3_ty3jjv,False,True,t3_ty3jjv,/r/geopolitics/comments/ty3jjv/is_the_current_world_order_rigged_against_third/i3tgs9j/,1649368122,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649339310.0,[],text,t2_6mjxmkhy,False,False,

&gt;But prior to the isolationist state, we can see America's diplomatic heft again with the League of Nations and most notably with Wilson's influence at the Treaty of Versailles negotiations.

I actually think that American influence at Versailles is rather overrated. The UK and France were the two most important players there, and the US was unable to convince them to adhere to his 14 points plan, much to the chagrin of Germany. The points he was most successful at obtaining were those that the British already supported, and the League of Nations was really they only loftier goal that was achieved—which the US then refused to join.

&gt;that doesn't remove the imperialist aspects of those situations

Agreed.

&gt;I disagree with this assessment because if they really thought they had to deal with the government, they would have included the government of China in the Open Door negotiations but that didn't happen. The Open Door Policy was proposed and agreed upon without the consent or input of the Chinese government.
Rather they realized China's market (one. The Chinese people) would be the most profitable pareto-efficient situation for all imperialist powers involved.

I don't think that the Eight-Powers were *respecting* the Qing in any way, I just think they decided that governing the Chinese directly themselves would be a massive mistake. Perhaps they considered Chinese self-government a necessary evil, but my point is merely that they had to acknowledge the reality of the situation. It was still imperialistic, but they realized their goals could not be as lofty as they had hoped in the previous decade. I call this progress in favor of China, albeit only the beginnings of it.

&gt;Most academics consider the Boxer Protocol to be part of the series of unequal treaties because it was made, again I emphasize, without the consent of any Chinese actor.

You are correct, but it's usually considered the last one effecting the Han regions of China that involved Europeans. The British were still interfering in Tibet, but I consider the Boxer Protocol to be a tacit acknowledgement that Europeans couldn't do much more to interfere in the core of China than they had up to that point. To be sure it was unequal, but I think it was also showed the limit of what westerners could press on to China.

To put it another way: I think the aftermath First Sino-Japanese War was the lowest point for China. Things still had a long ways to go after the Boxer Rebellion, but it was in some ways an improvement.

&gt;I disagree with that assessment though. The US stepping in to help China (which is obviously good, props to the US) is not connected with this Open Door Policy at all. 

I'm connecting a chain of events over 40 years. The US protested Russian interference in Manchuria after the Boxer Rebellion as a violation of the Open Door Policy, and raised similar objections to Japan when they replaced Russia there in 1905. For the same reason, the US vigorously opposed the 21 Demands that Japan made in 1915. More and more situations like Shandong put the US and China in the same corner against Japan, and a lot of good faith began to develop between the two countries. Racist sentiment in the US of course was an issue too, but because of Japanese attempts to circumvent the Open Door Policy, the US support of China against Japan grew stronger over the decades.

&gt;They weren't going to do anything until Pearl Harbor.

The US was not intending to go to war with Japan, but support for China is why Pearl Harbor happened in the first place. The US, like many countries, mostly disarmed in the 1920s. When the Manchurian Incident happened in 1931, the US protested, but at the time the US Army was only about 150,000 strong. The Neutrality Acts also hampered American ability to respond to many of the cascading events of the 1930s.

When Japan invaded in 1937, the Roosevelt cheated the Neutrality Act to keep supplying China with weapons (the war was not formally declared), and instituted embargoes on various products that eventually resulted in the oil embargo that spurred the Pearl Harbor attack.",1a5423a3d4c2ebdaf9516670daa85dd62faf9cab,True,False,,,,,0,1649364835,,0,{},i3t8sc0,False,t3_txmq2k,False,True,t1_i3rqnmp,/r/geopolitics/comments/txmq2k/the_price_of_hegemony_can_america_learn_to_use/i3t8sc0/,1649364848,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649336035.0,[],text,t2_32d1pm2y,False,False,

Oryx isn't an exact source of information but many of those tanks are just immobilised or abandoned, they aren't completely destroyed (i.e you can't just go 450 multiplied by X crew = Y casualties). Additionally, the Ukrainians and Russians use the same tanks and armoured vehicles, and they've been many cases of confusing one for the other.

Many units were rotated through the US Middle East conflicts so there are plenty of soldiers spread around with combat experience and the overall training is at quite high level since there’s no conscription and acquisition of new tech is harder than investing into training the small force. 

All of this revolves around the idea that none of these countries will fight alone and that the US/France/UK (or Germany of late) would provide the main forces for any potential conflict - as they have in the past.

Showing that without the US that this agreement wouldn't have occurred.

&gt;The European powers accepted this because they had decided that war over Chinese commerce was not worthwhile. If say Germany or France had opposed the US, I'm not sure what the US could have done.

Being a superpower does not mean that you can force everyone to do everything you want them to. I mean just look at China and the US right now. The US is undeniably a superpower but it cannot force China to act in a way that the US would like.

&gt;WWI was closer to a ""prove it"" moment for the US, but because the war ended so quickly, and the US returned to an isolationist policy,

But prior to the isolationist state, we can see America's diplomatic heft again with the League of Nations and most notably with Wilson's influence at the Treaty of Versailles negotiations.

&gt;Regardless, I think the Spanish-American War was probably a more significant early showing for the US than the Boxer Rebellion.

Oh yeah absolutely, would agree with that. But my point is that by the Boxer Rebellion, indeed by the 20s, the US was considered as a superpower. Definitely not the sole superpower but definitely ""a"" super power.

&gt;China was already under a great deal of foreign influence in 1900, and the Boxer Rebellion really didn't change much in that regard. The treaty was fairly favorable to China, especially given that they technically lost.

Just because the extent of subjugation is not changed does not negate the fact that these colonial/imperialist (pick your poison) powers used military force to *reinforce* the existing subjugation of China by such colonial forces.

Just because it was ""beneficial"" does not negate the colonial/imperialist aspects of the situation. Colonial powers ""benefited"" Singapore and India and plenty of African countries but that doesn't remove the imperialist aspects of those situations.

&gt;meaning that they needed to deal with the government of China rather than trying to influence the Chinese people.

I disagree with this assessment because if they really thought they had to deal with the government, they would have included the government of China in the Open Door negotiations but that didn't happen. The Open Door Policy was proposed and agreed upon without the consent or input of the Chinese government.

Rather they realized China's market (one. The Chinese people) would be the most profitable pareto-efficient situation for all imperialist powers involved. 

&gt;China did lose Manchuria over it, but the US opposed both Russia's and Japan's presence there. 

That I don't think we can blame on the Alliance as that was done decades later by individual countries. 

America did oppose the Japanese invasion so good for them.

&gt;That's all true, but I think it was important that China was not dismembered the way Africa had been, or India prior to the British gaining full control. The Chinese government of course had much more history than any of those regions, but I think the Boxer Protocol was an important step in ending the era of Unequal Treaties. Without it, I think foreign powers would have exploited the 1911 revolution and subsequent internal issues in China much more readily.

Most academics consider the Boxer Protocol to be part of the series of unequal treaties because it was made, again I emphasize, without the consent of any Chinese actor.

And regardless of this Protocol, foreign powers did try to exploit the 1911 revolution in China for their own benefit (just see Xinjiang or Tibet).

&gt;evolution of US policy that culminated in Japan's 1945 defeat, which finally freed China from foreign influence entirely. 

I disagree with that assessment though. The US stepping in to help China (which is obviously good, props to the US) is not connected with this Open Door Policy at all.

I take issue with the framing of the sanctions and the lack of consistency. 

In terms of framing, the sanctions are being applied like a punishment designed to inflict pain, not correct rogue behavior. This is especially galling considering that American/NATO military hardware in Ukraine was known to be a redline issue for Russia long before the invasion. [Obama admin refused to send arms to Ukraine citing a risk of provoking a major war with Russia](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/12/world/europe/defying-obama-many-in-congress-press-to-arm-ukraine.html) so this is not some fringe theory. Russia is culpable for invading, but they didn't invade because Putin took a fancy to it one day. 

The sanctions are framed as a type of financial siege warfare by which Russia will be 'starved' into submission regardless of whether Russia ends the invasion. 

In terms of practical implementations of the sanctions, there are huge problems and inconsistencies. For one, Europe still buys billions/week of Russian energy. In this context, the US then threatens [China](https://www.reuters.com/world/us-says-china-could-face-sanctions-if-it-supports-russias-war-ukraine-2022-04-06/) and [India](https://www.indiatimes.com/explainers/news/caatsa-sanctions-will-us-punish-india-for-s-400-deal-with-russia-566157.html) with sanctions targeted at them if they help Russia economically.

It's clear that the international playing field is more tilted than ever in favor of the West. 

If the sanctions were intended to encourage Russia to end the war, they should be coupled with significant diplomatic outreach and specific conditions on which sanctions could start to be lifted. Instead, the US state department has not tried even once to engage Russia diplomatically since the sanctions started. There are no clear conditions on when the sanctions would be lifted. The closes we have to that is a vague call from the sitting US president for a regime change in Russia.

In addition, the sanctions feel unjust and hypocritical to every country that has been on the receiving end of Western Neo-colonialism in the past century, which is almost the entire global south.

No doubt they would've preferred a fast resolution but it's myopic to think that they wouldn't have planned for a drawn out conflict. 

&gt;Hence all the nonsense about ""denazification""

It's not nonsense at all, which is why they've been so determined to snuff out Azov in Mariupol. Putin specifically mentioned the conflagration in Odessa in his invasion commencement speech and went as far as saying that they knew the names of all the perpetrators and were coming for them. It's a mistake to discount the indelible effect that Barbarossa has made on the Russian psyche. Their country was almost annihilated by the Nazis, with some 27 million killed. It's a personal vendetta for them that this abhorrent ideology is gaining traction on their doorstep. I would concede that 'denazification' is lower down their list of strategic priorities but it's still important to them.

&gt;aka regime change.

I'm not convinced that this is a priority. The Russians would know where Zelenskyy has been every step of the way but they've made no substantive move against him (i.e cruise missile etc.) Ukraine is thoroughly penetrated by Russian intelligence, if they wanted him gone they could've struck him prior to the invasion. In fact it could be in their interest to keep him alive, as he would be crucial to validating the terms of the 'peace treaty' once it's finalised. There's every reason to believe that a successive puppet government would lead to insurgency etc.

&gt;The brunt of Russian forces, including some of their best equipment, was in the Northern area (not just around Kiev) from which they now withdrew from

Untrue, the bulk of their forces are in the East and South East.

&gt;it is surprising it took them so long to realize they don't have the forces to commit to a siege of Kiev 

They knew this from the outset. The Northern push was a shaping manoeuvre, nothing more.

&gt;Considering the high losses Russia has sustained to its fighting forces (which isn't easy to replace) its failure to capture the north and cut Ukrainian supply lines there

ISW is run by UK and US intelligence and isn't a reliable source of information. The losses as reported by Russian MOD are fairly minimal considering the campaign is close to completion.

&gt;Instead concentrate its remaining forces on encirclement of the heavily fortified Donbas area in the east, where the terrain is more favorable than in the north.

I agree with this, as the East has always been where the real battle lays. Once the Ukrainian army surrenders (or is destroyed) then they have the option of re-deploying to Kiev, Odessa etc. at leisure. 

My hunch is that the Ukrainians will come to terms after the Donbas campaign is concluded by we'll see.",2a4729d8d8a7130512487d9f485f2208f3428a79,True,False,,,,,0,1649323569,,0,{},i3qpo4f,False,t3_t0cgvt,False,True,t1_i3qng2g,/r/geopolitics/comments/t0cgvt/ukraine_megathread_all_new_posts_go_here_so_long/i3qpo4f/,1649323585,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649294769.0,[],text,t2_17k6gu,False,False,

In particular airborne and commando units of Poland and some of the Baltics are held in very high regard by US/UK soldiers who have worked together with them on joint missions / exercises. 

Another factor is that in recent decades British and French forces have mostly trained for wars abroad. But the East Europeans have trained with the looming threat of the Russians next door. No East European ever truly believed the Russian threat to be minimal because whatever agreement was signed (this is different from the Soviet nostalgia that some older folks in the Eastern countries had/have). Only the Western Europeans and Americans believed their deals with the Soviets/Russians held water. The point is specialized East European units are often more ""motivated"" than their American counterparts.

[],False,,EqualContact,,,,,,"&gt;But they were the ones that had enough diplomatic heft to successfully broker the Open Door policy. ""Major player"" is not simply judged by military investment in a certain military conflict.

That's fair, but the Open Door Policy really originated with the British, the US just insisted that everyone else be treated the same way. The European powers accepted this because they had decided that war over Chinese commerce was not worthwhile. If say Germany or France had opposed the US, I'm not sure what the US could have done. Similar to the Monroe Doctrine, the ability of the US to enforce such policy against Europe was still questionable.

&gt;One only has to refer to WWI to see how other country's viewed America's rising superpower status.

WWI was closer to a ""prove it"" moment for the US, but because the war ended so quickly, and the US returned to an isolationist policy, I'm not sure that the US was yet considered the equal of France of the UK in the minds of most people. The US was of course predicted by many to achieve Great Power status due to their population and industry, but people had made similar predictions about Russia that had yet to pan out.

Regardless, I think the Spanish-American War was probably a more significant early showing for the US than the Boxer Rebellion.

&gt;What else would you describe it as?

China was already under a great deal of foreign influence in 1900, and the Boxer Rebellion really didn't change much in that regard. The treaty was fairly favorable to China, especially given that they technically lost. It was I think a turning point for European ambitions because they realized that Chinese opposition to foreign influence was not something they would be capable of overcoming as they had in other parts of the world, meaning that they needed to deal with the government of China rather than trying to influence the Chinese people. Plus the Chinese also proved competent enough at combat to give the western nations some pause about what a future war would cost. Historians also are divided on whether or not the Boxers succeeding would have been a positive or negative thing for China in the longterm.

China did lose Manchuria over it, but the US opposed both Russia's and Japan's presence there. 

&gt;Very debatable. This agreement was proposed and agreed upon between Western countries, without the input of China at all (first sign that the agreement is not about recognizing China's sov). It ended territorial colonial ambitions but rather because the diplomatic negotiations helped the European powers recognize that they had more to gain by exploiting China's economy and market rather than land.

That's all true, but I think it was important that China was not dismembered the way Africa had been, or India prior to the British gaining full control. The Chinese government of course had much more history than any of those regions, but I think the Boxer Protocol was an important step in ending the era of Unequal Treaties. Without it, I think foreign powers would have exploited the 1911 revolution and subsequent internal issues in China much more readily.

&gt;That's the whole part of the Open Door policy so that the US would not be at a disadvantage when they came to China's market.

True, but it did eventually lead to an evolution of US policy that culminated in Japan's 1945 defeat, which finally freed China from foreign influence entirely. 

Don't mistake me for saying that the US was acting altruistically—they were not. I do think that China and the US's mutual issues with Japan eventually worked out well for China, but that was more good fortune than anything else.",dcefbf7ae7568e4ce7cef263ab467b984036bcf4,True,False,,,,,0,1649311598,,0,{},i3qax8h,False,t3_txmq2k,False,True,t1_i3oipds,/r/geopolitics/comments/txmq2k/the_price_of_hegemony_can_america_learn_to_use/i3qax8h/,1649311611,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649282798.0,[],text,t2_32d1pm2y,False,False,

Additionally, if they were serious about taking Kiev they would've cut the power, water, etc. and laid siege to the city which they haven't done.

GDP per capita in US 1990 dollars (http://www.worldeconomics.com/Data/MadisonHistoricalGDP/Madison%20Historical%20GDP%20Data.efp) for several African countries:

Especially after the Trump’s presidency, we have now seen rise to a new voting bloc. That being of the American Populists, who advocate for Trump’s “America First” policies. This new bloc has also become America’s single largest bloc and has now caused a restructuring in the Republican Party.

This is simply due to the fact that no other country has navy powerful enough to ensure the safety of the global trade routes. However, this system is, by in large a detriment to the US. The only reason why this global order was created in the first place was to combat the Soviet Union, a country that no longer exist.

I agree that it is directed at the ""West"" but disagree that it is specifically aimed at the US. It may appear like that because the US is the undisputed leader of the West but I think more evidence points to the rhetoric lacking a specific country that it attacks. And that's not rare for rhetoric to be like that. I think you could draw a link between Century of Humiliation rhetoric with general anti-impérialist rhetoric in general, some of which is directed against America (due to for example actions in the Middle East or Latin America, but the link for that argument is quite weak.

That's not to say that Chinese netizens don't attack the US because of course they do(just look at them parroting Mearsheimer's NATO explanation). I just don't think the evidence supports the contention that this idea is used against the US specifically.

&gt;In fact, a few posts above, a comment references the US incorrectly subjugating China as if the US was a major player or contributor to anything with the Boxer Rebellion.

Sure but there's an important difference between that commentator and how Chinese scholars and netizens commonly use it. 

The guy is using the Boxer Rebellion to prove America's ascendant super power status.

Chinese netizens use it to explain how America is culpable and participated in colonial activities in China.

&gt;the concept of Chinese nationhood was largely a new concept, born with the wave of nationalism during the early 1900s 

Just because the Chinese nation started in the early 1900s doesn't mean that China the empire wasn't humiliated by colonial powers. 

&gt;then you need to at least define what that means.

Colonial powers having their way with China without regard for China's sovereignty. Summer Palace being destroyed is often an example of that.

&gt;Or at least who was being humiliated.

China who at the time was represented by the Qing Dynasty. And yes, the vast majority of Chinese ppl and academics recognize the Qing as Chinese.

&gt;When the concept of the Century of Humiliation was invented, the Manchus who subjugated the Han were the foreigners and the imperialist invaders of China, literally.

No, by that time, the Manchus had assimilated into Han Chinese culture. That's one of the reasons why Manchus are not a big minority in China, unlike the Mongol-Chinese minority for example.

Manchus tried to be Chinese and assimilate into the pre-existing Ming Chinese bureaucracy and customs. While at first they may have been imperialists, by the time Europeans invaded, they considered themselves as Chinese (not ethnically but definitely as a Chinese citizen of dynasty)

&gt;Yet the Qing was the closest thing to a political entity that you could call the nation of China.

Because they were China at the time. They claimed to be Chinese and their subjects recognized the Qing as a Chinese dynasty (save for some Han nationalists).

&gt;because it is only retroactively that the Manchus were considered Chinese since that narrative now suits the CCP.

That's very very false. The Qing were considered as Chinese during their reign by the majority of their subjects. Just because some nationalists didn't agree with that doesn't negate the fact that the vast majority considered the Qing to be Chinese.

&gt;Century"" the time period of grievances actually had several decades of relative prosperity and peace and is arbitrarily defined without any real basis in history.

I mean you should understand that as a rhetorical device, the events described in the ""Century"" is not literally 100 years just like how the 100 years war was not 100 years. It just means a prolonged amount of colonial activity inflicted upon China.

And just because there was some prosperity and peace for a select group of people does not negate the humiliating aspects of foreign powers violating Chinese sovereignty.

&gt;In geopolitics, reducing and dismissing everything down to the lack of good intentions instead of end results or actions is really silly,

From an academic perspective you might look at everything from a consequentialist viewpoint but that completely ignores the human element that in fact *does* care about people's intentions, especially when it comes to issues like colonialism and imperialism.

I'm not trying to convince you their viewpoint is correct but to just correctly depicts their view point.

&gt;This is like saying the US wasn't really allies with the UK and France in WWII and didn't do a good thing in preventing the Axis from winning, but only did so because it didn't want Germany taking over the Europe and Japan from taking over the Pacific.

This is a false comparison. The US treated the French and British as equals in a racial sense whereas they did not do so with regard to the Chinese. This comparison completely neglects the fact that the US brokered a deal about Chinese sovereignty without the consent of the Chinese state.

That's not even considering how the British and French asked for US aid while the US brokering the Open Door deal was not asked for by the Chinese state and done *against* the will of the Chinese state.

That's a bit of a stretch about me given I said three sentences.

In the end, I just disagree. Even if we assume that 100% of foreign policy types come from Dupont Circle think tanks (not true), those think tanks vary wildly. If you think you're getting the same brand of academics from CAP (Obama) as you are from Heritage (Trump) then you're mistaken. Point being, ""think tank"" shouldn't be spoken of a single entity any more than ""politician"" should be.

Also, strategic foreign policy isn't dictated by think-tanks within or without the administration. It's dictated by the politicians and their friends, who treat Ambassador positions as thank you gifts to campaign contributors, and who generally tend to care more about votes than proper statesmanship. If we make an agreement, treaty, EO, or ""political commitment,"" the opposing administration is very likely to tear it up if they don't like it, possibly for no other reason than to deny the former administration a ""success.""
