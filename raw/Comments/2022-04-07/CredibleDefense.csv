A lot of it was written down and practiced even before WW2, like Deep Battle, with even more afterwards. Westerners have made entire careers learning about such things and then teaching them to other Americans, especially military, who are trying to understand how their enemy fights. 

Soviet/Russian fires centric approach really came to stride during WW2 and dominated their doctrine afterwards, becoming a cornerstone of their tactics and operational art. Their organization of units, heavy reliance on artillery, training exercises, and various combat experiences all confirmed it. FFS, they consider artillery a combat maneuver element, and I think that's pretty telling. 

The Germans can be said to have created the first IFV but it was a piece of shit, not standardized, not made in large numbers, and didn't change anything. As bad as the BMP-1 was and is to this day, at the time it was created it revolutionized mechanized ground warfare completely and totally, to the point EVERYONE copied the Soviet Union. 

Shock armies were an identified unit type during the Cold War meant to create the breakthroughs needed to then insert the Operational Maneuver Group. We had spies confirm this, we had post-Cold War copies of war plans (like the one courtesy of the Poles), and we had open archives for about a decade and a half that allowed western researchers to go in and find out on their own.

In [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/twtnw3/comment/i3kiaa6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) I wrote last week I jotted down just a small list of crazy shit they fucked up that was stuff they outright out to have known better on, that all point out with the billion other pieces of intel that they didn't actually think this invasion was going to be resisted. When that is the premise to the plan, and it backfires because they do resist (well), then yeah, the invading force ends up looking stupid.   

How about this. Forget analysts trying to understand the RuAF in Ukraine. During OP Desert Storm, nearly every US Army military maneuver commander from brigade level to CENTCOM thought they were going to take at least 20% casualties across the board. The ONLY senior leader who was optimistic was Barry McCaffrey of the 24th ID, who was saying beforehand that we were overestimating the Iraqis, underestimating ourselves, etc. Nobody predicted the ground war would last only 100 hours and end with one of the most one sided ground campaigns in history. 

Or lets talk OIF 2003. Command and staff within the US military, mostly Army and Marine senior brass, made all sorts of pessimistic predictions about how bad the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 was going to go down. While the Bush Administration was telling everyone in CENTCOM ""Don't worry, they wont fight back,"" the US military was stressing the fuck out because what if they did? They went in outright believing that they were going to get nailed by a massive chemical weapon attack at the Karbala Gap, because CENTCOM got it in their heads that was the obvious trigger area. They also believed beforehand and during the initial invasion that the battle to take Baghdad was going to be as bloody as Stalingrad. 

And I'm not talking about the press, open source think tank analysts, etc, I'm talking about GENERAL OFFICERS COMMANDING DIVISIONS, CORPS, ARMIES, AND CENTCOM. And like in Desert Storm, they got that shit horribly wrong. They couldn't predict how easy it would be. And yet we're to expect that some military analyst could have predicted that a single armored brigade from the US Army doing a ""movement to contact"" or ""reconnaissance in force"" would have trigger the fall of Baghdad in a single day? Especially when intel was even leaking to the press that there was a defense in depth battle plan to defend Baghdad made open source since [December 2002](https://cdn.prod.www.spiegel.de/images/bcf5f5d6-0001-0005-0000-000000586984_w420_r1.0294117647058822_fpx55.24_fpy44.86.jpg)? 

They all fucked that up, and yet nobody says ""well I got no respect for US Army general officers, they're all idiots, because their predictions didn't pan out."" Let alone analysts, pundits, retired brass, politicians, random social media posters, and of course Redditors? 

When the fuck has anyone every really predicted anything right? If there is anything humanity sucks at its predicting the future, at best its an educated guess. But when the guess is wrong, it doesn't undermine the people making them. Especially since basically all of them are outright incentivized to guess in the most outlandish and detailed way possible.",689d5d3e1ecff0a833604a45907445c02ad26784,True,False,,,,,0,1649373403,,0,{},i3ttfe7,False,t3_txdxls,False,True,t1_i3tlxll,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/txdxls/why_is_russia_losing_this_war/i3ttfe7/,1649373416,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649344603.0,

For example, non-belligerent states most stop providing arms and war supplies (like oil) to belligerent states or risk being named co-belligerents and having their ships and aircraft become targets of belligerent states. Non-belligerents also must be careful how they treat belligerent state personnel. If they favor one side in any way, they risk being labeled co-belligerents and thus targets.

&gt;In today's Russia Army, the practice of having relatively small staffs and the development of the institution of NCO's and warrior officers to conduct technical tasks (**in conjunction with the 2008 ""New Look"" reforms which condensed regiments and divisions into brigades and remove most ""cadre units"" from the books**) has likely created a Russian Armed Forces with a ratio of officers to enlisted soldiers on par with most Western armies.   
  
Another consequence of the Soviet Union's mass mobilization doctrine was the necessity to maintain units and equipment for these mobilized reservists. These units were/are manned by small full-time cadres that would keep the equipment serviceable and maintain enough institutional knowledge to bring the mobilized reserve up to some level of combat readiness before deployments. **Many of these ""cadre units"" were disbanded after the 2009 ""New Look"" reforms, as there was a a belief that resources were being wasted on maintaining a mass mobilization capability to the detriment of bringing active units up to full levels of operational readiness.**   
  
**When the Russian Federation converted to the brigade structure, it also designated all units as ""permanent readiness units,"" eliminating all ""cadre units""** and the positions of cadre (mostly officers) that manned them. In all, the Russians Armed Forces reputedly downsized from 1,890 to 172 large units.   
  
Force Restoration: In the past, the Soviet and Russian practice has been to replaced depleted units, not individuals. Depleted units were reorganized as smaller units, combined with depleted units or reconstituted with healed hospital patients and repaired equipment. There has been no move to adopt the Western system of individual replacement. **However, the strategic reservice system is no longer built around the ""cadre unit"" mobilization concept**, which involved a small cadre maintaining equipment...

There was tremendous debate about allowing West Germany to rearm and join NATO so soon after World War 2. The French, especially, were deeply concerned about it. And yet, it worked out and now the German-French relationship is considered one of the most powerful on the continent. Could the same have happened for Russia and NATO? I’m honestly not sure. Would Putin still come to power? If he did, would he act substantially different? How would the Russian populace act? There would be so many things that could potentially go wrong there, and I don’t know enough to even begin to predict how that would go. I suspect that the members of NATO at the time felt similarly. 


What I will say is that *not* expanding NATO would not have settled Russia’s security concerns. Their adversarial relationship with the rest of Eastern Europe goes back centuries, only broken by periods of imperial domination. What would have happened had we not allowed the former Warsaw Pact and the Baltic states into NATO? Does it seem likely that these nations, newly free from Russian colonial administrations, would have been the compliant “buffer states” that Russian foreign policy demands? I don’t think so. I find it more likely that these states would have sought to secure their independence through military buildup and the provision of their own nuclear deterrent, perhaps as a separate alliance. Such a thing would be worse for Russian security than NATO has ever been or will ever be. 


The truth is that Russia’s foreign policy in Eastern Europe has never not been colonial or imperialistic. The “buffer zone” that they desire will always involve implicit limits on the sovereignty of their neighbors. Such a situation would always be one of threatened violence.

Key Takeaways

Russian forces claim to have successfully captured central Mariupol, but Ukrainian forces retain control of the port southwest of the city. Russian forces will likely complete the capture of Mariupol in the coming days.

Russian forces are setting conditions for a major offensive in eastern Ukraine in the coming days, but damaged units redeployed from northeastern Ukraine are unlikely to enable a successful Russian breakthrough.

Ukrainian forces repelled continuing Russian attacks from Izyum southeast toward Slovyansk and Barvinkove.
Russian and Belarusian forces are conducting “demonstrative actions” to fix Ukrainian forces around Kyiv in place. However, these units are highly unlikely to launch new offensive operations, and Ukrainian units around Kyiv can likely safely redeploy to eastern Ukraine.

Western sanctions are likely successfully disrupting Russia’s military-industrial base.",32f5f043e32c890121706abe390c91cb7fc98f36,True,False,,,,,0,1649370222,,0,{},i3tlun7,False,t3_tybcfi,False,False,t3_tybcfi,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tybcfi/ukraine_conflict_daily_megathread/i3tlun7/,1649370234,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649341422.0,

The fuck it isn't. 

The prefix ""geno"" means race, kind, family or birth. 

Etymology: From the stem of Ancient Greek γένος (génos, “race, kind”), also Ancient Greek γεννάω (gennáō, “to produce”) and Latin gēns (“tribe, clan”) .

The suffix ""cide"" literally means killing of. 

Etymology: word-forming element meaning ""killer,"" from French -cide, from Latin -cida ""cutter, killer, slayer,"" from -cidere, combining form of caedere ""to strike down, chop, beat, hew, fell, slay,"" from Proto-Italic \*kaid-o-, from PIE root \*kae-id- ""to strike."" For Latin vowel change, see acquisition.

Together that means Putin and you are both full of shit. Stating that because Russia was no longer considered the official language in Ukraine makes it genocide in eastern Ukraine is stupid fucking hyperbole and makes those saying it look like idiots. Same goes when your countrymen misuse the term Nazi.

The rhetorical arguments for and against NATO expansion have not changed much since the 90’s. Clinton sounds here exactly as he did in [Detroit in 1991](https://www.nato.int/docu/speech/1996/s961022a.htm). It’s the same stuff in NATO’s 1995 study on enlargement.
[Found here](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_24733.htm)
That’s all to say that Western messaging for NATO expansion has been consistent for 30 years and is firmly rooted in the optimistic internationalism that was so prevalent in the 90’s. The idea was that the security provided by NATO membership would aid democratic consolidation in former Soviet and Warsaw Pact countries by integrating them into the wider European community and preventing territorial disputes from becoming conflicts. 


There’s a line of political science research concerning the concept of “territorial threat” and its relation to conflict. To be brief, disputes over land/borders between countries are the hardest issues to resolve and the most likely to bloom into armed conflict. Governments and people are deeply attached to land, and respond quite dramatically to threats to it. In my research, I found that citizens of countries under territorial threat were more supportive of military rule, nationalistic rhetoric, suppression of internal dissent, and xenophobic/authoritarian policies in general. In contrast, I found that citizens of nations relieved of territorial threat became more supportive of democratic processes and values over time. 


This research, I believe, gives credence to the idea that NATO membership was useful in shoring up democratic rule among its new members. By preventing territorial threats and guaranteeing borders both externally and between members, militaristic/anti-democratic attitudes found little support among the general public in a time where governments were lacking stability and at risk of backsliding. 


I think NATO expansion has ultimately been vindicated not only by the behavior of its new members, but also by Russia’s consistent disregard for the territorial integrity of its neighbors. Instead of these behaviors not happening if NATO did not expand, I find it more likely that they would be more extensive. The Baltic states, in particular, have many of the factors that have predicted Russian aggression in the past (strategic location, pro-Russian minority, pro-western government).


Moving forward, I am concerned over the democratic trajectory of Ukraine in absence of effective security guarantees like NATO membership or an equivalent. I’m hoping that this invasion, whatever it’s outcome, does not result in authoritarian backsliding in Ukraine justified by national security issues. We’ve already seen broad restrictions on certain political parties and other limitations on free speech and democratic practice justified by the war (which are probably warranted from a national survival standpoint). My fear is that these measures will become permanent and further ones will be implemented. If the West had offered credible security guarantees to Ukraine in the past, even precluding NATO membership, I think that this war would have been avoided and Ukraine’s democracy would be a healthier place. I hope that we correct this mistake in the future.",acc18fa9d2cfaa50ad6fcf4e3fb0b5596f473c46,True,False,,,,,0,1649361638,,0,{},i3t0krt,False,t3_tyfct0,False,True,t3_tyfct0,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tyfct0/bill_clinton_why_i_expanded_nato/i3t0krt/,1649361654,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649332838.0,

Again, he doesn't the political clout to even call this war a war, let alone declare it as such. How can he be at that level and then escalate to the level of doing the unthinkable? 

Remember, despite so many different countries having nukes for the last half century nobody has used them since Nagasaki. They not only didn't use them against nuclear powers that couldn't threaten them, they haven't used them against non-nuclear powers even after losing wars against them. It hasn't happened because there is a major cost to doing. Simply put, it opens up political pandora's box in a very bad way, if the user does it and gets away with it then it sets the most dangerous precedent in the history of humanity, that those weapons are available to be used in warfare at will. That means everyone has to turn on Russia, and yes, that potentially means a preemptive nuclear strike on them too. 

That is the risk, that is why nobody uses them, because nukes are the most massive escalation there is, and once they are used again the barn door is officially open.

&gt;Easy, we're having a conversation, no need to make it personal.

Everyone has fears except idiots or true psychos. Controlling them isn't easy, if it was there would be no legit reason to praise bravery. 

But to get involved in geopolitics, especially involving warfare, means knowing how to control fears. And that is most important when competing against someone like Putin, who makes a living through bullying others. 

Think of this as high stakes gambling. Imagine playing poker for more than pennies and focusing only on your fears of losing your hard earned money and thus always fearing your opponents have a better hand than you. To the point you allow your negativity to control your betting. You'd end up folding every hand, even the good ones because your opponents would read you and know that as soon as they up the ante you will fold because ""what if they have a royal flush?"" To play you have to be willing to risk. And to play well its not just risking, you have to understand odds, and you absolutely need to learn how to read your opponents. 

Geopolitics and especially high level military strategical command is all about being good at gambling. Many top level politicians and generals are well known gamblers, quite competent too.

As a result of the PLA’s dramatic modernization campaign, the Army’s credible deterrence impact has been significantly reduced. As the Indo-Pacific rapidly becomes the focus of U.S. strategic competition, many arguments will be forwarded as to the best way to strengthen USINDOPACOM’s posture in the face of the modern PLA. The proposed doctrine of decentralized deterrence presents an empirically proven, diplomatically viable, and rapidly implementable solution.

&gt; ...the PLA has embarked on a robust modernization campaign, particularly in antiaccess capability.6

&gt; This enhanced capability was dramatically demonstrated in a 2017 study by the RAND Corporation, which projected that the PLA had not only gained the ability to easily neutralize all U.S. positions within the ROK and Japan with ballistic and cruise missiles but could also disrupt operations at bases as far out as Andersen Air Force Base in Guam.

Per Ukraine, Russia has lost [698 MBTs](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1511989222340759553) (today, 9 am EET), a figure which likely includes DPR/LPR losses. This suggests Russia still has in the ballpark of \~2,800 MBTs, not all of which are currently engaged in Ukraine.

They have a further 10,200 older models in storage, some of which can be refitted for active service.

They can also procure new tanks from Uralvagonzavod.

&gt;But what does he lose?

His power, prestige, position, wealth, property, houses, cars, family, supporters, and his life. 

Putin isn't some Salafist caliph or communist party member turned general secretary who can't speak a single sentence without without professing their adherence to an ideology that promotes sacrifice, willingness to die, ends justifying means. Putin is a corrupt politician who managed to rally oligarchs to work with his govt as part of a kleptocracy founded on everyone making bank. Putin is one of the richest men in the world for a reason, simply by being in charge of the Russian govt and making that system work. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Putin could escalate by using a nuke on Ukraine

Putin can't even call the war in Ukraine a war. Think about that for a second and what it means in terms of political ramifications. 

Since declaring the ""special military operation"" Putin has then had to deal with the ramifications of downplaying his own major fuck up in the leadup and execution of this shitshow, namely his own involvement in the disastrous intelligence assessment and strategic planning which are 100% his fault either by trusting an incompetent he put into power that fed him bullshit or more likely micromanaging and projecting desire over reality.  One means he's a shitty leader, the other means he's an idiot. That is his life now, dealing with the fallout from that shitstorm, every day having to get briefings about the latest disaster in Ukraine and how there is no real solution. But suddenly the solution is to start nuclear Armageddon? 

If you take all that into consideration and are still worried heavily about Putin escalating to nukes, that is just fear that you can't control.",5fe9d92df48df335ba7b2728cd443eafe0d2cb88,True,False,,,,,0,1649358229,,0,{},i3srl93,False,t3_tybcfi,False,True,t1_i3snqe4,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tybcfi/ukraine_conflict_daily_megathread/i3srl93/,1649358239,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649329429.0,

To mobilize there has to be a reason, and Putin has not been honest about the war's progress so far, so to provide justification he must be honest first, in a big way to use the horrific conditions as proof that drastic measures have to be taken to rectify that. If he does, there is a good chance he destroys his political career and ends up suffering a health issue that requires him to retire from public life. 

\- Committing the reserves means the Russian Armed Forces pulls in about 2 million veterans from all branches of the military. That sounds impressive until you examine what it means. Let's say that 2/3 are ex-Russian Ground Forces (others are VVS and Navy), of them most of them are ex-one year conscripts of extremely limited value and aren't even combat troops. Of the whole lot, of the 2 million, only \`10% have done any refresher training or drills, the rest of them are similar to the US Inactive Ready Reserve

\- Conscription isn't popular within Russian culture due to corruption and shitty lifestyle for soldiers during the Cold War and horrific conditions during the Afghan and Chechen Wars. In order to make it more appealing, Putin enacted two major reforms about a decade plus ago, cutting it from 24 to 12 months and by making it against the law to use them in foreign wars without a declaration of war or some sort of public declaration of a national emergency, neither of which has happened. To make a mobilization work, Putin would have to change a bunch of laws (requiring political capital and public support) and then he would somehow need many hundreds of thousands of willing volunteers ready to sign up again for two years (because one year conscripts are next to useless in a war).  

\- Mobilizing does nothing in the short term. There is no cadre waiting around to accept newly activated reservists or any additional conscripts levied. There is no infrastructure, training areas, support personnel just waiting around for them to show up. To build units from newly arriving reservists/conscription means raiding existing units, to include the already heavily depleted combat units broken in Ukraine, to get officers, NCOs, and experienced junior enlisted to use as a framework for all the newly created units. All the stockpiles of older equipment likely haven't been maintained all that well, so they will then need to spent the time, money, and manpower with mechanics to get them all to operational specs and then moved to training areas and then later to combat zones. To do this would require probably 2-5 years before they'd even be ready to deploy to combat, and in the meantime the existing Russian Ground Forces, VDV, and SOF units are destroyed as cohesive and function units (assuming they haven't already due to extremely heavy losses sustained in Ukraine).",29390423fbf1eb74416f8a41eda7bb58d04373d8,True,False,,,,,0,1649356402,,0,{},i3smomw,False,t3_tybcfi,False,True,t1_i3sc7o0,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tybcfi/ukraine_conflict_daily_megathread/i3smomw/,1649356413,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649327602.0,

Trump Sec of Def Bolton has stated that he believed Putin was going to attack Ukraine in Trumps second term and Trump was going to pull out of NATO. If we assume this statement is John’s real position - it must be based on something.

The book “Putins People” details how in the last days of the Obama administration they were very much aware of Russian influence in the election. The book indicates Vice President Biden was one of the more anti-Putin members of the administration.

I’m assuming there is an enormous about of information that I, and most of us, don’t have access to.

My hunch is that events will play out loosely along the lines of the [German Spring Offensive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_spring_offensive) of 1918. They need to win here, so expect the best troops and equipment to be pushed to the front. Consequently, we should expect to see some major Russian successes, perhaps even the return of a (limited) war of movement of the kind we saw in late February. This will cause  a lot of panic about the encirclement of the forces in the Donbas, and lots of people will freak out.

However, the advance will lose momentum quickly (maybe the first week of May), blunted by fierce resistance of the increasingly well-supplied Ukrainians and the very high losses sustained by the best Russian units. In turn, we'll see counterattacks from the UKA, pushing the Russians back to the current LOC by June, and perhaps beyond. I have no idea how things will proceed from there; diplomatically the situation is quite different from Germany in 1918, with the impact of sanctions on the home front still very limited compared to the damage of the Allied Blockade.

Russian force projection difficulties in Ukraine are primarily a function of their inability to capture key railway nodes, i.e. Konotop, Sumy, Kharkiv, etc. In turn, their inability to capture those key junctions is primarily of function of insufficient force ratios, with especially low infantry numbers.

It's also not a completely unfair comparison to make. Certainly, throughout the first portion of the Cold War, Western Europe is not just militarily reliant on the US, but economically reliant. It's really only from the 1980s onward that European countries are becoming strong and integrated economies in their own right.

I also think that it's a big prestige hit for Russians to join a defensive alliance that they aren't leading. Russia is unique among European states (bar the UK) in that it no longer fears external aggression from its neighbours. It's impossible to invade it owing to strategic depth, size of conventional military and strategic arsenal.

&gt; If Russia ordered a general mobilization, as Ukraine did on Day 1, there's no reason to think they wouldn't be capable of fighting a major war.

Defending is lot easier than invading. Yes Russia is capable of defending against just about every nation bar USA, their rail system would come into play and alleviate many of the problems they have right now, but their force projection outside of their borders has been terrible for decades. And by terrible I am comparing it to to that one other nation that likes to frequently wage wars. Many of the Ratnik modernization efforts were spurred by the Georgia war which had similar issues but Georgia  was a tiny country with very small military so most people overlooked it. Of course, as this war is showing, Ratnik was mostly for show, only a fraction of their army is up to modern standards. And Syria was quite similar. They were dominant in the air due to lack of good AA by opposing forces but their land forces weren't doing all that well. 

And mobilization is not some magic button that makes your army 5x stronger, Soviets actually were trying to do something like that and had an extensive mobilization system that was capable of fielding an army of millions within months (which is what the glut of tanks was for), but Russia abandoned that. Their conscripts serve only a year now and do mostly secondary stuff, not learning how to operate tanks and artillery.

[],False,,nuclearselly,,,[],,,,text,t2_v479g,False,False,"Thanks for sharing - this is a really good read and insight into the decisions being made at the time.

When it comes to the West's dealings with Russia, I do have sympathy for the view that the reformist Moscow of the 1990s was a blip, and that it was in the best interests of Eastern Europe, in particular, to curtail the potential power of Russia in the future via NATO. If you take the long view, Russia for hundreds of years has sought to dominate its neighbours. 

Perhaps there would be a way to bring Russia into an economic mutual dependence with its neighbours as France or Germany did via the EEC/EU? But I would caution that Russia does not have a near-peer neighbour. It's either a huge country within a greater Europe (with a very different economic structure to the other states) or it's *the* dominant power in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It doesn't really have a 'France' to be balanced against and keep it in line.

Another aspect that Clinton mentions here which is interesting is the role of the Balkan conflict in this period of NATO enlarging. The Balkans are important for 2 reasons: they give NATO a reason for existence after the Cold War (peacekeeping and intervention in the near-aborad) and they demonstrate to the other states in Europe the inherent risks with the breakup of an 'empire' into smaller dominions. There were very valid fears in the Baltics and even Poland and other former Warsaw pact countries that Russia could become to them as Serbia was to its neighbours. NATO offers an appealing insurance policy against this.

Russia was also playing directly into these fears by this point. The country was facing its own 'mini-balkanization in areas like Chechnya, and responding with 'typical' Soviet/Russian brutality. Again, no surprise that former members of the USSR/Warsaw Pact were eyeing NATO as a safety net against this.

What strikes me as well here (and I do wonder precisely how accurate it is) is that Clinton repeats how the door was open for Russian NATO membership. There were clearly lots of attempts to give Russia a voice in European affairs (albeit, without much of a 'say' - eg Kosovo) and I do wonder if the right combination of post-cold-war economic aid to Russia, and pro-western Russian leadership could have brought the country into the fold. After all, Turkey has had a shaky history, comparative to Russia's in some ways but has been a long-standing member of the alliance.

I'm guessing you mean Putin got away with it in terms of Russian public opinion. If so, I'd be cautious about drawing conclusions about that. Putin has had two decades to consolidate power, he and his cabal control the state media and all instruments of violence, he jails/murders anyone who speaks out.

&gt; The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.

&gt; Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the Security Council. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security. 

Article 42.7:  
&gt; If a Member State is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other Member States
shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power, in
accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. This shall not prejudice the specific
character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States.
Commitments and cooperation in this area shall be consistent with commitments under the
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which, for those States which are members of it, remains
the foundation of their collective defence and the forum for its implementation.

My initial takeaways were that Article 5 explicitly mentions armed force while 42.7 does not, on the other hand 42.7 does say ""obligation of aid and assistance by **all** the means in their power"" (emphasis mine) which seems to imply military force is an obligation. 42.7 does contain the clause on ""prejudice"" which I'm guessing is where the ""weakness"" in the clause comes from.

Having its main naval base inside Nato territory ain't exactly what every non Nato member dreams of tbh.

The whole 'no threat' concept only works if you pretend that Nato is a solely defensive alliance that doesn't engage in offensive military action to enforce broad strategic/foreign policy goals. I'd much rather be in Nato than outside, but its not the benign/benevolent entity that we pretend it is. If I were outside Nato and not a bastion of democracy I would feel very threatened tbh. Your only option in that case is to either abandon the idea of even having geostrategic goals, or take the risk of doing what Russia is doing.

But yes I agree they were fucked before this war even started. Strategically there was no good option or outcome tbh.

&gt; The end of WW2 saw the western powers do the usual massive demobilization while Russia kept it’s army and turned Eastern Europe into vassal states. The Russians could have also demobilized amd focused on rebuilding their economy but they chose Russia Stronk and empire instead

It's a mistake to attribute the actions of the ussr to russia tbh. Ironically you could argue that this sort of thinking has led us to where we are today. 

Ukraine were that exact same ussr too.

&gt; So we had the Cold War which Russia lost. The West does a big draw down again. Russia doubles down on empire instead and their economy craters even more

Eh? This is happening because Russia did the exact opposite. Ukraine was created as part of a coup/power grab by some ussr officials whilst the ussr was falling into chaos. There wasn't any real Ukrainian national identity at the point, because it had only ever been a 'nation' for a couple of years back in 1918. Russia essentially let a large part of historic Russian land secede and create a new national identity distinct from Russia. It was very different to say the independence movement of the baltic states, because they actually had a state to secede with. 

Crimea had been part of Russia for 200 years and in their hubris the executive committee handed it to a 'region of russia' as they saw it as an off hand administrative decision, thinking that the glorious ussr would be eternal as a replacement for Russia. That's why putin is so angry about it lol.

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"A couple points on this.

- Even as far back as the 80s to early 90s the Soviet Union wanted to end conscription and go to a fully professional volunteer military force. Funding didn't allow for it, plus there was an old guard who thought conscription was patriotic and contract troops were mercenaries, despite all the officers essentially being contract troops. After poor performance in the 1990s through 2000s during the Chechen Wars and then the embarrassing Georgian invasion in 2008, the reformers finally had the clout to get the pocket books open to attempt to professionalize the Russian military. They still use conscripts but mostly for support jobs that don't require much skill, since the conscription total term of service is only 12 months (shortened from 24 months after the 2009 New Look reforms to make conscription more appealing to avoid the decades long trend of mass conscription avoidance).

- In terms of conscription, due to need to keep it popular, outside a declared national emergency, they're not legally allowed to serve in foreign wars, only inside Russia. That can be fixed by a new law, but it doesn't address the reason they did it in the first place, which was to make conscription easier to stop mass avoidance.


- Before this, and especially in the Soviet era, they had a massive amount of active duty combat divisions but most were essentially empty of all personnel besides field grade officers and minimal support, to act as cadre to quickly fill these hundreds of divisions with ex serving veteran reservists. But between the downsizing following the fall of the USSR and after the 2009 New Look reforms, those units are gone and the cadre of extra officers were nearly all cashiered. So that capability is gone. If they were to suddenly expand their military they'd have to raid existing units for experienced manpower, officers, NCOs, and experienced lower enlisted, to then augment with barely trained reservists or conscripts (most reservists are former one year conscripts)

- There is no longer any system set up in each military district to suddenly induct millions. They don't have the support infrastructure, manpower, or funding. If they do move to create it, again they're robbing Peter to pay Paul, it means their combat units have to be raided and their budget needs to be poached.

- To overcome all of this not only requires fully mobilizing Russian society in a way not seen since WW2 all for Ukraine and possible further invasions, not only requires a massive budgetary investment during the worst economic crisis Russia has suffered since the collapse of the Soviet Union, but it'll take years. Minimum of 2-3, more likely 4-5 before the first of the new units are even ready for combat in large numbers. At best they could use the extra personnel to simply reinforce their existing RuGF combat units, serve as replacements for manpower losses suffered through attrition (dead, wounded, psych casualties that are already in the many tens of thousands) but that is a far cry from suddenly expanding the force in a time of war.

WW1 and WW2 spoiled a lot of people in terms of creating an unrealistic standard for what is possible in war. What they did was amazing but what most people don't know was the framework to make all those amazing things happen all occurred well before the wars started, with lots of foresight, planning, orders written out and signed just waiting to be activated. Those don't exist anymore for Russia (or most other countries) because they invested in a better active duty military that was supposed to win wars without needing to rely on conscription or their reserves. So if they create them, it's happening from scratch in the middle of a meat grinder war that has already chewed up an alarming amount of their existing active duty army.",7f9327afc993c6c3fda11efac2c6e9c987a10d34,True,False,,,,,0,1649349619,,0,{},i3s545i,False,t3_tybcfi,False,True,t1_i3rwm8d,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tybcfi/ukraine_conflict_daily_megathread/i3s545i/,1649349630,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649320819.0,

The VDV are not the top tier, but they are much closer to that than cannon fodder. In addition, the concept of securing an air base near Kyiv to move in more troops and materiel quickly, especially if Russia expected minimal resistance, makes complete sense. 

But what we observed in the first week or so does not point to that. Repeated unsupported drops that did not achieve strategic objectives (although not all of them were instantly destroyed, of course, and did in some cases hold for a while, broadly the effect was minimal) and did not seem to lead to widespread disarray within Ukraine, or create a vulnerability Russia had the capacity to exploit.

IMO Russia had already lost when they thought they needed to invade Ukraine in the first place.

&gt;Russia repeated its threat of retaliation on Saturday (12 March) if Sweden and Finland ever decide to join NATO, warning of “serious military and political consequences”.

If relations did sour between Canada and the US, it's pretty obvious that a majority of the American public and political system would be against invasion.

Canada doesn't hate you because both sides made peace. It would have been easier to get the population to hate eachother given the history. It was the common sense of the leaders. Sensible leaders are sorely lacking today. 

&gt;Canada's also a fucking delicious example because they have no mechanism to prosecute or gain from an invasion of the United States - kind of similar to how Ukraine and Russia are.

Wasn't the case back when they agreed to make peace because, it would lead to prosperity and they wouldn't have to spend money on war.  Like I said, sensible leaders on both sides.

&gt;Again, trying to compare Russia's decision to us isn't as winning a comparison as Mearshimer made it seem.  You gotta think critically about what you read.

US would have invaded Cuba just as Russia invaded Ukraine. You can argue the morals, rights etc. It doesn't change the fact that Ukraine is getting wrecked and Ukrainians are dying.

&gt;Chinese media, Chinese people  
&gt;  
&gt;Indian media (to a lesser extent)

I think we are seeing peak propaganda that hasn't been seen since the Cold war. 

Can't blame the Chinese people, their internet ensures that no counter viewpoint gets in. 

I heard complaints that Indian media is is parroting Western Propaganda. I guess India is divided between it's Pro West and the Pro Communist camp( it has a huge communist party and a massive Maoist insurgency), so much so that Leader of Communist Party of India considers Xi Jinping his boss and has said so publicly. .

&gt;Are all parroting this  
&gt;  
&gt;Media in Russia is starting to say the the fundamental concept of a sovereign, independent Ukraine is rooted in Nazism.

That's not wrong historically. The Western Ukrainians who were fighting for freedom were Nationalists who hates Russians and Jews. They collaborated with SS and killed Jews.  Ukranians even helped in the concentration camps to gas Jews. The Baba Yar memorial is to the Jews killed by them. They never west away. Look up Oliver Stone's documentary on Ukraine. When Zelensky berated Israeli Knesset, the Israelis pointed this out. 

I am not sure if it's as relevant today, but if Western Ukraine is Rural then it's possible. Even in US the rural areas have more KKK presence than urban areas. 

&gt;My point is that nothing Russia is pushing makes it look like peace is an option, any time soon. Imagine try to sell to your people a peace deal with a country that was:

I believe Kremlin said that if Ukraine agrees to neutrality then this would stop in a moment. The longer this goes on harder it will become. More destruction means that the stances will harden.

Ukranians were Genociding people in Donbass by thrusting Ukranian culture on them. Genociding isn't just killing. They had bioweapon labs, any research institution that does scientific research on pathogens can be  a potential bioweapon lab. I think this fact has been twisted. Ukraine has a decent scientific base and can also be a potential nuclear power. I wouldn't be surprised if they haven't worked on some warheads, I don't know how much enriched uranium they hold.  

&gt;That's the issue with labelling people you don't like Nazis and just speculating about the evil things they do. It makes peace much harder, as your own population begin to hate the other

No one in this sub is going to be privy to the behind the scenes, but best I can tell, Poland is angling to obtain an incredibly favorable replacement agreement with the U.S. that the U.S. is not willing to provide, and that is the actual cause for the holdup.

I followed the public saga of the Polish MiGs pretty closely, from the very beginning when the Ukrainian air force even claimed on its facebook page that it would be flying combat missions out of Polish territory, and given all of the back and forth we saw, I'm gonna go with the simplest explanation rather than one that involves a super secret, super competent arrangement that us peons don't get to understand. 

Namely, that after a lot of chaotic communications in the early days of conflict, and a lot of existing guardrails against direct NATO intervention being eroded, transferring them was eventually recognized as too provocative to be worth it.

You're right tho that it was pretty funny to see Poland transparently attempt to manipulate the US into replacing a huge part of its air force *gratis*.

&gt; You have the dynamic totally backwards.

I don't think backwards. I recognize that it works both ways. Both parties have an interest in avoiding direct conflict with one another, but both need to avoid taking actions that will force events down a path that neither feels empowered to break out of.

If you send something ""too provocative"" then the Russian MoD and the FM have to say *something* about it, have to make *some* kind of threat. And how are they going to demonstrate that the threat is credible if not by acting on it in some way? It's the same reason that NATO fears Russian use of WMDs. Not necessarily for the immediate impact, but because of what NATO will feel ""forced"" to do in response. 

In this respect there's a large gap between MANPADs and, say, nuclear weapons, but where along the continuum does artillery lie? Fighter jets?

Anyway I don't disagree with anything you've written other than that there is clearly *some* real concern about escalatory potential guiding the policies behind arms transfers.

yes, of course, it spreads at the speed of light. one advantage of Chekist propaganda strategy is that it doesn't have to very consistent. they are not necessarily trying to tell the truth - they just publish many hypotheses to get people to not believe objective reality. 

and of course, the west's own 5th column doesn't help. RIA right now has an article up quoting ""Ukraine expert"" Scott Ritter on Ritter's own hypotheses on how Ukraine forged Bucha

A lot of current Russian propaganda strategy is inherited from late-soviet strategy, which is to publish as many versions of truth as possible and see what sticks:

&gt;I don't think that anyone thinks that Russia is just going to lob a nuclear weapon into Poland to discourage these arms transfers, but there is clearly some military concern that a dispute over arms transfers could potentially serve as a pathway to direct conflict. It's not purely domestic politics. If you can, it seems preferable to avoid the following chain of events:
&gt;
&gt;1. Increasingly bellicose Russian complaints and then threats about stopping arms transfers
&gt;2. Missile strikes close to the Polish border (we've seen a few of these) where they're easiest to intercept(?), maybe one of which hits inside Poland itself, intentionally or no
&gt;3. Political and military political pressure to respond ""in kind""
&gt;4. etc.

This simply isn't a likely scenario. Russia is not going to flirt with triggering Article 5 over missile strikes that have limited military upside in the first instance, and you are brushing aside the choice to create that risk far too lightly. 

You have the dynamic totally backwards. Triggering Article 5 is something that *Russia* must desperately avoid, much moreso than NATO. Put yourself in Russian shoes: what is the cost-benefit of taking that course of action? Would it increase, or decrease the odds of a favorable outcome for Russia?

This is one of the best things Realism does - setting realistic goals. One of the drawbacks of the Unipolar world the US has dominated since the end of the Cold War is that there are no peers to keep a check on its power. The US being unusually 'secure' in a strategic sense - great power combined with its superpower status means it can go around the world poking its 'big stick' wherever it feels like with little chance of blowback.

Realism correctly calls out this lack of strategic long-term thinking.

I think what Ukraine does show is how it can be unfair for the great powers to divide the world among them and not expect things to change. The cultural/economic attraction to Europe is clearly present in Ukraine and has been growing. Would it be fair for people in a democracy to have to simply accept that being in Russia's 'sphere' is their lot in life, or should they court allies to help them push off Russia's heavy hand?

Realism would suggest 'sorry - not our security, not our problem' but an issue with a collective defence alliance stretching from Vancouver to the Polish border means that some countries feel Ukraine *is* a direct security interest for them. It's a difficult balancing act. 

Another reason Realists advised against NATO expansion - getting drawn into these confrontations with Russia and its neighbours was a reason to not do it.

Like these examples continue to illustrate the difference - France pulled out of Africa.  All of Europe pulled out of Africa, and we aren't coming back.

It's not purely domestic politics. If you can, it seems preferable to avoid the following chain of events:

1. Increasingly bellicose Russian complaints and then threats about stopping arms transfers
2. Missile strikes close to the Polish border (we've seen a few of these) where they're easiest to intercept(?), maybe one of which hits inside Poland itself, intentionally or no

Most of the discourse surrounding Realism with regards to Ukraine over the past 5, 10, 20 years has mostly been 'not the West's problem - stay out of it'.

If you broadly agree with the sentiment of 'might makes right' and that the West/US cannot police the entire world, then Ukraine naturally falls into the security influence of Russia (just as Belarus and the Central Asian Republics do).

Liberalism/Internationalism (and the US neo-liberal Bush admin) has gone against most of these 'realist' arguments with reference to Ukraine and the former Soviet Union/Warsaw pact as a whole. The West has mostly embraced the former Soviet states, which has of course antagonised Russia. The Realist argument is that we only prolong suffering and cause greater issues for the people who live in the 'periphery' by attracting them to the West if we don't consider them a vital security interest. This is because if we *don't* consider them a vital security interest, we won't adequately protect them through collective defence/US intervention if they come up against a hostile power.

Now - that is the Realist standpoint/argument. I understand it from a practical standpoint but I always have been of the opinion that Realism when applied in international relations unfairly deprives 'weaker' democratic states outside of the traditional 'west' of agency. 

While Ukraine is the weaker country in this standoff, with the appropriate support they have been able to resist an invasion by superior power (so far). The people of Ukraine have also increasingly chosen *themselves* as a democracy to move closer to the West and away from Russia, and I don't agree with Realists hand-waving away the consequences of this as being irrelevant to the security situation.

Liberal internationalists believe that the more countries that adopt a western-centric democratic approach, the less tension and the more cooperation there can be among powers. Democracies don't tend to fight each other. Adding more democracies to the gang is therefore the goal. Balancing this against the security interests of non-democracies that are big and scary has been a persistent issue in international politics since the end of the Cold War.",c8f76e90ae74b6dad2deee1ddea531d95a65a208,True,False,,,,,0,1649341183,,0,{},i3rku5o,False,t3_txsc6i,False,False,t1_i3nzqyq,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/txsc6i/strategic_foresight_and_the_war_in_ukraine_a_good/i3rku5o/,1649341201,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649312383.0,

1. That the flow of materiel is limited by the fear of nuclear reprisal from Russia. That is not a realistic possibility and would be completely counterproductive for Russian aims. Similarly, there is zero chance of Russia attacking a NATO country (Poland) over Western resupply; again, it would be enormously counterproductive. Russia has no military levers to pull to stop that flow of materiel. The constraints on what the West can provide are principally (a) internal politics and (b) what will actually be useful to Ukraine.

2. That you can just dump huge swathes of tanks and jets into Ukraine, and they will be useful. Ukraine's military is not trained on these platforms. I imagine this is pretty self explanatory.

3. That the outcome of this war is just a function of pumping X amount of tanks or Y amount of jets into Ukraine. The reality is, quite obviously, far too complex to be susceptible to that kind of dumbed down reasoning.

Russia is rapidly losing its ability to do offensive operations, the big Donbas push is basically their Battle of the Bulge. If they keep failing for another month or two and taking the same kind of casualties, they simply won't be able to attack anything.

Ukraine's problem is that without air force and a lot of modern tanks it would have huge trouble actually retaking occupied territory. The strategy of ""bleed Russians until they go home"" worked on the Northern front, but we don't know if it will work again.

Ukraine would also very much like the war to end as soon as possible, as their civilians are dying and their infrastructure is getting wrecked every day. And the only realistic way to end the war is to defeat Russia. So they keep asking for heavy hardware so the war doesn't drag on forever.

Although I’m not sure about sourcing, there is a level of detail in his analysis that I haven’t really seen anywhere else. The latest is focused largely on the fight around Izyum, but touches on a lot of details of the eastern and south-eastern theatres.

Some interesting detail on the artillery battle around Izyum, as well as the first mention I’ve seen about UA using domestically produced laser-guided rounds.

In any case, I’m curious about what the more knowledgeable folks here think about this analysis. :)

&gt;	Since my last newsletter on April 1, the Russians have been able to take full control of the city of Izyum and to expand their foothold on the southern bank of the Northern Donets River. They have advanced approximately seven kilometers south in the direction of the city of Slovyansk and a similar distance southwest towards the town of Barvinkove. Nonetheless, the Russians have moved only four battalion tactical groups (BTGs) across the Northern Donets. The blown bridge in Izyum has forced them to cross the river by pontoon bridge, which slows the process. Moreover, two of the BTGs are substantially degraded by battle and unless reinforced by fresh troops, will be unable to advance.

That said, it’s hard to guess what amount of military aid actually would be considered “necessary” at a minimum, and how close the West is to meeting that minimum.

So my question is, in a perfect world where politics and fear of nuclear reprisals is not a concern, and where an unlimited amount of weaponry including tanks, planes, artillery, etc. could be given to Ukraine, what’s the minimum amount that might be needed to push Russia out of Ukraine? Just spitballing here, but as an example, is it something like 500 tanks? 1000? 100 fighter jets? 200?

Thank you for pointing out the info war/propaganda going on in Russia, the same is happening in the West. I will once again say that the longer this drags on, worse it will get. Soldiers do crazy thins when they are afraid. If you look at Urban war as it happened in Iraq etc you will see a pattern. In Iraq people would be shot if they got too close to a convoy. The same happened in Afghanistan. Soldiers are human, they do feel fear and don't always act rationally. This was explained by a senior officer when I was discussing rules of engagement. 

I hope to god we can have a ceasefire and find a diplomatic solution. They will have to do it eventually.

[],False,,OperationMobocracy,,,[],,,,text,t2_124wre,False,False,"&gt; The idea that the Russian army is ill prepared for conventional war, however, is no longer accurate since they spent the better part of the 2000s ""replacing nukes"" as the ""wall of fire"" with a mass of self-propelled artillery and rocket launchers.

There's an old expression, ""he knows the words, but not the music"".

Building a lot of tanks or self-propelled artillery is one thing, but what seems missing is the planning and execution or maybe even the mindset for fighting a conventional war with these tools. I'd mostly ascribe this to the many problems that seem to plague a lot of authoritarian militaries -- micromanagement by the dictator, excessively optimistic reporting from military and intelligence leaders because pleasing the authoritarian is a survival skill, and a rank and file that is somewhat disinterested and uninformed.

I actually do wonder whether the Russian military has ever actually done a level of planning for a peer/near-peer military conflict with nuclear weapons deliberately removed from the toolbox as part of the planning exercise.  It's like they seem to have disregarded conflicts of this scale or with capable peers, like at some point they've always just assumed they will turn to nuclear weapons when their adversity crosses some threshold.

Thus maybe they're only mentally/conceptually able to think of conventional military conflict in terms of pacification of defiant neighbors.  Any larger conflict with NATO or China always carries this assumption of nuclear escalation and they just stop thinking about what these would be like if they stayed conventional.

I think even the US fell into the trap of not thinking about large scale conventional conflict without nuclear weapons, but a mixture of Vietnam, the exposure to the Arab-Israeli wars and other factors caused it to think differently about how to use conventional weapons to win conventional conflicts where massive superiority didn't guarantee a victory.  I'd almost hazard a guess that perhaps even political jockeying for budgets aided the US to some degree, as you had mostly non-nuclear land and naval forces trying to keep up budgets and stay relevant without nuclear weapons as part of the equation.",1356cbf58c02aafefe9ae75dba1eb690dc8b2143,True,False,,,,,0,1649337151,,0,{},i3rbnn5,False,t3_txdxls,False,True,t1_i3my48j,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/txdxls/why_is_russia_losing_this_war/i3rbnn5/,1649337168,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649308351.0,

However, having said that I do not have the slightest of idea, I do think that we will not see an end before both sides have exhausted their offensive capability.

Politically Ukraine will not agree to further de facto land loss (i.e after 24th of February) unless their army is utterly destroyed. Pre 24th of February borders are the absolute minimum the Ukrainian people might agree to as long as they do not feel completely defeated.

Russia will not agree to a peace that does not give them de facto more territory unless it is clear to Putin that the Russian army just can't secure it. This requires a further degradation of Russian forces and the Ukrainian recapture of the Southern front.

Neither of these conditions seem to be true in the near future.

What I assume will happen, is that Russia will now proceed with the Eastern campaign (unclear with what scale) to destroy the more capable parts of Ukrainian army, to destroy the Ukrainian offensive capability and to seize lands to force Ukraine to a peace deal that provides a victory for Putin.

Ukraine will do their best to slow and halt the Russian advance while chipping away at their forces, both at the tip of the spear as well as the rear. After they have stopped the Russian army in the east, they will commence a counter-attack to regain the South. Ukrainian army command knows, that if they do not manage to do both of these tasks (stop Russia and liberate South) then Ukraine will be either locked in a long and painful stalemate or be forced to agree to a losing peace. Thus Ukrainian army is probably going to commit a lot of their offensive capabilities. There is a political imperative, in that the army cannot indefinitely conserve their forces, if it means the deterioration of the state itself.

This entire campaign will take at least a month, probably two or more (assuming neither side completely collapses, which I do not consider likely). Also this assumes no sudden political change (I consider very unlikely). By then it will depend on the outcome of the offensive/counter-offensive and if Ukraine prevails, the willingness of Putin and Russia to conduct a large scale national mobilization for the preparation of another offensive.

I consider the likelihood of a decisive Russian victory in the East very low. This would however be the fastest way to peace (Ukraine agreeing to peace). Maybe 1-2 months.

I consider the likelihood of a decisive Ukrainian victory in the East to be medium. This would be the second fastest way to peace (Russia agreeing to peace). Maybe 2-6 months.

I consider the likelihood of an indecisive stalemate to be of medium-high likelihood. Where neither side achieves decisive success and where both sides lose so much offensive capability, that without a further national mobilization could not be restored. This could evolve into a new static low-medium intensity conflict that could last for years or decades.

Nowadays Russia conscripts around 200-300k people per year, so clearly the need for all of these tanks decreased. But instead of ""melting up"" the tanks they had, majority of them were placed in long term storage. The thing is that fundamentally the doctrine hasn't changed all that much from WW2. But the physical reality has.

Why do the Western countries not have such large tank armies anymore? Because the West has moved away from the doctrines and ideas of WW2. Instead of huge mass-mobilized armies, most Western armies are small professional and volunteer based armies. Availability of manpower is substantially less and much more of it is designated into support roles than in the past. Meaning that even if UK had 10k tanks, they would still only be able to man a couple hundred of them.

The West in general just does not see a point in having that many tanks. In honesty, many have asked if there is ANY point in having ANY tanks. However heavy armour does provide a battlefield utility that no other weapon system can, at least so far. So major armies are still maintaining a fleet of a couple hundred tanks.

Kosovo war could have been comparable to the non Crimea part of the 2014 war. I mean aside the fact that the Ukrainians did not massacre thousands of Russian speakers in their country. It has no resemblance to the clearly imperialistic Russian offensive to take over Ukraine in 2022.

&gt;Say for a minute that we treat this as an escalation of an ongoing civil war in a couple of breakaway republics

We cannot because:

1. The front was quiet on the Ukrainian side. The situation was stable aside from Russian false flags and Russian provocations. There was absolutely no pretext for starting this war of aggression.
2. By Russian statements **and** actions this was war on Ukraine itself, pushing for Kyiv. 

Comparison fall flat.

&gt;Ironic don't you think?  


You've quoting historic revisionism, Russia was pushed out of Eastern Europe by the people living in Eastern Europe and it's own political instability. It did not leave out of it's good will. They held on to their occupation of eastern Europe, complete with mass violence as long as they could.

&gt;has disbanded the Warsaw pact

Russia did not ""disband Warsaw pact"" it was disbanded under them through the people in said countries no longer willing to stay under Russian boot and Russians having no ability to enforce said boot.

&gt;has limited its forces

You mean their economy has collapsed and they no longer had the ability to maintain a huge military.

&gt;NIS have abandoned nuclear weapons

What's NIS stand for? Russia never abandoned nukes.

&gt;NATO expanded to the East

Previously occupied Russian vassals sought to join NATO for shared protection, 2022, 2014 and 2008 shows that it was for good reason.

&gt;created new arms programs

""NATO"" did not create any new arms programs. Are you seriously claiming that modernizing weapons is somehow unique to any country? Yeah, tech gets better, old gear gets replaced. NATO forces have immensely downsized as a result of the fall of the USSR, Germany alone went from 3k tanks to a few hundreds of operational ones.

&gt;Well they directly intervened in an ongoing civil war with the aim of enforcing their desired geopolitical outcome. 

1. Iranian instigated the civil war by arming and supporting the Houtis since 2009, 5 years before the war even started.
2. Saudis were not involved in the civil war from the start, their intervention happened as Aden was about to fall almost a year later.
3. An Iranian supporter complaining about Saudi involvement in the civil war is pot calling the cattle black.

&gt;? I

They set up for a massed land war where they would pull a full conscription of about 2 million reservists. Their theories come from the 30s\`\\40s era Deep Operation, to attack en masse at multiple locations simultaneously. They build tanks that were light, low profile but cheap and easily manned by conscripts. 

The plan was to use formations like Shock Armies to overwhelm defences and exploit break throughs ruthlessly. Other than the autoloader the T-72 (as an example) was less sophisticated than its US or other counterpart. 

One of the major failings of this war is they tried to strategic set up for mass armour, but without the manpower. Leaving each axis enormously under resourced. Especially with rear echelon support and logistics. 

&gt; It just strikes me that a total of 227 tanks for the entire UK is awfully low given our defence spending.

Cold War era we relied on the implied threat of going tactical nuclear. But we also expected to be mostly on the defensive. Our tanks are heavier by a significant margin but also had much more optics and computing so were more survivable and likely to get first hits. 

We also spent far more on airpower and expected a big chunk of our armour kills to come from that, specifically the Lynx back in the day. 

Today we are far more about expeditionary wars against small states and non state actors. 

Tanks and crew are expensive and not as much use in those wars as other assets. 

So it boils to very different philosophies in what we expect to be doing in a war. This majorly affects tank design and willingness to spend on the heavy metal.",b5f92118ee1720b8c74d3aace44dd954a984971b,True,False,,,,,0,1649330243,,0,{},i3qyqxt,False,t3_txlmm4,False,False,t1_i3qpmk2,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/txlmm4/ukraine_megathread_april_6/i3qyqxt/,1649330254,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649301443.0,

Playing devil's advocate, but how is this that different (superficially) to the kosovo war?

Say for a minute that we treat this as an escalation of an ongoing civil war in a couple of breakaway republics (something that is broadly dismissed/ignored within western discourse). 

In both instances an external power supported a separatist movement in a sovereign country (remember the KLA were originally a terrorist group. Western intelligence trained and supported them from early on). In both cases an external power went in and bombed the shit out of a sovereign country without international authorisation (in both cases the UN had condemned the ongoing conflict) with the aim of forcing that state to cede territory under the guise of 'liberating an oppressed minority from their oppressors'.

The terms forced on Serbia were also objectively absurd in the peace agreement. They literally gave NATO full immunity under the law. I also enjoyed the irony/ hypocrisy of the US essentially blackmailing serbia into handing over milosevic despite it being contrary to their constitution, but that's a different topic altogether.

&gt; Saudi Arabia never invaded Yemen, their support of the Yemeni government is most similar to the Iranian own support of the Syrian government in the respective civil war. Are you as critical with the Iranian support in weaponry to their Yemeni proxies and the suffering it creates?

Well they directly intervened in an ongoing civil war with the aim of enforcing their desired geopolitical outcome. Is that hugely different in practice? That they've supported said civil war since the start isn't hugely relevant is it?

Worth noting too that the current conflict can in fact be seen as just another proxy war between the west and russia.",4794cc0a448287913095ba01f5510162a965f013,True,False,,,,,0,1649328508,,0,{},i3qw3t3,False,t3_txlmm4,False,True,t1_i3qg3cw,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/txlmm4/ukraine_megathread_april_6/i3qw3t3/,1649328523,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649299708.0,

Can anyone explain why Russia has *so. many. tanks*? Is it just a function of physical country size? Is it just heavily dependent on the various military strategies employed by different countries?

Alternatively, can someone explain why the UK seemingly has so few tanks?

I was under the impression that our airforce was heavily under-resourced in terms of for instance even managing to equip our aircraft carriers?

Alternatively, is this just a flawed statistical measurement? For instance the UK has a load of 'heavy machinery' that just doesn't quite fit the definition of a tank even though it has a big ol' turret on it?

I note that for instance apparently the US only has about 2500 in active service out of 6000ish, but i'm assuming that even for the iraq invasion we only took over a fraction of our actual numbers?

There are kits to turn unguided Grad rockets and 152mm shells into guided munitions. 

I believe the Ukrainians also uses 120mm mortars so the West could be also send guided mortar shells like the Strix. Also since the Ukrainians already know how operate large caliber artillery like 152mm and rocket artillery then the west should send them their own MLRS and 155mm artillery and the guided munitions to go with them as it wouldn't be too different from loading/using them from Soviet artillery unlike more training intensive systems like the Patriot missile defense system and F-16 fighters. 

I also support having the UK send some long range Brimestone anti-tank missiles. There was discussion on just putting a box launcher of them on the back of an old soviet APC.

Western sentiment is that Ukraine does not belong to Russia, they have a right to decide on their own destiny. NATO does not occupy countries and press them in, it's those countries that ask to join NATO, usually because they're feeling an external threat. Do you believe Iran had the right to supply with arms the Iraqis against an American invasion and occupation? Well you're seeing the same here, an invader and nations that support the people under invasion.

&gt;Most people in the West were perfectly fine with their governments providing all kinds of sophisticated and deadly weaponry in the hands of the likes of Saudi, or outright cooperating with them, while being generally indifferent to the sufferings of people outside the West' borders like the one we see in Yemen.

Saudi Arabia never invaded Yemen, their support of the Yemeni government is most similar to the Iranian own support of the Syrian government in the respective civil war. Are you as critical with the Iranian support in weaponry to their Yemeni proxies and the suffering it creates?

&gt;But now that tranquility has been broken by a war that Russia started, there seems to by a hysterical overreaction by the larger Western public that a significant amount of non-Western people I've spoken to consider to be fairly hypocritical.  


People are reacting more severely to issues in their backyard, and to people with cultural similarity.

A provincial election in Alberta, Canada had a huge troll problem, where 1/3 of the Twitter accounts talking about the election were bots ([https://globalnews.ca/news/5170015/alberta-election-twitter-bots/](https://globalnews.ca/news/5170015/alberta-election-twitter-bots/)).

You assume the West is doing the same, and I wouldn't disagree, but I would guess that the West is genuinely behind this game for several reasons. One, Western countries have a robust free press where shenanigans like this would eventually be found and publicized, making such attempts at social psyops extremely high risk.

In addition, surface vessels tend to have a lot of ASW assets at their disposal. Towed arrays, sonobouys, helicopters with dipping sonars and torpedoes, missiles that launch torpedoes, or both. Aircraft can spread out and cover a large area, imposing an area of denial. Meanwhile, you have one submarine or maybe a couple if wolfpacks are still relevant. 

Of course, aircraft and surface ships have their weaknesses as well. Despite great strides in technology, the thermal layer is still a factor. To keep things simple, the thermal layer is caused by a sudden gradient in the ocean’s temperature and density at a certain depth, affecting the velocity and direction of the sonar wave by creating more resistance and by bending the sonar wave. If the layer is strong enough, then theoretically, the sonar wave will reflect off the thermal layer, bounce back to the surface and maybe get bounced back to the thermal layer. 

Of course, the thermal layer isn’t something you should count on as it varies a lot. For example, it tends to be closer to the surface in winter and deeper in the summer. And sometimes, the water simply isn’t deep enough for there to even be a thermal layer.

However, a submarine can counter that by simply diving under it. Of course, there are other options, namely the installation of hydrophones in strategic areas like the GUIK gap or the American East Coast (cough, cough, SOSUS). However, in an ocean sized haystack, a submarine is a pin. ASW assets can’t cover every inch of the ocean. Submarines placed in certain areas where it would be dangerous or out of reach of other assets can help to alleviate that issue.

After all, submarines are harder to track than aircraft or surface ships. You can never be sure where a submarine might lie, until it either strikes, or you detect it first.",4f6a61fd030758c9e3775a673a4df3f61d36a0dc,True,False,,,,,0,1649299101,,0,{},i3ppiwq,False,t3_txvhjd,False,True,t1_i3otamk,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/txvhjd/seouls_misguided_desire_for_a_nuclear_submarine/i3ppiwq/,1649299113,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649270301.0,

[So I created a visualization of ""when is Russia going to lose its last tank""](https://taw.github.io/open-source-adventures/episode-33/). With my best guesses it's going to happen on 9 Oct 2022, and after that it's [Ural War](https://www.reddit.com/r/shittytechnicals/comments/fhyha8/ural_truck_with_some_gun/).

Some explanations:

* Adjustment for losses data - how much to adjust Ukrainian provided data. Oryx is at about -30%, but they say they have 200+ vehicle backlog, and there's no way that all destroyed vehicles are photographed, so reasonable range of values is -20% to +10%.
* Predicted future war intensity - are Russian losses going to be lower (because less front), higher (Ukraine getting heavier weaponry and Russians doing their last push)? Default is 100% so current trend continues, but you can adjust it.
* Russian tanks at start of war - supposedly around 2800, but you can adjust it slightly
* Russian tanks in storage - supposedly around 10000, but you can adjust it slightly
* Usable tanks in storage - OK, this is a big one, what % of tanks in storage can actually be used in combat, I'm guessing 10% based on available pictures, but if you feel really optimistic about it, move this slider to any percentage. The thing is even if they're not total trash, it would take very long time to reactivate them. 

Anyway, no matter where you move the sliders, Russia is really screwed.

I could do similar graphs for other equipment types, or start from Oryx data (and adjust up, as it's definitely lower bound) instead of Ukrainian data (and adjust up/down).
