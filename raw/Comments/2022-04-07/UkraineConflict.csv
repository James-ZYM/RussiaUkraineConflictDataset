Hell, look at the weight in their mag pouches.

The dudes they kitted out didn't even drop their mags- shits are fully loaded or else they'd be moving while they walk.  Definitely mags in there too since they're properly formed three-stacks to the mag pouches.  So either the RUS army has such loose controls of their POWs that they're letting walk around with ammunition in their mags, or it's staged with actors kitted out with UA gear.  It's not like they didn't capture enough kit while taking over Crimea to suit up a cadre with some UA gear for disinfo.

I get burning out on the shit though.  I do it for a bit and then go about my day.  I will say, it is nice that they're so poorly trained in decent disinfo practices outside of the RT staff- they're pretty easy to disprove.

And I am all to aware that the account talking to me a so called veteran of Fallujah in Iraq is either pro Russian or I would say more likely a moron who wants to believe those that suit his narrative.
The video that was filmed and released by Russian forces has to be questioned especially when the so called captured soldiers look the way they do. No clear identification of who they are when it was filmed and location it could be very well staged either by use of Russian soldiers with stolen uniforms or by placing a small amount of Ukrainian detainees captured at a different time or location.
You have to question when many look to have nothing but clean clothing still wearing body armour and all of a sudden there is a fully kitted out soldier who looks SF. So many factors that cause for questioning of the video that has not been officially confirmed in fact it has been denied by authorities from Ukraine.
You would think the Russians would do all they could to ensure the time, location and identity of them could not be questioned if it was to be true.

I don't see how this gets solved without force, coup, or unforseen occurrence. I don't even think Putin dying from cancer could stop this thing now.

In the beginning, most of the news was focused on Ukraine and the hot war. This is no longer the case, although there is still a shit load of news and tragedy coming out of Ukraine, but now I'm equally inundated by stories surrounding the effects and movement outside of Ukraine.

Conflict brings change folks, and this feels like a big one. The world is firmly under a world war watch, meaning that while not imminent, the conditions are favorable for the forming of world war producing conflicts.  

As the lines continue to be drawn all over the 🌎,  and as deals and backoom handshakes increase, threats and counter threats exchanged, that we are approaching a point of no return. 

At some point, somebody is going to cross the real red lines, and someone is going to be obligated to back up their threat. This could be a stray missle land in nato , air liner shot down (again), any accident could be disastrous.

What you are suggesting almost certainly would result in world war...and not the NATO vs Russia kind.

Anyway, I said that those kids are guilty of the murders, rapes and what have you that they did, nowhere did I excuse them. What I did say is that this is bound to happen as soon as discipline breaks down, remember Abu Ghraib and many other examples from all over the world.

Even though I do agree that many (if not all) will be clear about the objective after a few weeks, I don't think just deserting is that easy. If you get caught, you get shot. If the other side sees you and don't let you talk, they may shoot you  and in the mean time you have to eat, which in a situation like that is almost certainly looting and stealing. Many do surrender given the chance, they don't always do. That is not to say that they aren't guilty if they do something wrong, just not black and white.

The civilians, yes, they support a war and some even the genocide. I am not convinced that they know what they exactly support though. They may think they are right in doing so because the other side is pure evil. Sort of like proposing to wipe out an entire population of a country with a nuke, you know, genocide to better the world.

Yes, there is nuance, but there's no nuance regarding soldiers who torture, murder and rape. In fact, after a couple of weeks into the war, there's no nuance regarding soldiers in general. By that time they already knew why they where there for. They already knew they were there to genocide Ukrainians. They could have deserted/surrendered.

A more general comment on all the folks bashing opposition politics. Americans are overwhelmingly in favor of Ukraine even if they differ on details. Only 13% of Americans disapprove of sanctions on Russia. Considering 15% believe in QAnon, 4% are illiterate, and over half of Americans have less than a 6th grade level reading ability, I find this fantastic levels of support. Definitely way more than enough to motivate politicians.

&gt; The vote to remove Russia from the Human Rights Council comes several weeks after the country invaded Ukraine and just days after reports of a massacre of Ukrainian civilians in Bucha, Ukraine.

&gt; The resolution to vote Russia out of the premier human rights body was initiated by the United States following the Bucha killings.

&gt; The resolution focused on &amp;quot;Grave concern at the ongoing human rights and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, particularly at the reports of violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law by the Russian Federation, including gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights.""

,[],False,,igot_it,,,[],,,,text,t2_658amnb2,False,False,"Wow. There is no way to tel what type of bomb was used until you see the crater and fragments. That’s because the explosion can be from the payload or the target. Large supplies of fuel or ammo can create huge explosions, without in depth image analysis (like high speed film) you can’t really tell what is causing what. 
Thermobaric weapons produce large fireballs because they use atmospheric oxygen as the oxides for the fuel. High explosives carry their own oxidizers. The reason this is advantageous is that you can carry more fuel in a given payload because the space isn’t taken up by oxidizers. The trade off is that the velocity of the shockwave is reduced and the duration of it is increased. This is also the reason that they are considered inhumane. The blast wave is lower intensity so a person might survive it and be conscious while the fuel burns them to death. The weapons are more effective in enclosed  spaces due to the longer push the blast wave exerts. This characteristic tends to lift and push structure apart causing them to collapse as opposed to high velocity charges that tend to cut or shatter materials. Either way is a terrible way to die.",003f9db00775128060f792cb92885a8079ba77da,True,False,,,,,0,1649351694,,0,{},i3sadgt,False,t3_t4eeqj,False,True,t3_t4eeqj,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/t4eeqj/what_kind_of_weapon_is_this_sent_from_kharkov_a/i3sadgt/,1649351713,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1649322894.0,True,,,

President Donald Trump: first impeachment (2020)

In February 2020, President Donald Trump was impeached on two charges: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. This stemmed from a phone call he had with the recently elected President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, in July of 2019, in which Trump made a request for the president to investigate the energy company, Burisma, which Joe Biden’s son worked for. In exchange for this, the US leader would agree to a highly prized face-to-face meeting between the two presidents.",f49662df0cba4d3921c1e7a352e61ff731565015,True,False,,,,,0,1649348340,,0,{},i3s1s6f,False,t3_ty8zzn,False,True,t1_i3rzyim,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/ty8zzn/neighbours_war_somewhere_in_the_usa/i3s1s6f/,1649348354,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1649319540.0,,,,

**Russians’ statements about Trump**

- “Donald’s right, and I agree with him,” [regarding US troop withdrawal from Syria] said President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, whose influence over Syria can only grow more dominant as the United States exits.
- “Trump is God’s gift that keeps on giving,” said Vladimir Frolov, a Russian columnist and foreign affairs analyst. “Trump implements Russia’s negative agenda by default, undermining the U.S.–led world order, U.S. alliances, U.S. credibility as a partner and an ally. All of this on his own. Russia can just relax and watch and root for Trump, which Putin does at every TV appearance.”
- “We can tolerate some degree of unpredictability and mercurial policies on the tactical level — it’s worth it,” Mr. Frolov, the Russian foreign affairs analyst, wrote in response to written questions. “In Trump we trust … to do the right thing.”
- Konstantin Kosachev, head of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Upper House of the Russian Parliament, has said that “the departure of James Mattis is a positive signal for Russia, since Mattis was far more hawkish on Russia and China than Donald Trump.” Kosachev opined that Trump apparently considered his own agenda in dealing with Russia, China and America’s allies to be ""more important than keeping James Mattis at his post,"" concluding: ""That’s an interesting signal, and a more positive one” for Russia.
- Semyon Bagdasarov, director of the Moscow-based Center for Middle Eastern and Central Asian Studies, appearing on the Russian state TV show “The Evening with Vladimir Soloviev,” described the ultimate outcome of the U.S. withdrawal from Syria as “a total dream come true.” The host, Vladimir Soloviev, chimed in and predicted a massive picnic—“It will be a real celebration, in the best traditions!”
- State TV host Olga Skabeeva surmised that Americans are “losers, since Putin has defeated them in every way.” With a theatrical sigh, her co-host, Evgeny Popov, added: “Trump is ours again—what are you going to do?” Every member of the sizeable audience enthusiastically clapped. Russian opinion makers recount the Kremlin’s victories with unmistakable glee. Popov smirked: “It seems to Americans that we won on every front: the U.S. Secretary of Defense has been removed, we unquestionably secured a complete, unconditional victory in Syria. …On top of that, Rusal sanctions have been lifted with Trump’s hands.” Panelists of the show, including Russian lawmakers, couldn’t hide their satisfied grins.
- Discussing the planned departure of the U.S. from Syria, state TV host Olga Skabeeva pondered why Trump suddenly decided to leave at this point in time: “Americans say, it’s because he is beholden to Putin. Is that logical? Yes, it is.”

Regarding the most recent Syria pullout:

- “Putin won the lottery! Russia’s unexpected triumph in the Middle East,” raved Mikhail Rostovsky in his article for the Russian newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets. “Those who were convinced of Trump’s uselessness for Russia ought to think again...What Washington got out of this strange move is completely unclear. To the contrary, what Moscow gained from this is self-evident...Trump’s mistake in Syria is the unexpected ‘lottery win’ that further strengthened Moscow’s position in the Middle East and undermined America’s prestige as a rational political player and a reliable partner.”  
- Maksim Yusin, the editor of international politics at the leading Russian business daily Kommersant, was amazed by the ongoing stream of inexplicable actions by the American president that benefit the Kremlin. “All of this benefits the Russian Federation,” Yusin marveled. “You know, I’ve been watching Trump’s behavior lately and get seditious thoughts: maybe he really is a Russian agent? He is laboring so hard to strengthen the international image of Russia in general—and Putin in particular...In this situation, Americans—to their chagrin and our enjoyment—are the only losers in this situation.”
- “This is such a pleasure,” grinned Olga Skabeeva, the host of Russia’s state television program 60 Minutes. “Russian soldiers have taken an American base under our complete control, without a fight!” Skabeeva’s co-host Evgeny Popov added: “Suddenly, we have defeated everyone.” Incredulously, Skabeeva pointed out: “This is an American base—and they just ran away! Trump ran away!”
- “It’s been a long time since America has been humiliated this way,” gloated political analyst Mikhail Sinelnikov-Orishak, “They ran away in shame! I can’t recall such a scenario since Vietnam.” He added: “For us, this is of great interest, because this is a key region where energy prices are being determined. That is a shining cherry on top.” Political scientist Andrey Nikulin concurred: “This is sad for America. A smaller-scale version of what happened in Vietnam.”
- Appearing on the nightly television show The Evening with Vladimir Soloviev, political analyst Evgeny Satanovsky recounted many ways in which Trump’s decision to withdraw from Syria and abandon the Kurds has hurt the image and standing of the United States: “America betrayed everyone...Trump also strengthened the anti-American mood in Turkey, when he promised to destroy the Turkish economy.” Satanovsky opined that now any economic problems or currency fluctuations in Turkey can be blamed directly on the United States, prompting textile, tobacco, steel and other industries to turn away from America. “Anti-Americanism in Turkey is off the charts,” Satanovsky pointed out, “American politics are tangled in their own shoelaces... America is successfully self-eliminating from the region.”
- Discussing the exchanges between President Trump and President Erdoğan, Leonid Kalashnikov, Chairman of Russian State Duma Committee for the Commonwealth of Independent States affairs, commented: “I don’t care that those two clowns write such letters to each other. You can only pity them. Is it better for us that the Americans left Syria? Of course it is! Will we make deals with Erdoğan? Of course we will.”
- Vice President Mike Pence gave Erdoğan everything the Turkish side has been attempting to achieve, in exchange for a promised five-day pause in the offensive. A Turkish official told Middle East Eye, “We got exactly what we wanted out of the meeting.” At the conclusion of the five-day pause, Erdoğan will be meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Sochi.
- Appearing on 60 Minutes, Franz Klintsevich, a member of the Federation Council's Committee on Defense and Security, declared that Russia will take full advantage of America’s withdrawal from the Middle East, becoming a top player in the region. Klintsevich argued that America’s withdrawal from Syria represented Russia’s “global victory” and “demonstrated the absolute superiority of Russia’s arms, diplomacy and foreign policy.”
- During the same show, political analyst Mikhail Sinelnikov-Orishak was overcome with gratitude: “I look at Trump and think: ‘May God grant him good health—and another term. This is a great situation for Russia...We can practically sit back and reap the dividends from what others are doing...Meanwhile, Trump is yet to make a single good deal, which is why I wish him good health, may he flourish and get re-elected...Trump is a great candidate. I applaud him...For America, this isn’t a very good president.”
- The Kremlin’s propagandists see no acceptable alternative to Trump amongst any viable presidential candidates in the United States. Complaining about prevailing anti-Russian attitudes, Vladimir Soloviev—host of the nightly television show The Evening with Vladimir Soloviev—sarcastically surmised: “So it looks like we’ll have to elect your president—again.”

You guys liked my [list of the times the White House has altered official records](https://old.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/fvoryl/the_white_house_alters_official_records_a_list/?), so I thought I'd share another list I've been keeping.

#Trump’s Actions That Benefit Russia at America’s Expense

*What are the chances that it’s a coincidence that all of these things help Russia and hurt the US? Occam’s Razor suggests that Trump’s intention is to help Russia.*

To make this list, Trump's actions needed to fulfill two criteria: (1) benefit Russia; and (2) harm America. Feel free to add your own suggestions to help me fill out this list some more.

Trump ties to Putin:


An overview of Trump’s numerous ties to Russia

Trump was over a billion in debt and the Russians [bailed him out.](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/)

► Trump was first compromised by the Russians in the 80s. In 1984, the Russian Mafia began to use[ Trump real estate to launder money.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/is-there-a-case-for-trump-putin-collaboration-years-before-the-campaign/2018/08/16/00578f1e-9440-11e8-80e1-00e80e1fdf43_story.html) In 1987, the Soviet ambassador to the United Nations, Yuri Dubinin, arranged for Trump and his then-wife, Ivana, to enjoy an all-expense-paid trip to Moscow to consider possible business prospects. Only seven weeks after his trip, Trump ran full-page ads in the Boston Globe, the NYT and WaPO calling for, in effect, the dismantling of the postwar Western foreign policy alliance. The whole Trump/Russian connection started out as laundering money for the Russian mob through Trump's real estate, but evolved into something far bigger.

► In 1984, David Bogatin — a convicted Russian mobster and close ally of Semion Mogilevich, a major Russian mob boss — met with Trump in Trump Tower right after it opened. Bogatin bought five condos from Trump at that meeting. Those condos were later seized by the government, which claimed they were used to launder money for the Russian mob. ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/30/nyregion/entrepreneur-who-left-us-is-back-awaiting-sentence.html), Apr 30, 1992)

► [Felix Sater](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Sater ) is a Russian-born former mobster, and former managing director of NY real estate conglomerate Bayrock Group LLC located on the 24th floor of Trump Tower. [He is a convict who became a govt cooperator for the FBI and other agencies. ](https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-felix-sater-trump-associate-at-center-of-the-mueller-russia-probe-2018-11 ) He grew up with Michael Cohen--Trump's former ""fixer"" attorney. Cohen's family owned El Caribe, which was a mob hangout for the Russian Mafia in Brooklyn. Cohen had ties to Ukrainian oligarchs through his in-laws and his brother's in-laws. Felix Sater's father had ties to the Russian mob. This goes back more than 30 years.

► Trump was $4 billion in debt after his Atlantic City casinos went bankrupt. No U.S. bank would touch him. Then foreign money began flowing in through Bayrock (mentioned above). Bayrock was run by two investors: Tevfik Arif, a Kazakhstan-born former Soviet official who drew on bottomless sources of money from the former Soviet republic; and [Felix Sater, a Russian-born businessman who had pleaded guilty in the 1990s to a huge stock-fraud scheme involving the Russian mafia.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardbehar/2016/10/03/donald-trump-and-the-felon-inside-his-business-dealings-with-a-mob-connected-hustler/#873b09222824 ) Bayrock partnered with Trump in 2005 and poured money into the Trump organization under the legal guise of licensing his name and property management.

► In July 2008, the height of the housing bust, [Trump sold a mansion in Palm Beach for $95 million to Dmitry Rybolovlev,](https://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/20190217/trump-in-palm-beach-did-russian-mansion-buyer-make-money ) a Russian oligarch. Trump had purchased it four years earlier for $41.35 million. The sale price was nearly $54 million more than Trump had paid for the property. Again, this was the height of the recession when all other property had plummeted in value.

► Semion Mogilevich was the brains behind the Russian Mafia. [Mogilevich operatives have been using Trump real estate for decades to launder money.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/08/trumps-top-targets-in-the-russia-probe-are-experts-in-organized-crime/569056/) That means Russian Mafia operatives have been part of his fortune for years. Many of them owned condos in Trump Towers and other properties. They were running operations out of Trump's crown jewel.

► From Craig Unger's AMA: ""Early on, a source told me that all this was tied to Semion Mogilevich, the powerful Russian mobster. I had never even heard of him, but I immediately went to a database that listed the owners of all properties in NY state and looked up all the Trump properties. Every time I found a Russian sounding name, I would Google, and add Mogilevich. When you do investigative reporting, you anticipate drilling a number of dry holes, but almost everyone I googled turned out to be a Russian mobster. Again and again. If you know New York you don't expect Trump Tower to be a high crime neighborhood, but there were far too many Russian mobsters in Trump properties for it to be a coincidence.""

►  So many Russians bought Trump apartments at his developments in Florida that the area became known as Little Moscow. The developers of two of his hotels were Russians with significant links to the Russian mob. The late leader of that mob in the United States, Vyacheslav Kirillovich Ivankov, was [living at Trump Tower](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate)

► According to a [Bloomberg investigation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-16/behind-trump-s-russia-romance-there-s-a-tower-full-of-oligarchs ) (3/16/2017) into Trump World Tower,  “a third of units sold on floors 76 through 83 by 2004 involved people or limited liability companies connected to Russia and neighboring states.”

► In 2013, Federal agents busted an “ultraexclusive, high-stakes, illegal poker ring” run by Russian gangsters out of Trump Tower. They operated card games, illegal gambling websites, and a global sports book and laundered more than $100 million. [A condo directly below one owned by Trump reportedly served as HQ for a “sophisticated money-laundering scheme” connected to Semion Mogilevich.](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate)

► The Russia Mafia is part and parcel of Russian intelligence. [Russia is a mafia state.](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2018/05/19/inside-vladimir-putins-mafia-state ) That is not a metaphor. Putin is head of the Mafia. So the fact that they have been operating out of the home of the president of the United States is deeply disturbing.

►  Rudy Giuliani famously prosecuted the Italian mob while he was a federal prosecutor, yet the Russian mob was allowed to thrive. Now he's deeply entwined in the business of Trump and Russian oligarchs. Giuiani appointed Semyon Kislin to the NYC Economic Development Council in 1990, and the [FBI described Kislin as having ties to the Russian mob.](https://publicintegrity.org/politics/elections/fbi-tracked-alleged-russian-mob-ties-of-giuliani-campaign-supporter/ ) Of course, it made good political sense for Giuliani to get headlines for smashing the Italian mob.

► A lot of Republicans in Washington are implicated. Boatloads of Russian money went to the GOP--often in legal ways. [The NRA](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/27/764879242/nra-was-foreign-asset-to-russia-ahead-of-2016-new-senate-report-reveals ) got as much as $70M from Russia, then funneled it to the GOP. The Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee lead by McConnell [got millions from Leonard Blavatnik.](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/06/mcconnells-biggest-donor-isnt-russian/ ) In the 90s, the Russians began sending money to top GOP leaders, like Speaker of the House Tom Delay. Craig Unger's book alleges that most of the GOP leadership has been compromised by RU money.

► At the Cityscape USA’s Bridging US and the Emerging Real Estate Markets Conference held in Manhattan, on September 9, 10, and 11, 2008, Donald Trump Jr. was frank about the tide of Russian money supporting the family business, [saying ""...And in terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets.""](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-jr-said-money-pouring-in-from-russia-2018-2)

Yuzivska gas field has US$67 trillion dollars worth of natural gas (called ""tight gas"") it is not easily recoverable but it can be fracked and that technology is well-developed now. It is the second or third largest natural gas field in Europe and has not been heavily developed as shortly after its desicovery in 2010 Russia invaded the Donbas region of Ukraine and the nearby conflict prevented much interest in developing the field.  
It just really struck me at how its eastern border so closely matched the current conflict front lines.  
Also it made me wonder, how much that natural gas would have influenced Russia's decision to invade. Even if Russia doesn't develop the field, preventing it from being developed would ensure continued European dependence on Russian energy sales until Europe can further transition to non-fossil fuel based energy.

If so, then https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Countries/UA/Ukraine_13th_HRMMU_Report_3March2016.pdf has:

&gt; 25. [...] In Shyrokyne, a key location in the ‘grey zone’
between the Government-controlled city of Mariupol and the town of Novoazovsk controlled by the armed groups, OHCHR documented extensive use of civilian buildings and locations by the Ukrainian military and the Azov regiment, and looting of civilian property, leading to displacement.

&gt; 103. On 23 December, OHCHR met with four detainees held in Mariupol SIZO for their alleged involvement in the 9 May events. They complained that they had been ill-treated by SBU officials and members of the Azov regiment in Mariupol, detained incommunicado for some time in September 2014, and that evidence extracted through torture was being used in their trial. They added that they had been denied medical assistance for the injuries sustained through torture, and had ineffective legal representation. Of grave concern is the allegation that the accused suffered reprisals in the form of threats, intimidation and ill-treatment by the SBU after they challenged the admissibility of evidence in court.

&gt; 161. Another major concern is the ongoing presence of military forces in civilian areas and indiscriminate shelling continue to be the main factors endangering civilians, and affects their ability to access housing, land and property. During the reporting period, OHCHR collected detailed information about the conduct of hostilities by Ukrainian armed forces and the Azov regiment in and around Shyrokyne (31km east of Mariupol), from the summer of 2014 to date. Mass looting of civilian homes was documented, as well as targeting of civilian areas between September 2014 and February 2015. 

and https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Countries/UA/Ukraine_14th_HRMMU_Report.pdf has:

&gt; 49. [...] A man with a mental disability was subject to cruel treatment, rape and other forms of sexual violence by eight to 10 members of the ‘Azov’ and ‘Donbas’ battalions in August-September 2014.

&gt; 59. A resident of Mariupol was detained by three servicemen of the ‘Azov’
battalion on 28 January 2015 for supporting the ‘Donetsk people’s republic’. He was taken to the basement of Athletic School No. 61 in Mariupol, where he was held until 6 February 2015. He was continuously interrogated and tortured. He complained about being handcuffed to a metal rod and left hanging on it, he was reportedly tortured with electricity, gas mask and subjected to waterboarding and he was also beaten in his genitals. As a result he confessed about sharing information with the armed groups about the locations of the Government checkpoints. Only on 7 February, he was taken to the Mariupol SBU, where he was officially detained.

Both of those reports are from 2016; I haven't made an effort to see whether there are more recent ones. And I'm not trying to make a statement one way or the other about whether Azov is, or has been, *unusually* criminal, for a military unit of its size, engaged in the amount and the sort of fighting that it has been engaged in since 2014. Just pointing out the obvious that yes, there are *some* war crimes that have been committed by members of the Azov Battalion, in the course of their service in that organization.",43bfc6cd98abcb25825d05c48889dcb8c5e07d1e,True,False,,,,,0,1649304754,,0,{},i3q0c06,False,t3_txmev6,False,True,t1_i3o8375,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/txmev6/simple_explanation/i3q0c06/,1649304767,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1649275954.0,,,,
