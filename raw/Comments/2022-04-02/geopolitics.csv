The rest of the world has been, in my opinion, negotiating with Putin *in good faith*.  And they assume the same of him.  

But this whole exercise has shown he's NOT negotiating in good faith.  He talks a lot sure, but what does he actually SAY?  Two months ago he was swearing up and down that putting the majority of his military around UA was 'just an exercise' and 'he has no plans to invade UA' and only a crazy person would think he'd invade UA.  Then he invades UA to 'de-Nazify' it, which makes no freakin sense because UA is run by a Jew.  Then he says there'll be humanitarian corridors and the humanitarian corridors get bombed.  Then he says he won't target civilians or civvy infrastructure and he blows up a TV tower and entire blocks of apartment buildings and stores.  Now he 'pulls back as a good faith for negotiations' (aka, he's been driven out and retreats) only the 'pulling back' is apparently leaving the entire place wired to explode with mines and tripwires everywhere.  

I don't want WWIII.  I really don't.  But the last two months have (IMHO) demonstrated beyond any reasonable doubt or debate that appeasement is NOT a functional strategy with Putin, because everything UA and the rest of the world have done to appease Putin (including letting him have Crimea, and trading UA's nukes for security guarantees back in the 90s) obviously hasn't appeased him enough to not invade Ukraine.  

By my read, at this moment Putin is half schoolyard bully that will push people around to get what he wants, and half 5 year old.  Ever try negotiating with an obnoxious 5 year old?  They will say whatever it takes to get the candy bar, with no concept that promises made have to be kept.  And that may mean that the only way to stand up to him is with force.

I hope there's a more clever way out.

Let's take the first option where the EU pays in Euro. You are asking, why can't Russia just then convert it to Ruble. Well, what will happen if there is no Ruble in the market? 

Let's now take the other option where the EU pays to the bank in Euro, then the Russuan bank convert it to Ruble, and then the Russian bank pay the gas company. What will happen if there is no Ruble in the market? The Russian bank well tell the EU, sorry there is no Ruble in the market. Your payment is rejected. Go find Rubles, then come back. 

The EU here has few options: 
1. They can sell goods for Russia to get Rubles. 
2. Another person (some Chinese company) sees that the EU wants Rubles, so he goes to Russia, buy rubles for yen, and then sells it to the EU with a profit.

The first option will allow Russia to escape the sanctions and also create demand. The second option will create demand on the Ruble and would need 3rd party.

Let's imagine that I am the Chinese company. Let's say I sell orange juice. I can sell this orange juice to Russia to get Rubles or I can sell it to India to get Rupees.

Could human failings affect the truthiness of ""in sincere""?

Could they affect the quality of it's stated aims (and open a possibility that there ~are some unstated aims in play)?

Is ""sincerity"" a boolean?

&gt; But it's the best (and maybe only) game in town for preventing the worst (and generally predictable) abuses of a polity's monopoly on the use of force. 

When you say ""in town"", what are you referring to?  I understand the colloquial meaning, but I am interested in the technical meaning.

&gt; Distinguishing between liberal democracy and authoritarianism is, of course, just a functional and working taxonomy. 

Might ""just"" be doing a lot of work here?  And this word ""is"", what does it mean in this context, technically?

&gt; These things operate on a continuum; and while, for simplicity's sake, we focus on the one axis on which there is a continuum, there are other axes. It's always good to be mindful that one is operating at a lower resolution for efficiencies sake

a) How often do you think people realize they are operating at low resolution?  And do they even have access to high resolution, currently?

b) Might we be operating at low resolution for reasons other than efficiency?

&gt; and that one can go to a higher one when needed. 

a) How high?

b) Are you sure we even have well developed abilities in this domain?

&gt; Still, for now, this level of resolution seems justified. 

By what?  Laziness?  Lack of imagination?  Tradition, cultural norms and narratives?

&gt; Given the scale our polities now operate at, we tend to know how the movie ends every time that an individual or group get unlimited access to power in a state. And it doesn't end well. 


We also often imagine that we have such knowledge (""every time"" often extends into the future). 

&gt; So while there are many other problems to solve, surely we can agree to not go down this path.

I do not necessarily agree, depending on which path you are referring to.

&gt; Another core issue is scale, a problem derived from technology. We simply operate at inhuman(e) levels of scale with respect to our communities and polities. 

We do, but our methodology for operating at scale seems hilariously imperfect to me, and, improving upon the situation seems to be mostly not on the radar of anyone I've encountered.  Even worse: whenever I've mentioned this possibility, rare is the person who does not lose interest immediately, or suddenly become opposed to the very ideas they were promoting often even minutes before.

&gt; Why would you give Satan free reign in the most important areas of human existence, while only combating him in peripheral ones? 

This seems like a fine question to ask of the people driving the bus we are all riding in.

Perhaps, so far.  History is filled with things that didn't work, until they did.

&gt; A government of 350 Million people telling one individual what they should read or watch or wear or who to sleep with is a nightmare. 

I don't know if that's necessarily so harmful.  Besides, we could reduce ""telling"" to ""suggesting"" and that would remove a lot of risk I'd think.

[],False,,sotonohito,,,[],,,,text,t2_37jm9,False,False,"You're mixing polysci technical use of a term with casual American use of a term and that's what's causing your confusion here.  
Just as ""down"" in football technical usage means something different from what it means in casual conversation, so too do left and right mean different things in a polysci technical sense than they do in everyday conversation.  
You're 100% correct, when using casual terminology that the US Democratic Party is identified as left. But that's a really fuzzy term in casual usage, ask any ten people what it means and you'll get 20 different answers.  
This, BTW, isn't my opinion but the simply the technical terminology invented by political scientists when they classify political ideologies. It's not judgmental, but descriptive. Like vertebrate and invertebrate.  
Don't take my word for it, look at the Wikipedia entries for left wing politics and right wing politics \[1\] and you'll note that right there in the very first paragraph it says exactly what I did: right wing politics embraces hierarchy (or at least accepts it as inevitable/necessary), left wing politics rejects hierarchy.  
That's why despite both Stalinism and Fascism being murderous and authoritarian ideologies centered on political violence we class Stalinism as left wing and Fascism as right wing. Their core tenants differed in an essential way, and we see that reflected in the language used.  
The habitual use of Comrade as a prefix in Stalinism reflects the hypothetical ideal of a flat society, there might be a foreman at a factory but ideologically that foreman was supposed to be the social equal of everyone else. You can argue that Stalinism failed miserably at actually enacting a non-hierarchal society, and I'd agree, but that was the theoretical ideal it claims to have sought after.  
In Fascist nations the opposite was the case. There was an explicit endorsement of a social hierarchy based on race, religion, skin color, wealth, and class. Fascism is centered on the establishment of a hierarchy and an elite to rule it.  
Liberalism, even in polysci, is somewhat vaguely defined, but both the American Republican and Democratic parties classify as ""liberal"" under standard definitions. Fukuyama's thesis in End of History was rooted in the fact that liberalism, in the polysci sense of ""a general belief in the rights of the individual, consent of the governed, and equality before the law"" is quite widespread worldwide and when he wrote the book appeared to be poised on total victory over other ideologies. China has something to say about that.  
In theory both left and right can be liberal, or conservative, authoritarian or libertarian. Just as a vertebrate can be warm or cold blooded and (in theory) an invertebrate could be warm blooded (though to date none have been discovered). The definitions of each term don't cover the same traits covered by other terms.  
By polysci terms both the Democratic and Republican Parties are right wing, in that both endorse and to one extent or another embrace a hierarchal society. The Democrats, as the leftists like to joke, don't want to abolish billionaires they just want nicer billionaires. The Democrats are center right as they're a bit squishy on hierarchy and would like to have it be a kinder, gentler, hierarchy. The Republicans are more pure right or far right due to their more fervent embrace of hierarchy and a greater indifference to the suffering of those closer to the bottom of the hierarchy.  
But both are right wing in the technical sense of the the word.

But as to your larger point, which is whether there is any kind of broad movement to address the death of spirit that seems to arise wherever modernity prevails, in whatever form, I agree that things do not look great right now. Runaway technology that we simply lack the moral capacity to control, particularly unassisted on the individual level, is perhaps the central culprit. Liberalism aggravates this problem as it frustrates any group effort to succeed in resisting temptations that the individual cannot. Liberalism not only exalts and facilitates the atomicized individual, but it deprives the community of any teeth. And sometimes teeth are needed. 

Another core issue is scale, a problem derived from technology. We simply operate at inhuman(e) levels of scale with respect to our communities and polities. This creates many perversions. One weird inversion is that I actually believe that atomic individuals do not thrive; and that does mean that the group sometimes needs to use coercive force to impede degenerate behavior, and that includes group 'interference' in activities that liberals consider to be the most private of domains, such as sexuality, relationships, what we wear, what we read and think.

""is sincere in its aims""....such a simple, seemingly innocuous statement...but might this appearance be deceiving?

&gt; The real issue is that the LIO and the nations backing it are also the prime source of the the most spiritually deadening lifestyle ever seen by man, and the LIO has been the perfect transmission mechanism. 

I don't disagree, but this seems more like a symptom or consequence of a deeper problem to me.

&gt; Not that they were trying to be so, but just that the flaws in the system also impeded optima Brave New World technology creation and exploitation. 

Agree!!  How big of a problem do we have with this, and what percentage of this problem is seen, and on our radar of priorities?  I'm thinking somewhere in the neighbourhood of 0%.

&gt; That said, the reason I believe in the LIO still is that it seems to me that it is the direction we have to go. Along its path is the problem we have to solve. 

Agree....do you think ~""optimizing the path"" is even on humanity's radar in any substantial way?  I don't.  Rather, I truly believe that *not doing that* is the guiding principle of much of the power class.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The four-stroke regime is a two-story state. When people hear one story, they tend to ask: is this true? When they hear two stories, they tend to ask: which one of these is true? Isn’t this a neat trick? Maybe our whole world is built on it. Any point on which both poles concur is shared story: “uncontroversial, bipartisan consensus.”
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Shared story has root privilege. It has no natural enemies and is automatically true. Injecting ideas into it is nontrivial and hence lucrative; this profession is called “PR.”
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; There is no reason to assume that either pole of the spectrum of conflict, or the middle, or the shared story, is any closer to reality than the single pole of the one-story state.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Dividing the narrative has not answered the old question: is any of this true? Rather, it has… dodged it. Stagecraft!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is even better than supposing that, since we fought Hitler and Hitler was bad, we must be good. These very basic fallacies, or psychological exploits, are deeply embedded in our political operating systems. Like bugs in code, they are invisible until you look straight at them. Then they are obvious.

&gt; I get that Fukuyama is really soft-pedalling the issues with Liberal Enlightenment thinking, keeping it abstract and generalized. It could be that this is not the best way to communicate it. Still, as we agree, he is on point.

At best, I think he is in the right general neighbourhood....and that *only maybe*.

&gt; I also agree with him that we will need some of the key tenets of Liberal Enlightenment thinking. 

Does anyone even know what those are, or take them adequately seriously?

&gt; I mean it's no good saving the soul if we destroy all the bodies. He is pretty fuzzy on the kinds of compromises needed to reconcile liberal Enlightenment ideals with a healthier life, though. Can't entirely blame him--his essay can only be so long, and it is a complex subject that we have barely begun to explore seriously. I do think, however, that there can be a reconciliation.

The real issue is that the LIO and the nations backing it are also the prime source of the the most spiritually deadening lifestyle ever seen by man, and the LIO has been the perfect transmission mechanism. Hell, in many ways, life under Soviet communism was more spiritually fulfilling. Not that they were trying to be so, but just that the flaws in the system also impeded optima Brave New World technology creation and exploitation. 

That said, the reason I believe in the LIO still is that it seems to me that it is the direction we have to go. Along its path is the problem we have to solve. The more competent authoritarians are creating their own version of Disneyland/Brave New World spirit and soul destruction, and it isn't any better. Eventually, you will get the worst of Soviet-style totalitarian soul destruction combined with an equally  virulent form of the modernity spirit-virus. 

I get that Fukuyama is really soft-pedalling the issues with Liberal Enlightenment thinking, keeping it abstract and generalized. It could be that this is not the best way to communicate it. Still, as we agree, he is on point. 

I also agree with him that we will need some of the key tenets of Liberal Enlightenment thinking. I mean it's no good saving the soul if we destroy all the bodies. He is pretty fuzzy on the kinds of compromises needed to reconcile liberal Enlightenment ideals with a healthier life, though.

One is they require many muslims kids over 1 year old to attend a minimum of 25 hours a week in an approved school for assimilation instruction into the Dutch culture.  That’s diversity.

If anything, the US needs the LIO less than many if not most members. And while India has been fairly self-sustaining relative to other LIO beneficiaries, it will benefit more from the organization as it modernizes. 

The only thing that could put India's interests at seeming odds with the LIO would be if the government decides it needs to become more authoritarian than the LIO is comfortable with in order to hold India together and/or accelerate development.

Believe me, this is a neutral view. If I were pushing a greek agenda, I would describe much worse things. But you can't deny the objective truth. The Turkish mindset indeed perceives as weakness the inability of the west to impose themselves, which is why they keep pushing the limits. I am not demonifying Turkey here, but this is what really happens, whether you like it or not. I swear you people become upset, when someone says something mildly infuriating about your beloved fatherland. You should try and see things from an objective point of view. But, you may not like it, since in the objective scope Turkey is not an angelic state of nobel people and leaders, with a holy purpose, as your media makes you think you are. There's a reason why NATO wants Turkey. They get the dirty job done for them. And I mean really dirty. Turkey is willing to send troops, clash, as well as to commit, what we would call, war crimes, while European countries are not willing to do so. Which is why they keep exploiting Turkey as a member of NATO, to keep doing what they do.

&gt;You know only Erdogan supporters and Greek nationalists think Erdogan is a capable politician and wrap western politicians on his finder.

Well, he is a great politician, but not a great leader. He manages to play Putin like a fiddle, while at the same time shows Turkey's teeth to Europe. Maybe he doesn't care for the benefit of the Turkish people and he thinks he is a Sultan, but good grace, as a politician he achieved many things. Still, that doesn't make him a great leader.

&gt;You could have easily researched and find out half of Turkey's wheat imports comes from Russia and the other half is mostly from Ukraine. Until you people manage to find a way to cover that without skyrocketing bread prices Turkey will continue to not sanction Russia.

I have. In fact, what you quoted from my previous comment is simply a shortened expression of what you said. Perhaps you're right, I should have elaborated more on that. Realistically, Turkey can't put sanctions on Russia for various reasons, including Turkey's ability to profit from this war, but this also gives the west another pressure point, when it comes to negotiations with a shrewd Erdogan.

&gt;But oh no, god forbid Turks see a possible western help as weakness because that's how we are. Thank you for non biased takes.

Never said that. In short, I claimed ""Turkey perceives the inability of the West to impose sanctions on them, or their indecisiveness and inaction on the matter of Ukraine, as weakness"".

Points I agree with:

*- Liberalism still needs to provide for its existence, which means it needs to be able to form a nation*.

I've always thought that the notion liberalism is so inherently good (in Fukuyama's words 'universality') that it changes the survival game of the nature was a bit naive.  Liberalism is not a game changer.  In fact, it is the survival game that is immutable.  Liberalism will exist/thrive or die based on its merit in playing this game.

Liberalism framework has several advantages in constructing and sustaining a nation.  Full access to its population for talent pool from which leaders (political, military, economy) and artisans (scientists, doctors, lawyers, etc.) can be drawn.  More efficient mobilization of resources for wars.  Less susceptibility to making grossly poor decisions that can wreck the nation.

As with any human organization, the merit a nation will depend on both its design concept and implementation details.  If you implement a liberal nation where these potential advantages are fully realized, then the nation is likely to be successful.  OTOH, if you implement a liberal nation that ignores these advantages, that nation is likely to fail, especially if there are other neighboring illiberal competitor nations that are well implemented to its own design potentials.  

This is what makes me nervous about modern liberalism movement: ignoring/confusing what gives liberal nations its power.

&amp;#x200B;

*- Forming nationhood based on liberalism framework is challenging, since nationhood based on race, culture, and religion seem more inline with social nature of human being.*

Historically, most successful human societies have been nations formed based on common shared experience (usually painful struggle).  Because mobility has been limited in the past, people of shared experience are also people of the same race, culture, and religion.  Practice of forming nationhood at least partially based on liberal framework is fairly recent (approx 2 centuries), and forming nationhood purely based on liberalism, in my opinion, is very recent (30-40 yrs).  

The shared experience that forms the basis of US nationhood includes war of independence, westward expansion, fighting world wars.  There is a big overlap between people with these experience and Anglo Americans.  US is not a nation based soley on liberalism principles.  

As the nation has gotten more diverse, we are trying to form a new nationhood based on liberal principles only, because a big part of US population do not share experiences listed above, and we've lost the foundational narrative.  I think we are on an uncharted territory.  I would like to think this is possible, but I have to also acknowledge that this effort could fail, and the current regime in US may not survive this effort.

============================

Points I disagree with:

*- Fight for freedom in Ukraine and fight for liberalism in US are the same.*

I think these are struggles of entirely different nature.  

Ukrainian people already have shared history, and the current war is strengthening this foundation of their nationhood.  They just need to play the survival game well.

US political division is a search for the foundation of nationhood, without any external existential threat.",3749a8e05defd10a2323c2d80d10c84cb9c5c9a0,True,False,,,,,0,1648870888,,0,{},i32icb8,False,t3_ttqahr,False,True,t3_ttqahr,/r/geopolitics/comments/ttqahr/francis_fukuyama_liberalism_needs_the_nation/i32icb8/,1648870903,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648842088.0
