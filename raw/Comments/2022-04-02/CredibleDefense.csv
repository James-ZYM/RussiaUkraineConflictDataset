That said, I agree that Central Asia and the Caucuses are a much more viable place to put on wars for internal political purposes due to having fewer western eyeballs on them. 

I'm also thinking one consequence of this war will be a growth of a NATO-aligned periphery, where countries aren't given anything like actual NATO membership, but have assurances on weapons supply should a clearly-defined subset of their neighbors invade. You'd also provide them widespread training on those systems, likely during a sort of short-term conscription. Sure the capabilities of a ex-conscript on those systems would wane over time, but they'd be much easier to train in the event of an invasion.

Ukraine really didn't need stockpiles of ATGMs and MANPADS before this war, nor did they need large numbers of F-16s that they'd need to spend money and labor to keep operational. What they actually need was large enough numbers of people trained on those systems and assurance that NATO stockpiles would be dumped into the country should Russia invade. The deterrent effect of that being a publicly expressed agreement will be massive when other leaders with expansionist aims take lessons from Ukraine. Additionally, it gives NATO a lot more carrots and sticks to hold over countries who want that sort of alignment

The following is an incredibly premature take on a war that we're not even on the 6th week of, and shouldn't be taken fully at face value: If the GW""OT"" and Syrian Civil war showed us the extent to which insurgencies can frustrate the goals of state armies, what Ukraine is showing is the potential of using state armies as a well organized insurgency.

“Key Takeaways

Russian forces continued to capture territory in central Mariupol on April 2 and will likely capture the city within days.
Ukrainian forces repelled several possibly large-scale Russian assaults in Donbas, claiming to destroy almost 70 Russian vehicles.
Russian forces will likely require a lengthy operational pause to integrate reinforcements into existing force structures in eastern Ukraine and enable successful operations but appear unlikely to do so and will continue to bleed their forces in ineffective daily attacks.
Russian forces in Izyum conducted an operational pause after successfully capturing the city on April 1 and will likely resume offensive operations to link up with Russian forces in Donbas in the coming days.
Russia continued to withdraw forces from the Kyiv axis into Belarus and Russia. Ukrainian forces primarily conducted operations to sweep and clear previously Russian-occupied territory.
Ukrainian forces likely repelled limited Russian attacks in Kherson Oblast.
The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces have rendered two-thirds of the 75 Russian Battalion Tactical Groups it assesses have fought in Ukraine either temporarily or permanently combat ineffective.”",4a12743b7e8b9f03226a0668660eca9028a89308,True,False,,,,,0,1648943937,,0,{},i361pcz,False,t3_tuh4fq,False,True,t3_tuh4fq,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tuh4fq/ukraine_megathread_april_2/i361pcz/,1648943953,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648915137.0,

That may be. It may also not be. It's not like Russia uses a tactical strike on Ukraine, then NATO respond in kind and everyone just goes nuts and all cities in Europe and North America are annihilated. The temperature would be through the roof, but MAD won't happen instantly.

&gt;  NATO has strong incentives to avoid this chain of events, to say the least.

True, but so does Russia. And a nuclear strike by Russia would show a willingness to fight NATO directly. It's why it's almost definitely not going to happen. Even with a Russian military collapse on all fronts (which is probably not going to happen either).

2. It's on the onus of those who believe it did not to prove it was staged by the Ukrainian government.

[],False,,NutDraw,,,[],,,,text,t2_ir5jw,False,False,"It's an interesting thought experiment, but ultimately I think it fails on its premise in accepting Russia's position regarding NATO expansion in good faith. After numerous examples, it's abundantly clear that Russia wasn't afraid of any offensive threat posed by NATO. Russia's nuclear deterrent would be more than enough to keep any western aggression at bay, to say nothing of the historical difficulty of traditional incursions into their territory.

Russia has always opposed NATO expansion, not because they fear an offensive from the west, **but because it is an effective obstacle to Russian expansion and the recapture of former Soviet territory.** Russia's previous actions in Ukraine should make it clear, *along with the statements of Putin and other Russian elites,* that returning Ukraine to the Russian fold was a long term goal of the regime. This makes the premise of the article that Putin was using coersive diplomacy and threatening invasion *just* to extract concessions from NATO much weaker, especially considering the increasing unreasonableness of those demands. The author is really just repeating the mistake western analysis made for decades leading up to the invasion by not taking Russia's imperial ambitions seriously despite mountains of evidence.

The search for answers regarding the gap between the expectations and reality of the Russian military's performance is understandable. But an impulsive decision to invade just seems terribly unlikely. Russia could have withdrawn its forces before the invasion with no consequences. Indeed, it would have just been par for the course. To me, this seems more and more like a coup gone wrong. Troops advancing on Kiev weren't expecting resistance so didn't prepare for it (in contrast to the south where Russian force composition more closely matched the war being fought and resistance was likely anticipated even after the government fell). Of course, the decapitation/coup failed, and it appears Ukraine successfully exploited weaknesses in Russian communication and command structure to keep Russian forces in the dark about the coup's failure.

I don't know how fighting in southern Iraq went. My understanding is that is was fairly calm at least during the first year of the war. The shia milita fighting culture would have been very different and I'm not sure how much Iran's support played a role.

Baghdad wouldn't be a good place to study because it is such a mixed city. Additionally, the Kurdish fighting culture in the north was probably very different too but they largely weren't attacking US troops. Most the action in the north was against Sunni ex-Saddam army types in Mosul, Tikrit, etc.

A study of both the Sunni region in the West and the Shia region in the south is complicated by the fact that some(?) or many(?) fighters were foreign fighters (from Iran in the south and from Syria, Saudi, Afghanistan, etc. in the west).",a5ecdf0c1c12bd2ed5168a053374b8efaca25e98,True,False,,,,,0,1648939531,,0,{},i35sqpj,False,t3_tqno01,False,True,t1_i2ohtcs,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tqno01/the_effectiveness_of_rifle_fire_across_cultures/i35sqpj/,1648939549,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648910731.0,

A very strange quirk of the 1979 conflict is that it is purposely suppressed by the Vietnamese government. The following article is a strange read of a totalitarian government trying to erase an entire war from the country's collective memory.

You are fundumentally missing why the post-ww2 western order has been so remarkable in relation to the rest of history. At the heart of liberal democratic thought is the recognition that geopolitics isn't a zero sum game. The transatlantic alliance defends democracies and free market economies because welcoming a new nation into the global order benefits the others. Germany and Japan were once client states at the fringes of this order. Now they are the third and fourth largest economies in the world, and I, an American, can get in my well made German car to go buy an affordable Japanese TV.

Juxtapose that with Putin's world view. It harkens back to a bygone era of thought where all resources are limited and as such weaker nations need to be dominated in order to have a bigger slice of global prosperity. In this ideology, great powers can only have non-overlapping spheres of incidence, and diplomatic or military force must be applied to settle disputes.

I don't want to discount that the West can still be imperialistic and undemocratic at times. As an American, the Invasion of Iraq and pretty much all the CIA's actions in Latin America are great examples of us getting it wrong. Democracies are inherently messy and are at times plauged by corruption and inefficiency.

This probably exists in every military to some extent, but bullying and hazing seems especially bad in the Russian military. It used to be worse because it's mostly senior conscripts abusing fresh conscripts, and service length was reduced from 2 years to 1 year, but it's still pretty bad. Beatings and extortion is common. There are old videos of this [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkRiDVV4IGA). Nowadays this footage doesn't come out anymore since it makes conscription even more unpopular among the Russian public, and the Russian government banned military personnel from using smartphones and anything that can connect to the internet.

In 2019 a conscript [killed 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorny_shooting) fellow soldiers because he couldn't take the hazing/bullying anymore. He couldn't go to anyone since the officers don't care unless it makes them look bad. So all in all these conscripts don't want to be there, they get paid peanuts, and they're treated like they're in prison. Morale must be terribly low.

I'm beginning to think that excessive Putin and Russian nationalism, given this point in the war may be the best case. If Putin is driven by nationalism, then he'll want a Russian society remaining after the conflict, and he may well understand that escalation won't give Russia that.

What it looks to me now is that Russia is falling back to its old tried and true strategy of seizing as much territory as possible and then relying on that fait accompli on the negotiating table. 

We know that sanctions are biting, but it is nowhere near hard enough to [really incite civil unrest](https://youtu.be/fZxbzPLfrqc) (note that this is just one example, there are many other street interviews out there where Russians aren't really that affected at all). Also the fact that all the financial penalties so far have been really caveated, e.g. Mastercard and Visa pullout was only for Russian cards being used overseas, and SWIFT only kicked out 7 banks out of 300. The west could send Russia back to the stone age but have so far resisted doing so.

So where does that leave us? Russia will soon control the entire sea of azov coastline and the donbass. They'll probably sue for peace, but those are terms the Ukrainians won't accept. But the amount of aid we're sending them right now, there's not much they can do about it.

[],False,,Xyzzyzzyzzy,,,[],,,,text,t2_6qgej2g0,False,False,"I think this (plus your next comment) is a great explanation of the Chinese perspective after the war. Vietnam was getting too big for its britches; the child needed to be spanked. It was pursuing an increasingly adventurous and independent foreign policy, it was aligned too closely with the Soviet Union, and its economy was growing too quickly. So China, as its sober and responsible neighbor, needed to teach Vietnam a lesson.

I think the problem is that this unquestioningly accepts the post-war Chinese story of what its war aims were. Like Russia in Ukraine, China was fairly vague in communicating its war goals before and during the conflict, and so a broad range of possible outcomes would have allowed it to claim that its goals had been achieved.

But contrary to the post-war Chinese story, there *was* a pretty clear objective that we can reasonably deduce they intended to achieve by military means: forcing Vietnam to withdraw from Cambodia and restoring the Khmer Rouge to power. Vietnam had invaded and occupied Cambodia and overthrown the Khmer Rouge less than a year prior. China did not achieve this objective; Vietnam occupied Cambodia until the 1990s, and the Khmer Rouge was (thankfully) never restored to power. 

Russia in Ukraine has (or had) some clearly deducible war goals - remove the Zelenskyy government, install one that would answer to the Kremlin, make the entire Donbass *de facto* Russian territory. But like China in Vietnam, Russia's publicly stated goals are far more vague. China was able to disengage at a time of its choosing and claim that it had achieved its goal of ""teaching Vietnam a lesson"".

I ran across a great response to it on Twitter from a credible source and I thought people should read it.

There is a great thread on Twitter by Christopher M. Dougherty who is the Senior Fellow on the Defense Team and Co-Lead of the Gaming Lab at the Center for a New American Security.

I highly recommend it, as it is the best response to the article that I have read yet.

https://twitter.com/C_M_Dougherty/status/1509910414330638344

https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1509910414330638344.html

I respect @PhillipsPOBrien's work, &amp; I recommend his book How the War Was Won to everyone (seriously, go read it). I also think he makes some great points in this article. However, there are some key misconceptions that matter for improving military analysis. 1/His argument is that western military analysts overestimated Russian advantages vs. Ukrainian forces b/c they fixated on weapons and doctrine and ignored factors--like logistics, leadership, and morale--that really matter. In the 🧵 below, I'll explain why I partly disagree.

2/ I'm not a Russia analyst, but my Pentagon job and work @CNASdc translates the work of experts like @KofmanMichael, @MassDara, @SamBendett, &amp; @schlickw into policies, strategies, concepts, etc. If the US got Russia wrong, I'm partly to blame, so far as a nameless boffin can be.

3/ Generally, I think we got some things right, and some things wrong. Mostly, however, I think we've been gobsmacked by the fact that Russian operations look nothing like their doctrine or exercises. This is why O'Brien's analogy to the Battle of France is inapt.

4/ France's defeat in 1940 remains a topic of debate 80 years later. But most analysts attribute it to a bad plan driven by rigid, outdated doctrine and rigid, outdated leaders, and based on flawed assumptions German plans &amp; the character of mechanized warfare. 5/ For more on France's failure, Marc Bloch's Strange Defeat is a great starting point: amazon.com/dp/B09LF3JV8D/…

5/ https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09LF3JV8D/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1 But Robert Doughty's ""Seeds of Disaster,"" is more pertinent, arguing that France lost because it rigidly followed its flawed Methodical Battle doctrine in what became a fluid, dynamic battle. amazon.com/Seeds-Disaster….

6/ https://www.amazon.com/Seeds-Disaster-Development-Doctrine-1919-1939/dp/0208020969 There are similarities w/Ukraine--flawed assumptions, bad plans, &amp; poor leadership. But there's a big difference: France failed because it followed bad doctrine. Russia's failing in part because it's not following its doctrine, or basic principles of war like unity of command.

7/ O'Brien argues that western analysts erred partly because they focused too much on doctrine, but how were these analysts to predict that the Russians would just throw doctrine and principles of warfare out the window? How else should they assess Russian forces?

8/ O'Brien says analysts need to look past that to assess the ability execute complex operations, support them logistically, and ensure that personnel are motivated and well led. I wholeheartedly agree that defense analysis needs to focus on these areas but...

9/ The Russian analysts I've worked with always cited these issues. I led a project years ago looking at Russian military weaknesses and how best to exploit them for deterrence and advantage in combat.

10/ I'll never forget @MassDara saying that Russia would struggle with C2 and logistics for any complex operation. These concerns were partly why @KofmanMichael found some Russia-NATO wargames unrealistic, as they posited massive invasions that Russia likely couldn't pull off.

11/ Most western analysis I've read, and my work @CNASdc, examines limited Russian incursions into NATO. The kind of operation that would minimize Russian weaknesses in C2, logistics, airpower, etc. We've spent relatively less time thinking about a massive invasion like Ukraine.

12/ But to the extent that we did, we thought it would be challenging for Russian logistics, C2, and airpower, but they'd follow their doctrine and execute plans that maximize their strengths like fires and numerical superiority.

13/ Instead, Russia's initial plan for Ukraine minimized its strengths and maximized its weaknesses by not following its doctrine. They didn't fight in BTGs, they didn't use fires to support maneuver, they didn't use precision strikes to suppress UKR airpower. It's bonkers.

14/ This is why the France 1940 analogy doesn't work. France failed because its plans followed bad doctrine and its leaders couldn't adapt. Russia's failing because it's not following its doctrine and its plans are insane and its leaders appear unable to adapt.

15/ So what lessons should analysts and those that use their work take away? 1) leadership matters, from the national level down to tactical units. Bad leaders tend to make bad plans and then can't adapt fast enough. They also tend to have poorly motivated subordinates.

16/ This is a sensitive topic though. Saying, ""the Russians have weak leadership and are unmotivated"" is a stone's throw from past racist attitudes that led analysts to underestimate opponents like Japan or Vietnam. It can also be a hard thing to assess.

17/ Still, I think analysts should examine operations and exercises to see, for example, if officers have to carry out or directly oversee basic tasks because they can't/won't trust subordinates. This distrust is crippling in combat.

18/ 2) We need to think more holistically, both about adversaries and ourselves. We tend to focus on individual systems, rather than the whole apparatus needed to make them work. C2 and logistics matter as much or more than fighters, tanks, ships, and missiles.

19/ 3) We need to analyze systems in realistic combat conditions. How a weapon/unit performs when it's dirty, disrupted, or degraded is way more relevant than its parade-ground appearance.

20/ 4) We need to expand our mental models beyond a handful of scenarios. Most analysis is scenario-specific. This can help bound assumptions and ensure strategic relevance. But it also limits our thinking and our ability to adapt &amp; plan for the unexpected.

21/ 5) We must be explicit about assumptions and examine them rigorously. About our adversaries. About ourselves. About allies and partners. About the character of warfare. Then we need to re-check them. We need to be open to people--even outsiders--who question our assumptions.

22/ 6) US analysts must remember that war is hard. Decades of US operational and tactical success (strategy, not so much) have created unrealistic expectations about warfare. RUS-UKR is what happens when the capability gap isn't huge.

23/ Despite these lessons and clear overestimation of Russian performance, I prefer these mistakes to the alternative. Overestimation of a foe leads to misallocation of resources. Underestimation of a foe, as Russia is discovering, leads to catastrophe.",4748909d13ca333c04ac90958edb8d95400bd89a,True,False,,,,,0,1648921293,,0,{},i34qj9u,False,t3_tuh4fq,False,True,t3_tuh4fq,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tuh4fq/ukraine_megathread_april_2/i34qj9u/,1648921305,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648892493.0,

&gt; James Siebens is a fellow with the Defense Strategy and Planning program at the nonpartisan Stimson Center, and an editor of Military Coercion and U.S. Foreign Policy: The Use of Force Short of War (Routledge 2020). He is currently working on a study of Chinese military coercion.

The 'about' page of the *War on the Rocks* website:

https://warontherocks.com/about/

&gt; War on the Rocks is a platform for analysis and debate on strategy, defense, and foreign affairs. It features articles and podcasts produced by an array of writers with deep experience in these matters: top notch scholars who study war, those who have served or worked in war zones, and more than a few who have done it all.

------------------

Quote from the article:

&gt; Rather than interpreting the invasion as proof of Putin’s revanchist ambitions, or of secret plans to conquer the former-Soviet “near-abroad” by force, policymakers, analysts, and other observers should consider an alternate hypothesis: that Putin intended, and indeed expected, to achieve his political aims merely by presenting a highly credible threat. As Charles Michel, the president of the European Council aptly put it, Putin was attempting to commit “geopolitical terrorism,” holding Ukraine hostage in order to coerce its leaders, the United States, and NATO to meet his political demands. The invasion may have been the cruel consequence of Putin’s failed coercive diplomacy, and evidence of an inept strategist at the helm of the Russian state.

-----------------

My submission statement:

I enjoyed this article because it made me think about the cause for the war in Ukraine in a different way. It is an intriguing theory, that makes sense to this layman when looking at the run up to the war. Dictators are used to getting whatever they want through threats. And if you are a dictator for twenty years then it is possible that you are used to getting whatever you want and have lost touch with reality.",53f94011cdcb15847a329cac1bf95d6aecf7bf60,True,False,,,,,0,1648920254,,0,{},i34o3kr,True,t3_tunwcc,False,True,t3_tunwcc,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tunwcc/is_russias_invasion_a_case_of_coercive_diplomacy/i34o3kr/,1648920271,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648891454.0,

Ukraine continues to belong to them, in their minds, despite what the map may show. Putin obviously has this attitude, but I think it’s a common sentiment in the Russian populace as well. The Russian Orthodox Patriarch compared Ukraine to the story of the prodigal son, a wayward youth who has taken his “inheritance”(Ukraine itself) and wasted it on “whores” (the decadent West). You see common support for the mission of “denazifying” Ukraine, as if it is incapable of running its own government or policing its people. Instead of believing the words of their friends and family actually on the ground in Kharkiv and other cities, they believe what the Kremlin tells them. They deny Ukrainians all agency in determining their own fate or what they desire if it goes against Russian beliefs. 

So I think it’s less that Russians support “war” per se as much as they support what they see as a righting of a historical/cultural wrong. They are scandalized that the Ukrainians are seeking to integrate with the West as a direct rejection of Russian cultural overlordship and then dare to fight back against their “discipline.” At the end of the day, I think the Russians believe Ukraine *deserves* this and that after they’ve been sufficiently chastised, they will come back to Russia and beg for forgiveness and reintegration into the Russian World.",d7447b7436ffe0a5322aa25dd2376f74de2fe6b7,True,False,,,,,0,1648916598,,0,{},i34fkkc,False,t3_tuh4fq,False,True,t1_i344noq,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tuh4fq/ukraine_megathread_april_2/i34fkkc/,1648916616,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648887798.0,

At a certain point, those F-16's only need to be more effective than having the pilots sitting around drinking tea.  Even if they'd be significantly more effective with better training, that's not a difficult bar to cross.

And they are going against a Russian Airforce that clearly doesn't have the best training or equipment.  So if Ukraine can take off and land the things, they may pose enough of a threat to largely keep the RuAF out of Ukraine's skies because the Russians don't want to risk Ukraine getting a lucky shot.

That said, Russian forces further away from the front and/or closer to the border of Belarus might have escaped relatively unscathed.

At any rate, I would speculate that the Russians still have enough troops and hardware to *attempt* to regroup and renew the attack at a later date (not necessarily against Kyiv).

[],False,,Jack15911,,,[],,,,text,t2_8klhd,False,False,"&gt; Ukrainian Air Force has claimed on twitter that they could effectively use F-15 or F-16 within two to three weeks of training, but everyone who knows their way around military aviation seems to agree that that's wildly optimistic. 

The US Air Force (USAF) really hates to change any pilot to any new aircraft and so makes it seem as if it can't be done unless they're getting rid of the aircraft type. Basically, if they let one pilot leave his slot they then have to train two pilots (they hate that), one for the new aircraft and another to replace the one who's leaving. That doesn't seem to be an issue for UAF, as they probably won't be buying MiGs in the future.

Another aspect is the level of training. USAF pilots are trained up to at least a minimal level on all(?) of the varied missions an active squadron will need. Examples might be air to air with guns, IR missiles, and radar missiles, dumb bombs, smart bombs by type, air refueling, low level, ECM, and much else. UAF could get by initially with air to air guns and IR missiles, cutting the flying training by a lot. Weeks, maybe not, but a few months, probably. Minimize the escalation issue by not teaching them how to drop bombs, maybe, and cut the training time way down. Large-scale combined arms training doesn't appear to be necessary as the Russians don't do it either.

More difficulty will be maintenance. The US model requires a strong NCO-based system. I have no idea if that's been changed in the previous eight years, but Ukraine probably used the Russian ""officers-do-the-real-work,"" (or warrant officers with no real authority) model, at least until recently. (Guesswork on my part.) In the past, at least, an aircraft mechanic had to have his repair manual opened to the right page when he worked on something, and that requires real professional discipline. You can replace a part of this with Zoom calls when work is needed, but not all of it.

I think that maintenance would be the hardest part of gaining Western aircraft. Something like the easy-to-maintain F-5 with air-to-air capability would work - they had surprisingly good aerodynamics against Soviet fighter types, I understand. The easiest of today's aircraft to maintain, I understand, is the Swedish Gripen - one NCO and four conscripts to rearms and refuel, or to change an engine, park it in a large garage, and take off and land from a short highway. There's no old stock of them, so they'd have to be new purchase, so I suspect that's out. The USAF has lots of F-16 aircraft available, though. 

A new aircraft type is difficult in war time, but there's no question Ukraine needs cover against Russian fighters in order to mass enough ground troops for large counterattacks.",131d60aae45702922208f598b35e05c68ae5ccd3,True,False,,,,,0,1648910835,,0,{},i342z0y,False,t3_tuh4fq,False,True,t1_i33uust,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tuh4fq/ukraine_megathread_april_2/i342z0y/,1648910851,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648882035.0,

[],False,,ryan-throwaway-2021,,,[],,,,text,t2_9jxd7syr,False,False,"I agree with you. I think people are underestimating the risks. If Russian forces begin to collapse, any hypothetical worries Putin may have about 'breaking taboos' or 'turning the world against Russia' will surely drop away: he may need to escalate just to survive.

In the next few weeks, Russian forces may be heading towards stalemate or defeat, even in eastern Ukraine. Given Putin's commitment to this war, and the sunk costs he has already incurred in launching it, he has very clear incentives to escalate if it becomes the only way to avert a humiliating defeat.  
  
Ukraine appears to mounting highly effective counter-offensives around Kyiv. Those succeses may be partly because Russia is withdrawing some forces from the Kyiv area, perhaps ultimately to reinforce offensives in eastern Ukraine. But there seems to be some uncertainty about whether Russia can still muster the combat power needed to effect large scale territorial gains in the east, especially if units repositioning from Kyiv are intercepted/destroyed en route. (eg. [source](https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1509935078494904340)) Some of the discussion on this subreddit is pessimistic about Russia's chances of additional gains in the east.  
  
Meanwhile, the West is beginning to escalate the kind of military hardware it is providing to Ukraine, with reports of long range artillery and armoured vehicles being sent, in addition to continuing deliveries of drones, rockets and missiles. Ukraine will pressure the West to escalate hardware support to the level needed to inflict total defeat on Russian forces. If Ukraine is able to push the Russians back even in the east, I think we are into a very dangerous moment: Putin has no way of saving face without escalation.

I simply cannot imagine Putin accepting total defeat and withdrawal. Particularly when this is a defeat inflicted on him by a leader he resents, armed by NATO powers. He is a murderer with no concern for massive civilian casualties, a risk-tolerant gambler whose strongman persona cannot tolerate defeat or humiliation. He will surely not allow himself to go down in history as the man who lost Crimea, who lost Ukraine, who launched one of the greatest military defeats in his nation's history. If military defeat seems likely, his life, his regime, and his legacy are in extreme jeopardy: this is the highest cost possible for him, so every alternative is preferable. I think he would almost certainly prefer to escalate (eg general mobilisation and potentially the use of tactical nuclear weapons) to stave off a total defeat of Russian forces.  
  
So I fear for the endgame. I want Ukraine to win - but I fear Putin losing. It is very difficult to imagine Putin facing a total Ukrainian victory without escalating to avoid it. His risk appetite will increase if Russia's position becomes desperate. That crunch point could materialise in the coming weeks and months.

There is this thing at school when one of the pupils misbehave, he gets sent to the corner by the teacher. This is a crude, but effective tactic that maintains harmony in the classroom since:

a) the troublemaker gets removed from stage
b) other pupils witness what happens when one fails to play by the rules.

Now if the bully/offender pupil wants to hang around and fraternize with other bullies at recess and complain at how life is not fair, he is more than entitled to do as he wishes. But once the recess over bell rings, he gets sent back to the corner of the classroom up and until he decides to change its manners and learn to interact with its classmates in a meaningful and respectuous matter.

Obviously, our international relations system has plenty of ways where it could improve and even be fairer. But ever since the end of the last butchery colloquially referred as WWII, I believe it has made a quite decent effort at maintaining a peaceful status-quo where nations can solve their differences resorting to the rule of Law rather than violence.

As such, this allegory pretty much stands.

When the collective colloquially named as ""Russia"" learns to behave itself, then they will get taken out of the corner.

There's a difference between ""this is my historical backyard"" and ""this is historically my country."" Russian biases towards Ukraine are largely based in thinking they're not a real country - a bias that led them to believe - irrationally - that Ukraine would simply fall.

&gt;Russia has a very limited border with NATO. Russian borders Estonia at 294 km and Latvia at 214 km. Ukraine on the other hand has 2063 km of sea and land border with Russia. Like sure, NATO is bordered with Russia but it is essentially chocked off to one theater. With Ukraine it's a multi theater front.


Yes, but sharing any border already means the whole ""missiles on the border"" concern is already a reality.

&gt;As for how bad it would be for Russia, no great power will accept a fundamental shift on their security for 2000 kms, like it could be a border guarded by kittens and any great power would rather move in than not move in.

I already said it's not a good outcome for Russia, I'm just saying they're overstating it by claiming it's existential. My argument is the relative loss does not justify the invasion - Russia was successfully keeping Ukraine out of NATO by other means, despite Ukrainian ambitions. It does not appear that this invasion was the only way to prevent Ukraine in NATO. 

&gt;And then, you keep talking about the consequences, the outcome on this means Russia fucked up, and I would agree, but it doesn't mean they were irrational. You have to seperate a plan with carrying out the plan. We are talking whether or not it is an rational act done in self interest. Just because you fucked up in you planning and really fuck yourself doesn't mean it is irrational. It is irrational for Putin to try the same thing if he failed before, for example, suppose he failed Crimea 2014 then yeah it would be irrational, it is irrational to try the same shit if it failed before. But he didn't. Him pulling the same kind of play book is about his creativity, not his irrationality.

Even before the invasion, it was obvious this would be some kind of failure - at the very least, a 20 year insurgency bleeding Russia dry. No one expected it to fail outright, but most expected it to fail eventually.

The plan was a bad one even if it had gone as intended - a country of 40 million that is hardened against you from 8 years of conflict is not going to just roll over if you occupy. The underlying assumptions of Russian strategic thinking appear to have been heavily biased by anti-Ukrainian sentiment (and perhaps buying a bit too much into their own propaganda).

So, if option A is to invade, and option B is to prevent NATO expansion by other, more limited means, they seem to have chosen the wrong option, largely as a result of faulty, biased assumptions (aka irrationality). 

It'd be one thing if they made that mistake purely on bad intel or plain incompetence, but it seems as though fundamental biases played a large role in Russia overstepping here, when a more limited course of action was more in their self-interest.

But Russia is also in some sense institutionally biased toward being a pretty shitty neighbor, which is also likely not in their best interest.",ff3d7c994bb2b98d7d092c0cf9738bfcf4af8fc0,True,False,,,,,0,1648902083,,0,{},i33mopv,False,t3_ttcbnd,False,True,t1_i336dvs,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ttcbnd/john_mearsheimer_on_why_the_west_is_principally/i33mopv/,1648902099,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648873283.0,

As a tactical matter the capacity of heavy artillery to control a space is limited by modern high rises and large factories. Tooze links to some gruesome accounts from Grozny and the Yugoslavian civil war where urban warfare was central, as well as links to public documents of how US military tried to learn from this as they in the early 21st century developed tactics for MOUT. The scale of Ukrainian urban war is illustrated by Tooze with the facts that Stalingrad in WWII was close to half a million inhabitants, and a place where enormous military resources were deployed, and Mariupol is 400k today, Kyiv almost 3 millions.

Russia violates NATO airspace daily, but NATO refuses to even fly their RC-135's across the Ukrainian border for a better peak at Russian forces, even though such a move is not illegal. 

* The whole shitshow around the MiG-29's, and the US literally ""mansplaining"" the Ukrainian war to the Ukrainians

* [Continued refusal to admit Ukraine into NATO, even in the scenario of a Ukrainian victory](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ukraine-nato-membership-zelensky-russia-putin-b2039085.html)

It seems disrespectful to just say you are wrong, but it's also tiring to have to explain all the issue so why don't we settle on just a few things in detail and I'll list out the things that are wrong.

So here is the list.

It is not irrational to base your decision making on historical precedents. It is not irrational to make decisions base on ideology. It's probably a bad idea to base things on biases, but let's face it no one is saint.

It is uncertain Russia would lose a conventional war prior to Feb. The Soviet legend got everyone going I guess up till Feb, though people may have though Russia is like 14 ft tall then, somehow and understandably people thinks Russia is like 4 ft tall. In either case, prior to the event, it is not irrational for Russia to think it could take on an conventional fight.

Russia has a very limited border with NATO. Russian borders Estonia at 294 km and Latvia at 214 km. Ukraine on the other hand has 2063 km of sea and land border with Russia. Like sure, NATO is bordered with Russia but it is essentially chocked off to one theater. With Ukraine it's a multi theater front.

As for how bad it would be for Russia, no great power will accept a fundamental shift on their security for 2000 kms, like it could be a border guarded by kittens and any great power would rather move in than not move in. 

And then, you keep talking about the consequences, the outcome on this means Russia fucked up, and I would agree, but it doesn't mean they were irrational. You have to seperate a plan with carrying out the plan. We are talking whether or not it is an rational act done in self interest. Just because you fucked up in you planning and really fuck yourself doesn't mean it is irrational. It is irrational for Putin to try the same thing if he failed before, for example, suppose he failed Crimea 2014 then yeah it would be irrational, it is irrational to try the same shit if it failed before. But he didn't. Him pulling the same kind of play book is about his creativity, not his irrationality.",5edd12350ece8d5c1c9a5fd191acdcb2740b017c,True,False,,,,,0,1648888955,,0,{},i336dvs,False,t3_ttcbnd,False,True,t1_i32cdlf,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ttcbnd/john_mearsheimer_on_why_the_west_is_principally/i336dvs/,1648888966,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648860155.0,

Taken in 1984, this photo op was supposed to be a normal propaganda photo op for the PLA until a group of Vietnamese Dac Cong launched a raid against their firebase, forcing the Chinese to beat back Vietnamese assault with flamethrower, fougasse, claymore, and hand to hand combat.

After the war of 1979, both sides moved to a more static war of attrition, something China was more than happy to tolerate. Beijing had learned that they had time as their ally: as long as the threat of a Chinese invasion was real, the Vietnamese would have to mobilize massive amount of resources to defend their Northern border. This would take a massive toll on Vietnam's economy, and sooner or later Vietnam would be broken into submission.

They were right.

By 1984, Vietnam was beyond exhausted, if not on death's door. Isolated, broken, destitute, its only hope was in the sheer tenacity of its people, something that was also running out as an astonishing rate. It was the time to strike

We never knew what happened on that fateful day in 1984 because to this day there is still no consensus on who opened fire first. Unsurprisingly, the Chinese blamed the Vietnamese, the Vietnamese the Chinese. We only knew for sure that on the 2nd of April 1984, the Vietnamese around the Hà Giang area would come under the most intense artillery bombard every known to man. For 20 days straight, Chinese guns bombard Vietnamese force 24/7, with some online Chinese source claiming they used up to 10,000 shells per day and the Kumming military region ran dry of artillery shell. It was so intense, Vietnamese troops said the mountain they were on was cut down into dust and many Vietnamese troops were simply vaporized into dust as even the remnants of their bodies were torn apart. This led to the hills of Hà Giang being called ""Lò vôi thế kỷ"", ""the lime kiln of the century"", because everything was grounded to a choking white dust.

Then came a massive attack, launched by at least 3 Chinese divisions against 8 Vietnamese-held hill. The attack broke the Vietnamese. The 313th division was routed off height 1509, but not before giving the Chinese a bloody nose in which some Chinese units reported 20% fatality rate. However, Vietnamese artilleries were silent, being bombarded by Chinese artillerists who were given aid from the newly-established Chinese special force (created to deal with Vietnam specifically) conducting long range patrol deep into Vietnamese territory and Britain-supplied Cymbeline artillery-locating radar.

For the next few months, the battle devolved into a series of artillery strikes, mass human waves attack by Vietnamese force to reclaim the height, long range raids by both sides to destroy important installation, cut off supply line, and assassinate VIP. The battle was extremely fierce: during the battle for hill 65 on the Lô river (called Songmaoling in China), the Chinese fired 10,000 artillery round in two hours, and 30,000 rounds in one day, sometimes as close as 50 meters to their own line to stop the Vietnamese. Vietnamese troops launched suicidal attack up the hill, suffering horrendous rate. Chinese veterans recalled how the battlefield was so packed with Vietnamese corpses one could hardly step on the ground without stepping on a dead Vietnamese. Even Vietnamese sources, often averse to talking about casualties, have to admit their tremendous casualties. The Vietnamese commanding general even said ""If you [commanding officers] keep on fighting like this, Vietnamese mothers cannot give birth to enough kids to replenish our ranks."" The Vietnamese lived in horrendous condition, swarmed with flies, plagued with diseases, and suffered tremendously from malnutrition. Despite that, they often achieved victories, but these were short lived as they were soon pushed down from the height. In fact, in some region, the Chinese deliberately withdrew from a height to bait the Vietnamese into occupying it, then plastering the Vietnamese with their superior artillery.

Both sides fought to a bitter end, either out of patriotism or a sheer madness driven by the desire to take his opponents down. When hill 1509 fell, four female Vietnamese medics volunteered to stay behind as rear guard since their hospital was placed at the most advantageous location to stop the Chinese. Took the Chinese a whole day and copious amount of flamethrower to burn the four alive. When the Vietnamese launched counterattack in Songmaoling and overran it, one Chinese radio operator stayed behind to call artillery strike onto Vietnamese who were overrunning him, killing himself in the process. The Vietnamese forced dug their ways with nothing but hands and shovels through the mountain to creep up close to the Chinese - a tactic that they had used against the French at Dien Bien Phu and American at Khe Sanh; the Chinese dragged fifty-ton tanks up steep mountain slope with nothing but sheer human strength and some cows. The best and worst of humanity were all on display on those mountains as young men gave their lives for a distant cause, only to have their stories forgotten and relegated to an unimportant footnote of history.

After months of fighting, the 1984 border war died not with a bang but with a whimper, the result of which remains unclear to this day. We do not know how many men died on those slopes, nor do we know who won at the end. Again, the Vietnamese claimed they win, and so did the Chinese. There were often ""CIA sources"" thrown around that said the Chinese won and the Vietnamese failed to retake the hills, and seeing that I have not found any maps or proofs of the periods to see who controlled what I will not pass my judgement.

In the end, we could say this for sure: the 1984 war weakened Vietnam even more, forcing them to seek a way to disengage from Cambodia and a way to normalize the relation with China. This would pave the way for the controversial secret treaty of Chengdu, signed in 1990 to normalize Sino-Vietnamese relations.

But not before both sides waging two smaller conflicts.

But that is a story for another day.

----------------------------

TLDR: China forced Vietnam into WW1-style attrition warfare and grind them down with their manpower, and later their massive artillery advantage. Turns out fortifications don't matter quite as much when you have enough artillery firepower to remove entire hills or the entire sides of mountains.

Vietnam couldn't use their famed guerilla warfare tactics because much of their industry was concentrated in the very northern part of their country, right in the path of China's advance. And unlike Ukraine or Afghanistan (in the Soviet-Afghan War where everyone who had an axe to grind against the USSR were backing the mujaheddin, including China), they were internationally isolated and left almost entirely alone to fight China. The fact that China got counter-battery radar systems delivered by the US while Vietnam had none of the new toys just drives home how isolated Vietnam was.

As for that particular counter-battery radar system: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cymbeline_(radar)

&gt; Cymbeline could locate a mortar with an accuracy of 50 metres. 81 mm mortars could be located at up to 10 km and larger mortars to 20 km. Secondary roles were area and coastal surveillance, helicopter and light aircraft control, meteor balloon tracking and rapid survey. It could also observe and adjust ground and airburst artillery fire and high angle fire. 

...

&gt; Four sets went to China, via the US, in 1979. Two may have been retained for study by Chinese radio engineers. The others were used in the border conflicts between China and Vietnam, with great effectiveness.[10] These were such a disruption to the Vietnamese that in 1984 a special forces operation at the battle of Lao mountain was organised to destroy one of them.[11] China eventually produced a reverse engineered version designated as Type 371.[10]",04864099019758fec274542f55994c04ac067871,True,False,,,,,0,1648884855,,0,{},i331r37,False,t3_tu106x,False,True,t1_i331m3q,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tu106x/the_intellectual_failures_behind_russias_bungled/i331r37/,1648884871,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648856055.0,

Of all the Indochina war, the Sino-Vietnamese war was the most misunderstood and underreported.

It was also Vietnam's closest brush to a total collapse.

By 1979, Vietnam had a nickname: ""The Asian Prussia."" It had one of the largest and most sophisticated army in the world, not least Southeast Asia, and was perhaps the most battle hardened as seen in 30 years of constant combat since 1945 to 1975.

However, it was being too arrogant for its all good.

High on its victory, Vietnamese leader began to isolate themselves. They refused offers to normalize relationships with the United States, got on Moscow's ire for supporting the Khmer Rouge before 1975 and for unifying both Vietnam. Southeast Asian neighbors, Thailand and to a lesser extent Singapore, were afraid of Vietnam as Vietnam had publicly violated the guaranteed neutrality of Lao and Cambodia by supporting communist group such as the Pathet Lao in Lao and the Khmer Issarak (later the Cambodian Communist Party or Khmer Rouge) in Cambodia.

But out of all the force they could piss off, they pissed of China the most. Beijing had been the largest supporter of the Viet Minh and had helped the Viet Minh in the darkest hour of 1947-1949 when Viet Minh was pushed off the Red river Delta. It had supported Hanoi for close to 25 years in hope that this would somehow attract Vietnam into its sphere of influence. So, when Vietnam humiliated Beijing, first in 1954 when Vietnam disregarded the neutrality of Cambodia and Lao which had been negotiated by Zhou Enlai of China with the British and French at Geneva, and later in 1975 when Vietnam invaded South Vietnam, directly disregarding the 1973 Paris peace treaty which both China and Soviet Union worked on, China was pissed. Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia in 1977, the mass expulsion of Vietnamese people of Chinese descent after 1975, the Vietnamese-Soviet mutual defense treaty of 1978, China's internal politics, the rise of Deng Xiaoping, and tacit greenlight from the US led to war.

In 1979, war broke out in the most nightmarish battlespace imaginable ever known to men. Some 200,000 Chinese troops of the Guangzhou military region (Hanoi claimed 600,000 to this day, a number not supported by any other sources) attacked in three prongs into Vietnam. In some places they had to cross massive, sweeping river; climbed up mountains 1,000 to 2,000 meters high and as steep as 60 degrees; fought against dug in determined Vietnamese force with 100,000 main frontline troops and 150,000 militia. Despite China being the bigger country, their army was weaker: they were numerous but poorly trained, poorly armed, poorly led, a result of numerous purge during the Mao's era. The Vietnamese were highly trained, highly motivated, and experienced. They also held some of the toughest defensive positions known on earth, a Maginot line on the mountain, built and continuously reinforced by the Qing, French, and North Vietnamese for some 70 plus years.

And the Chinese broke through.

They broke through some defense in just a few days. Đồng Đăng, the strongest fortress guarding Lạng Sơn, fell in 8 days. Lai Châu and Hà Giang fell in quick succession. The Vietnamese and Chinese battered each other bloody at Móng Cái as the Chinese were sometimes closed to secure Quảng Ninh, one of the two major ports of North Vietnam.

The war of 1979 was a failure of epic proportion on the Vietnamese side, despite what internet pop history would have you believe. The PAVN, with access to the best weapons system the Soviet Union had to offer and vast quantities of captured American weapons were dislodged from some of the best defensible position any military officers could ask for. The Chinese fought their way out of the mountain, down into the plains, through narrow mountain passes that would be the same nightmare the Soviet faced just a years later in Afghanistan, through dense jungle the American faced only seven years ago in South Vietnam. They emerged into major towns and cities where both sides fought with no quarter asked or given.

Cao Bằng was the largest, seeing 28 days of constant combat. Vietnamese and Chinese fought through cellars and rooftops, mouseholing walls and bayonetting each others. Flamethrowers were used en masse as Chinese sappers would line up and open up on Vietnamese positions, overwhelmed them with a sea of flame. Vietnamese troops would run live wire in water to electrocute advancing Chinese. Both sides disassembled tanks and sent them up the mountain slopes where Chinese and Vietnamese tanks engaged in running battle across the jungles and up the mountain.

The war ended in 28 days, a war more brutal than any war Vietnam had ever faced. Some half a million men fought up those mountains, anywhere from 25% to 36% of them would be made casualties. To give you an idea of how brutal this battle was: at the low estimate, the daily casualties rate per day was twice that seen in Verdun, at the high estimate, it was equal that to the Somme. Both Verdun and Somme involved force at least three time bigger than in 1979. In addition to that, 100,000 Vietnamese civilians were massacred by retreating Chinese.

Who won ? The answer was simple:

China.

I may be a Vietnamese, and my fellow Viets will skin me alive for saying this, but the truth is the truth.

China came to the war looking to punish Vietnam for invading Cambodia. But it was not the only goal.

First, it wanted to prove to the US how dedicated it was to Washington's anti-Soviet, anti-communist agenda. It achieved that.

Secondly, it wanted to prove to the Southeast Asian nations that China would protect them from the Asian Prussia. It did just that.

Third, it increased Vietnamese international isolation. Again, it did: throughout the whole war, you would see that I made no mention of the Soviet Union. That was because the Soviet Union, despite signing the treaty with Vietnam, did not act. They made no attempts to supply Vietnam with equipment or create pressure on China except diplomatic pressure, and only offered some symbolic assistance by airlifting troops from Cambodia North.

Fourth, Deng wanted to use the war to push through reform and purge his enemy inside the PLA. The poor performance of the PLA troop gave him his pretext.

Fifth, Deng wanted to weaken Vietnam in the long run. That, he managed too. Many Northern cities were destroyed, some like Cao Bằng and Lạng Sơn destroyed to 80%. Many North Vietnamese units were heavily damaged like the 337th, the 345th, the 3rd, the 316th, and the 346th. More had to be siphoned off from Cambodia and Laos and Vietnam would have to maintain a very strong force in the North. This not only caused major hemorrhage to the Vietnamese army who was waging war on 3 fronts, it decimated the economy as now a vast percentage of the male population were serving in wars. The fact that the Soviet Union began to cut support for Vietnam due to economic crisis back home and the war in Afghanistan hurt Vietnam ever further. But the worst problem was the boat people: some 1.6 million people, or 3% of the total Vietnamese population, fled the country, many because they were scared of the prospect of war.

Vietnam was barely able to stop the Chinese. To this day, there was a major debate whether the Vietnamese had defeated the Chinese or the Chinese simply saw no points in advancing any further and withdrew. As a Vietnamese, I inclined to say that at the very least Vietnam defeated the Chinese incursion.

But the war bled it dry. And this had dire consequence.

On one hand, Vietnam did not muster enough force to completely quell the Khmer Rouge and other anti-Vietnam force in Cambodia, leading to a protracted and indecisive war that lasted to 1989. On the other hand, its Northern army became stagnated, unable to modernize while the Chinese learned their lesson and reformed their army.

When the PLA came back in 1984, they came back with a vengeance.

As for air superiority, the only airstrike that the Communist side ever launched on the South in the entire war came on the day that Saigon fell, launched using captured A-37s launched from Da Nang. 

As Merle Pribbenow explains in his article about the endgame in Vietnam, the NVA launched its attack using captured artillery rounds from lavishly equipped ARVN firebases.

It is an interesting look at the non officer side of the Russian military and in their organization and pay structure which is different than what is common elsewhere. 

As I watch the roll call of the Russian dead on Rob Lee's twitter feed it does stick out to me the amount of losses that are officers. With a military structure so dependent on the few officers it does offer some clues to the direction less nature of the isolated units, and the strange tactical decisions that are made on the small scale.

Quote from the Article:

&gt; Russia does not want well-rounded enlisted leaders, they want narrowly-focused, technically competent, professional, enlisted soldiers. Due to this very different system, Russian contract servicemen are probably more accurately described as ""enlisted professionals"" than “noncommissioned officers.”

As much as Russia likes to say Ukraine in NATO is an existential threat, it really isn't. Russia already borders NATO countries, Russia would lose a conventional war with NATO regardless of Ukraine, and NATO will never invade Russia with nuclear weapons at play. So, from a rational strategic perspective, Ukraine in NATO doesn't really fundamentally change the game. Why then is it framed as existential by Russia? A ton of history, ideology, biases - in other words, irrationality.

That's not to say that Ukraine looking Westward is *good* for Russia, but rather that Russia seems to overstate how bad it would be.

On the flip side, now Russia is dealing with some pretty serious long term issues that will absolutely have a severe effect on its security, and hard and soft power projection. Its military industrial complex is not self sufficient and its economy is going to suffer immensely, both of which will dramatically limit Russia's ability to maintain a modern army (much less reform it). They've severely weakened their military and diplomatic credibility. They've galvanized NATO, and might even end up with more NATO countries in its backyard.

This is all in within the context of a Russian economy that was already weak and overly reliant on extraction. China will not be able to fill the gaps.

So, I've outlined that Ukraine in NATO is probably not as dire as Russia claimed, and the current situation is. That doesn't mean the rational action is to simply cede Ukraine - on the contrary, the rational move absolutely would be to extert diplomatic and irregular military pressure to prevent that from happening. Which they could do, and were doing successfully.

I would argue that the United States lost the Vietnam and Afghanistan Wars in every contemporary understanding, the Soviets lost their Afghanistan war, and the Russians are losing this war.

You could argue the US lost Vietnam politically. I have explain this already. So I am just gonna copy paste it unless you can actually add something new. 

""The loss is a political loss, ie, the US fail to accomplish her political goal. Now if we are saying Russia would lose in that fashion, then I think no nuclear weapons will be used. Russia is basically conceding on the political point of 1) regime change and 2) military disarmnment.""


&gt;It is really an open question whether Putin CAN do this or is ABLE to do this. ""Russian artillery"" is not a magic wand; it has not been able to inflict really significant military defeats on Ukraine so far. Russian artillery has been blasting Mariupol for weeks and somehow that city is still alive. Artillery alone is not enough to win a battle or a war.

Pal, unless you got some serious juice with top secret shit, the only thing we can talk about is 'can'. Because we don't know the actual things happening and the things that potentially could happen. We are going off on the fog of war knowing both sides are throwing up crazy amount of smoke and operate on the 'can'. 

Russian artillery is wrecking plenty of Ukrainian cities. There isn't significant military defeat because the Ukrainians aren't offering battle, they are sitting in cities. And seeing how Russian are sieging them, we will find out about whether or not these will be military defeats or not. Mariupol is alive insofar as a walking skeleton is alive. Also, to assume that when I say use artillery I meant it as only use artillery is a pretty dumb thing to interpret my comments. Artillery needs covering needs spotting needs transportations. 

&gt;He might. Or it might not be politically feasible for him to. In which case that is a military defeat. If you play the game on the board, and you lose, and you decide not to up the ante and do something crazy and stupid to win a lost war...it's still a lost war.

See, that's we disagree. You think players has to play the board. I think when yo ugot nukes you get to flip the board and say fuck it. 

&gt;These are a lot of assumptions. ""We would see"" is not necessarily the case, since the media landscape is by no means 100% complete and not every bit of this war is captured on camera. What we do know is that A.) Russia has abandoned most of its gains NW and NE of Kyiv, B.) they suffered at least some losses in the process, and C.) if they could have held these areas they would. This was not a step-by-step withdrawal, this was a sudden retreat from ground they sacrificed many men to take. I would not call that orderly.

In a military conflict that is an attritional war, whether you move forward, backward, or stationary, you will suffer losses. When you say it is an unorganized retreat, what do you think that even means if it's just 'some losses'? 

So for your A), no shit, it's a fucking retreat. B), it's attritional in nature. Of course you will suffer losses. C) no, it's a fucking retreat, not a halt in offense, not a stall, it's a fucking retreat. They aren't holding these areas because strategically they are retreating. Are we changing the definition of words now?

Except for Stalin's times, Soviet Union was mostly ruled by the Party and the Politburo, it wasn't just a personal dictatorship.

Putin is just a classic dictator. It's hard to name anyone else who matters in Russia other than regional bosses like Kadyrov who have no power outside their regions, and are kept in line as Putin decides how much money each region gets. His ""party"" is so meaningless, he's not even a part of it.

&gt; Similarly, you can all but guarantee that if Russian standards of living collapse, tens of thousands return home wounded (or not at all), and Russia gets nothing out of it

In the 90s, despite multiple economic collapses and much worse loss in the First Chechen War (against tiny and unsupported Chechnya; now at least he can pretend they lost to NATO), nothing really threatened government anyway. Yeltsin hand-picked Putin as his successor, and that was it.

&gt; This is, frankly, more lazy analysis that relies on Russians being subjugated dumb pawns of the Kremlin

I think that's actually fairly accurate. There's no civil society in Russia, no democratic traditions. I can totally believe that Putin might fall and get replaced, but that would only result in another dictator or semi-dictator taking his place.

1. They could double, or triple their manpower in Ukraine without drastic measures - by calling upon volunteers, as well as mobilising reservists for internal deployment that would free regular troops currently garrisoned throughout Russia.
2. The support for the war is growing quickly (the latest independent polls are showing **81%**) but this needs to be solidified into a degree of national will that can take long-term heavy casualties. The easiest way to do that is to focus on the *fighting the West* narrative. Convince the people that Russia is not fighting Ukraine - it is fighting the entire West, through its massive arms shipments, intelligence support and dozens of thousands of volunteers. Rebroadcasting videos coming from ""American battalions"" and other volunteer units would here be particularly useful.
3. Attack the so far untouched critical Ukrainian infrastructure, particularly the **road, railway and electricity network**, would severely hamper its warfighting capability. Without electricity, the mobile networks would struggle and even drone charging would become more difficult.
4. Have realistic goals - what was stated before the war still looks achievable - the separation of Donetsk, Lugansk and Crimea; neutralisation and demilitarisation. Actually, Russia even now controls far more land than it demands. Don't fall into the PR trap of where Western analysts claim that you wanted to seize the whole Ukraine in 36 hours - so everything less than that impossible goal become a defeat.
