[],False,,throwdemawaaay,,,[],,,,text,t2_xzr44,False,False,"I'm not familiar with any use of MSRI in WW2. Time on Target was invented by the British, but that was about coordinating multiple batteries for barrage at the same pre arranged second, not about individual guns using multiple trajectories for simultaneous impact. Similar in concept, but not the same.

That said, a skilled artillery officer could have done MSRI. There are abbreviated versions of artillery calculations that allow you to make small adjustments based on a previous firing solution, rather than computing a whole new solution. Someone good enough with the pen and paper math could definitely do it, so the only other question is if the gun crews could hit the firing rate needed. Perhaps it was a thing and I'm just not familiar.

The US approach to artillery calculations in WW2 is really interesting. It hinged on two things:

1. Good maps of the entire theater of operations, widely copied and distributed
2. Precomputed tables for firing solutions

The fist was a huge advantage, because it meant anyone with basic orienteering skills and a radio could call in artillery strikes with precise coordinates, everyone working from a common reference frame.

The second was quite literally filing cabinets full of tables, such that instead of needing to do substantial pen and paper computations, they just looked up the answer given the relevant parameters.

A big advantage of this system is that it could immediately fire for effect mere minutes after a call, occasionally seconds, with accuracy, and without any initial shots and adjustment to refine the firing solution.",c1e592f6b5cd2fb12f3bc7ebece920c636f67dcd,True,False,,,,,0,1651881346,,0,{},i7m914s,False,t3_ujlv6d,False,True,t1_i7k6bfp,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ujlv6d/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_06_2022/i7m914s/,1651881359,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651852546.0,

I don't think much of it is ready to drive off right now.... but there is an awful lot of Ex-Soviet kit in storage, and if the timeline is ""a year"" to get equipped I don't doubt they could get a fair chunk of it running even if they have to cannabalise much of the rest of it to get parts.

Take tanks. They have (in theory) 10,000 in storage. Most of those are absolute junk, but not all of them. A recent ""sattelite survey"" by a YouTube account estimated that 3,500 were ""potentially salvagable"".

Even if they only got half of those working over a year, by salvaging parts from the other half of ""salvagables"" and ""the junkers"" and perhaps importing some perishable parts like rubber bits and electronics from china..... thats still 1,750 tanks. About 20% more than they started the original invasion with (albeit in general a lot older).

If they mobilised....and *gave themselves a year*.... then they would have a reasonable amount of dated, but working, kit.

The real problem would likely be that whilst they were re-tooling with 1970s/1980s Soviet Kit..... Ukraine could re-tool just as fast with 2000's/2010's surplus US kit..... and they'd get smooshed after the years delay anyway by a 2 gen more advanced army.

Is it?

Over its long, long history, after roughly defining its borders China has much more functioned as a 'police state' than as an 'outward-looking' power.

Due to its ability to maintain a centralized government and build wealth, it was able to wield influence over its neighbors by 'soft power'. Their neighbors paid tribute but there was no need to conquer them, And it was no doubt seen as not worth the effort to absorb and be obliged to try to 'civilize' many of the southeast asian countries seen as violent barbarians.

Inner stability has always been the aim. Expanding outwards was always seen as an invitation to outside influence and thus chaos. A few militaristic invasions failed (Japan). They were the first country with naval technology to go long distances, but when the resources  began to be brought back (like animals from Africa) this campaign was brought to a halt because...again, invitation to chaos.  The power structure chose the status quo.

It was only when China began to collapse in the 1800's and become prey for outside colonialists who had no interest in adapting their  power structure (as Mongolian conquers had done) that China  had  to confront with how to deal with the outside world.

I would add, unlike almost any other major power (maybe ancient greece/rome?)  warriors/soldiers have a relatively low status and not held up as heroes. Scholars were the highest status and most admired people in the culture Even the sometimes lowly military types who lead revolutions leading to empire change, HAD to write a book afterwards to validate themselves as scholars in order to be highly regarded (even Mao had to do this).

Looking at the recent 'pacification' of Hong Kong, this was not done  militarily but by soft power and policing.

All this pointing to history indicating China is very unlikely to become an expansionist military power - it is just not built into the culture. Soft power - yes, using financial influence - yes.  I don't think this is at all difficult to understand and its a little frustrating any well educated people would think it was.",584e94459763bc096ca569a5d9b4587ebcd17e2e,True,False,,,,,0,1651875952,,0,{},i7lxv8d,False,t3_uj9sjw,False,True,t1_i7hl9nd,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uj9sjw/unrestricted_warfare_is_not_chinas_master_plan/i7lxv8d/,1651875967,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651847152.0,

Both objectives were approximately sixty miles from the nearest friendly lines. Commanders sought to significantly shorten the war by seizing critical operational and strategic objectives. Commanders in both cases underestimated the enemy forces waiting below. 

&gt; * The Vozdushno-desantnye voyska Rossii (VDV) is an elite Russian airborne organization, designed to be, as one Russian analyst stated, “light imperial infantry,” responsible for quick reaction within Russia’s near abroad.

&gt; * Except for the vaunted and mysterious Spetsnaz, the 45,000-strong VDV is seen as the most elite element of the Russian military, with its own annual and nationally recognized Paratroopers Day and having a separate branch status on par with the Russian Strategic Missile Forces, responsible for ground-based nuclear missiles, within the Russian Armed Forces.

&gt; * Increasing the VDV’s capabilities was a key priority of the 2008 New Look reforms to the Russian army. 

&gt; * The initial VDV assault into Antonov Airport consisted of approximately a company-sized element of three hundred light infantry soldiers with light antitank and modern assault rifles, supported by Ka-52 and Mi-8 helicopters for fire support and transport, respectively. 

&gt; * …the professional airborne practitioner must also be prepared for the enemy’s reaction. 

&gt; * Conducting a daylight attack enabled Russia to overcome a lack of night-vision equipment and increase coordination but also left Russian forces vulnerable to man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS), resulting in the loss of two Ka-52 and three Mi-8 helicopters. 

&gt; * Russian paratroopers were driven off the airfield and into the surrounding woods by 2200.

&gt; * The aftermath of Market Garden and the many noted deficiencies in intelligence and leadership led to a further nine months of occupation of the Netherlands and an estimated sixteen thousand additional Dutch deaths.

&gt; * The Ukrainians maintained pressure on the Russians in the surrounding area of Hostomel and repeatedly attacked Russian armored columns, blunting any chance of a quick strike emerging from the airfield into Kyiv. At the operational and strategic levels, the VDV’s inability to support a quick strike meant its forces were tied down for weeks until finally being withdrawn in early April.

&gt; * Before intelligence planning and equipment loadouts are to be considered, the mission has to be a sustainable one. Airborne forces are not designed to hold out for extended periods of time. The Market Garden operation was supposed to take forty-eight to ninety-six hours and the Antonov Airport assault ended up taking approximately the same amount of time.

Key Takeaways

The Ukrainian counteroffensive along a broad arc north and east of Kharkiv city took further terrain and will likely push Russian forces out of tube artillery range of the city in the coming days. The ability—and willingness—of the Ukrainian military to concentrate the forces in Kharkiv necessary to conduct this operation indicates Ukrainian confidence in repelling ongoing Russian attacks with their existing forces in the region.

Russian forces did not make any progress on the Izyum axis.

Russian forces likely secured small gains on the outskirts of Severodonetsk in the last 24 hours but are unlikely to successfully surround the town.

Russian forces continued assaults on the Azovstal plant, but ISW cannot confirm any specific advances. Likely widespread civilian resistance to the Russian occupation may additionally be disrupting previously announced Russian plans to conduct a Victory Day exhibition in Mariupol.

There were no significant changes on the southern axis in the last 24 hours and Russian forces continued to reinforce their forward positions.

&gt;Getting closer to the Russian border is rather irrelevant given that they have hundreds of miles of border already in contact with Russia.

Not all border is the same. *This* section of border is the one that provides a rail line from Belgorod, a major supply hub, to the front lines north of the Donbas.

Maybe this will be clearer on a map that shows the rail lines....hang on.... The yellow/green strped line is at the top of this map is the one that goes from Belgorod to Kupyansk, north of Izyium.

[],False,,UltraRunningKid,,,[],,,,text,t2_takjt,False,False,"&gt; What do you mean? What could US intel possible have given them that the soldiers on the ground didn't have? The only thing was the preparation for invasion, but that was hardly hidden.

The New York Times reported that US intel warned Ukraine the invasion had begun before missiles had crossed the border. This allowed Ukraine to move their mobile SAM batteries from their current locations, and subsequently the Pentagon reported many Russian missiles struck empty fields. 

Also, this allowed Ukraine to get planes into the air, prior to them being bombed on the ground as Russia struck the hangers with both cruise missiles and tactical ballistic missiles in the first volley. 

Secondly, this from the NYT:

&gt;At 6:30 a.m. on Feb. 24, the day the war started, Russian missiles slammed into a national guard base near Hostomel airport. A few hours later, Russian helicopters blasted the airport with more missiles that hit the hangars where Mriya and other airplanes were stored, Ukrainian soldiers said. 

Now I'm fairly sure bombing the national guard base was to prevent the reinforcement of the airfield and to prevent the defense of Kyiv by preemptively wiping them out. Having a heads up was probably beneficial. 


NBC reported this:

&gt;That near real-time intelligence-sharing also paved the way for Ukraine to shoot down a Russian transport plane carrying hundreds of troops in the early days of the war, the officials say, helping repel a Russian assault on a key airport near Kyiv.

I think from this it is fairly obvious the US knew two things:

1. The rough plan regarding dropping paratroopers in the west of Kyiv.
2. Close to, if not the exact time the attack was planned. 

I also assume they would have had to wait till the last moment to move their SAM batteries. If Russia saw them all moving before the attack started, it would be fairly obvious the element of surprise was gone. 

One of the issues with landing paratroopers behind enemy lines is the lack of armor support, and with the SAM batteries still active the VDV likely did not have the expected air support, or subsequent flights with armor being flown into the base. 

So I think that even knowing from Social media about the paratroopers was too late.

But if you'd asked me whether, as a civilian, I'd prefer to have my hands tied behind my back and get shot in the head, or abducted to Russia and sexually abused in a prisoner camp, I'd go for option B. I could always kill myself if it got too bad, and end up in the same place.

If the cost is so high and the amount is so trivial at some point having any LNG is irrelevant to the point of not having any at all.

&gt;Yes, for now. Until the EU finds alternatives, which this is enabling.

They've already said there are no alternatives.  Nuclear would be about it provided they're willing to spend insane amounts switching home heating away from gas to electric, but even France is shutting down nuclear facilities, so that is not even an answer.  Green tech is not living up to the hype, so what is the answer?  There are no reasonably cheap and plentiful sources of alternate gas.

&gt;Again, yes, for now. But it is being propped up by Russia. They don't have enough income and reserves to keep that up forever and when that bubble pops it will be severe.

The Ruble is more valuable now than before the war started.  See the exchange rate vs. the dollar, it only has gotten better after the initial panic.  Since everyone is now willing to submit to the Russian demands for Euros for Rubles via Gazprom bank nothing is going to change in terms of the value except it strengthening.  They can keep it up as long as people are willing to keep paying gazprom bank.

&gt;Yes, that is without a doubt, but so is Russia. Russia's economy will take a generation to recover, if it ever does.

Where is the Russian economy collapsing?  

https://thehill.com/opinion/international/3473500-why-sanctions-against-russia-may-not-work/

All the pain is in the west at this point, Russia is not facing inflation or shortages.

&gt;You think they're spending billions to lease these LNG terminals just to quiet critics? Thats certainly an interesting take...

Billions for a multi-trillion dollar economy is a drop in the bucket.

&gt;I'm sure they do, but they have no physical ability to do it. India could easily buy up all that extra gas, but there's no pipeline to india and most of the LNG ships are owned by European countries and will be either barred from shipping Russian gas or will just be busy shipping gas to European countries. Like I said before, there aren't that many LNG ships out there. India and no other country will be able to replace even 10% of Russia's gas exports to Europe.

Energy exports to China are up 60% as are exports to the global south.  Due to the rise in prices globally even if they aren't exporting the same amounts the higher price is offsetting the volume loss.

Beyond the factors you mentioned:

Most soldiers didn't know they were going into **an active invasion** until hour 0

For some reason, the forces advancing on the capital of a hostile state put rosgvardiya, basically the military police, on point.  Like yes, they expected no resistance, but how is that an excuse?

There never materialized a justification for the costly landing at Hostomel.  Presumably their original purpose was the usual Russian strat of securing the airport and flying more troops in, but that never happened.  Either because their SEAD failed or because they just elected not to for some other mysterious reason.

We have been judging it based on it's failure rather than the potential for success and the relatively low forces initially committed. I disagree about about the rest though:

1. After 2-3 days when it became obvious that the attack on Kyiv wasn't going to succeed in the immediate future, they seemed to have no logical follow-up plan in place.  They could have rapidly switched to a more robust backup plan and achieved something.

2. The encirclement of major cities with such low manpower was a bad idea given the forces deployed.  It was never going to succeed and shelling a bunch of cities was never going to help them conquer and control the country.  All it did was open them up to counter attacks and massive attrition. It neither succeeded in it's aims, or execution, in my opinion.

3. The third plan, an encirclement of the Donbass to eliminate a large portion of Ukraine's army, at least had a hope of succeeding and would help work towards a resolution of the conflict.  I think it was about 60 days too late and too understrength to achieve it's objectives. If Russia had deployed more forces in the east instead of Sumy, Kyiv, Kharkiv, etc.. and it has started much earlier with more equipment, I think there was a real chance for success.

[],False,,imagirlbtdubs,,,[],,,,text,t2_l2ded,False,False,"A lot of you have been discussing the Americans' decision (or lack thereof) to reveal that they're sharing intel with Ukraine. This is from [Politico's Natsec Daily Newsletter](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2022/05/06/its-stupid-its-unnecessary-00030762), which came out a few minutes ago:


&gt;Yesterday, the talk of the town was breaking news of the U.S. providing intelligence to Ukraine to kill Russian generals. Now there’s another firestorm over reports on American-provided information helping Ukraine to sink Russia’s Moskva warship last month.

Speculation abounded across the Washington, D.C., natsec and intel communities that the administration was intentionally rubbing salt in the Kremlin’s wound. Turns out none of this is a coordinated leak by President JOE BIDEN’s team: “Someone is eager to take credit, but it’s not helpful,” a U.S. official told NatSec Daily. Others we spoke to revealed there’s an internal freakout over the stream of stories, though it’s unclear exactly who is feeding reporters the juicy nuggets.

Instead of boasting, a parade of administration officials have denied the direct link between the shared intelligence and targets, saying that U.S. military and intel assets merely tell Kyiv where the Russians are generally headed and where the next offensive might take place. What Ukrainian forces do with that information is up to them.

The intelligence the U.S. provides can get specific but not in every instance, multiple Western officials say. Ukrainian forces still have a lot to do after, for example, receiving information about a ping off a cell tower before finding the Russian invaders.

So to paraphrase the administration’s stance: We point the Ukrainians in the direction of Russians to kill, but we don’t provide intelligence with the express purpose of killing specific Russians.

That’s why Biden aides have pushed back so forcefully on the growing narrative.

“Leaks like this and stories like this, they’re unhelpful to the effort to help Ukraine defend itself,” Pentagon spokesperson JOHN KIRBY told CNN this morning. “The intelligence that we provide to Ukraine is legal, it’s lawful, it’s legitimate, and it’s limited. And we’re very careful about what we share and when we share it.”

U.S. officials aren’t the only ones angry about the stories.

“It’s stupid, it’s unnecessary. There’s no upside, only downside,” a European official told us. “It looks like the Americans are trying to take credit for what the Ukrainians are doing.”

“We prefer if these issues are handled privately,” a second European official added. “These kinds of leaks are not helpful” to the allied effort to help Ukraine if they’re not coordinated among all of the parties taking part.

There’s also concern on both sides of the Atlantic that Russian President VLADIMIR PUTIN can’t ignore what news reports now describe as an open proxy war. With “Victory Day” coming up on May 9, Ukrainian officials are assessing that the Kremlin will announce an escalation of the war — that such American involvement can’t stand unanswered.

The second official did add that they don’t expect any new specific provocations coming from Russia as a result of the stories. Russian artillery is already smashing civilian infrastructure across Ukraine the international community beginning to investigate allegations of war crimes.

But there could be a silver lining from all of this: The West always “needs to speak to Russia from a position of power — it’s the language they use and understand — or they will use your weakness against you,” the official asserted.",a8901b53ce9c5773c378331d21d2553eb3be8d6b,True,False,,,,,0,1651869794,,0,{},i7lkmeh,False,t3_ujlv6d,False,True,t3_ujlv6d,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ujlv6d/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_06_2022/i7lkmeh/,1651869811,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651840994.0,

At a certain point cost and lack of quantity means effectively having the same as no gas at all.  

&gt;Part of it could just be pressure on Putin. As we've been seeing the last week or so, Germany is getting more and more serious about supporting Ukraine and finding alternatives to Russian energy. If even just the threat of replacing 1/4 or 1/3 of Russia's gas with other gas could make Putin wrap up the war sooner, that would make this a good move.

How is it putting pressure on Putin?  Prices have gone up to the point that the Russians are making more exporting less energy than they were before this all started.  The ruble is stronger now than before the war.  Meanwhile the Euros are facing recession if not depression from this stunt while their industries have said they cannot function without Russia energy.  

Germany is just making noise to calm the rest of the EU and their own noisy critics at home.  At this point if Europe cuts off its nose to spite its face they would suffer vastly more than the Russians and drag the US down with it.  The Russians have many more willing customers and the more the prices rise due to transportation costs and lack of supply the less the Russians have to export to make the same amount of income off of their energy.  At this point it is a total self-own for the Europeans to the point even Janet Yellen is begging them not to do this.

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"It's been dry enough to off-road in areas since the war began and more especially in the last few weeks. But just not reliably dry enough everywhere to guarantee it. But that's getting better daily, since about last week rains curtailed and temps have gone up.

The way offensives work, especially for Russians, is that a unit's axis of advance is most often chosen by senior HQs usually just looking at a map without knowing much about the actual situation. So a brigade/regt opord calls for x company from y battalion to drive through z field but chances are nobody involved in planning or tasked to execute the plan knows if that area is drivable until they try it. If they aren't pressured by strict time hacks or worrying about element of surprise they can perform a slow and cautious approach doing proper route recon to test their routes, even find areas they can move through to bypass the bad areas (similar to moving through an expected mine field). But if they don't have those luxuries or really want to mass units to advance on line regardless of what's in front of them that can result in stuck vehicles that are essentially mission kills until they are recovered. That's a good way to suffer serious attrition without a shot fired.

That isn't to say the Russians or Ukrainians have only been road bound and haven't been able to take advantage of dry and firm off-roading so far, it's just very much localized, often improvised, likely needs recon, and can be risky. Very day to day and area dependent.

But as things dry the randomness ends, routes open up, planning becomes easier, execution becomes less risky, and it becomes harder for Ukrainians to know where attacks will come from and it'll be harder to mass forces in every possible location as opposed to when there are limited routes.

But then again, the good ground works in their favor when they do counterattacks or when they eventually launch counteroffensives.",94631b6d3c70962263745982450a8e6616bd9362,True,False,,,,,0,1651868622,,0,{},i7li36v,False,t3_ujlv6d,False,True,t1_i7kk0v0,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ujlv6d/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_06_2022/i7li36v/,1651868635,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651839822.0,

Overall, I think Russian strategy was not totally crazy:

* the first plan was #yolo Kyiv, that might have been the best choice, and it worked a few times before (Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Ukraine 2014). Considering Russia's maximalist goals, going slow and getting a few towns in Donbas per week wouldn't really achieve it, so it was this, or not try at all
* when that failed, the second plan was to encircle major cities, and shell Ukraine into submission - and it really looked like a lot of cities are going to be surrounded including Kyiv. If multiple major cities can get Mariupoled one by one, that might be enough to get some major concessions from Ukraine.
* third plan was to do big Donbas offensive, encircling and destroying Ukraine's best troops, while leaving just enough troops on Kherson and Kharkiv flanks to protect that - Kherson flank is still standing strong, Kharkiv flank is finally falling apart, but it lasted pretty much as long as the Donbas offensive itself, so it did its job

If Russian army was as good as their marketing materials say, and Ukraine army was as bad as back in 2014, none of these plans are insane. All these plans were crazy optimistic in retrospect, but there's some genuine thinking behind them.

Politically the third plan was already really sketchy, as there's no way to achieve maximalist goals by seizing Sievierodonetsk-Lysychansk. But from purely military point of view, it's difficult to come up with much better plans than these three than Russia actually attempted.

[],False,,bleepblopbloopy,,,[],,,,text,t2_4lu6l,False,False,"&gt; * This article reveals for the first time why a Nazi war criminal named Günter Ebeling who was employed by the American Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) in occupied Germany was violently killed by British intelligence officers.

&gt; * Discussions concerning security and control, not morality, usually surrounded disputes regarding the employment of Nazis.

&gt; * Close and comparative analysis of Ebeling’s recruitment and ‘dismissal’ with that of several other Nazis demonstrates that hindsight, source limitations and a prevalent case study approach have prevented the identification of common reasoning concerning security and control which surrounded the post-war employment of war criminals in several areas of intelligence work

&gt; * Indeed, new evidence suggests that the British and American intelligence services employed some Nazi war criminals in post-war Germany as part of a wider strategy of control designed to ensure the security of the occupation and pave the way for a future democratic Germany. 

&gt; * At a War Office meeting in January 1947… of a ‘unique and extremely melodramatic episode’ about which ‘very few officers’ knew ‘the full story’.1 This top secret information …can be found in a letter, tucked away near the back of a large Foreign Office folder concerning the infamous Bad Nenndorf detailed interrogation centre which was the subject of a torture scandal.2 Its contents, published here in unprecedented detail, are crucial to explaining the selective employment of Nazi war criminals by Anglo-American intelligence agencies in occupied Germany. 

&gt; * …in 1947, he was employed by the American Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) and known to the British and American intelligence services by his alias, Slim.6 He had first been employed by the CIC in 1945 when his services directly contributed to the successful completion of Operation Nursery.7 This operation involved the rounding up of a Nazi underground movement led by Artur Axmann, the head of the Hitler Youth.8 Since then, Slim had been helping the CIC to infiltrate other post-war Nazi movements.9 

&gt; * But, Slim’s rendezvous on January 18th was a trap.14 The three ID officers had been ordered to arrest him.15

&gt; * When Slim, who was ‘an extremely powerful man, standing 6ʹ6” high and broad in proportion’ realised he was under arrest, he: … fought all three British Intelligence officers with his bare hands for over half an hour.

&gt; * Almost twenty years later, Michael Salter rightly complained in the Journal of Intelligence History that many publications concerning the recruitment of Nazi war criminals still consisted of ‘investigative journalism and a stream of “exposé” style books’ which tended to be ‘one-sided’ in their negative portrayal of the recruiting intelligence services.29

&gt; * …the struggle for security was not just a struggle against communism, but also one against Nazism, as this article will make clear.

&gt; * …the need to deny the Soviets scientific and technical knowledge as a key, if not the key, motive behind the employment of Nazi scientists by the Western intelligence services.42

&gt; * The fact that the Allied intelligence services were initially recruiting some Nazi war criminals to use against Nazi underground groups has received little attention, although it is important for understanding later recruitment practices.

&gt; * The CIC also seemed satisfied with Slim’s explanation for switching sides. He believed that ‘if all the wanted people are turned in and all underground movements are destroyed, the occupational forces will leave Germany, thus enabling Germany to regain self-rule’.53

&gt; * Still, Slim’s closeness to high ranking Nazis must have caused some discomfort amongst the CIC as he eerily felt compelled to remind them: ‘“One loves the information and not the informant”’.55

&gt; * As this evidence suggests, the ability to control and issues concerning security, much more than moral considerations, were key factors for both British and American intelligence when deciding which Nazis to employ and which Nazis to arrest in post-war Germany.

&gt; * For example, a 1947 American military intelligence report concerning the ‘Present Status of the Nazi Threat’ made clear that in aiming to establish an enduring democratic system in Germany (or, ‘in giving the Germans some rather intensive, on-the-job training in Democracy’), the Americans were fighting two wars at once, one against the far left and another against the far right.60

&gt; * As this evidence suggests, the ability to control and issues concerning security, much more than moral considerations, were key factors for both British and American intelligence when deciding which Nazis to employ and which Nazis to arrest in post-war Germany. 

&gt; * …it could be argued that the employment of Nazi war criminals as intelligence agents was part of a wider strategy of divide and rule.

&gt; * …one of the best methods of controlling Nazi war criminals and reducing the security threat which they posed, was to recruit some of them.

&gt; * Because censorship in occupied Germany was extensive, the intelligence services could keep a particularly close watch on the communications of their employees. 

&gt; * As the former Chief of the British ID, Charles Haydon, reflected in a lecture on intelligence operations given in the 1960s:
“There is nothing particularly pleasant, or indeed ethical, in the idea of Intelligence operations … . Accept then – if you like – that Intelligence is a distasteful business, but accept, also, that – like medicine – it has to be taken if the body is to be kept healthy (and wise).136”

They can infiltrate SOF recon teams but there are only so many units trained for that job, they usually have to be rotated in and out regularly for rest and refit, and that's not the one area the UA brass want intelligence on. They can use other local HUMINT sources too for intel and targeting, but the issue will be they can harass that supply line but they can't cut it without actually physically taking that ground or destroying the means of transportation somehow..

&gt;Anyway, if I was a russian commander, I'd be getting nervous about that line communication by now, even if it's not under immediate threat yet. 

There are worse things to be nervous about. They have to know this offensive is their last hurrah to achieve a ""victory"", it's worth accepting the risk on their flanks to try to focus on the mission at hand. All for nothing time, this is 4th quarter, two minutes left,  no timeouts and down by 5, they can't fuck around. 

Besides, this situation is why maps without unit markers only showing colors of who holds what ground are near useless. The Kharkiv counterattacks seem scary until you find out it's all being done by two understrength brigades (at least according to Jomini of the West maps), and only one of them is mechanized. That mean two very narrow thrusts where they overextend themselves the deeper they go. If it was two UAF mech divisions worth of brigades, that's a different story. But it doesn't appear to be, which means it's just a spoiling attack, so the correct decision is to ignore it as much as possible and don't let it spoil the offensive. Keep the initiative, don't cede it, especially if it's because they take counsel of their fears.

If the Russian brass are wrong, what happens? Their current offensive fails and that northern supply line gets cut and they need to expand to use those eastwards in the future. But if they respond with a large force to stop the counterattack then the offensive fails anyways.

Demand growth may start flattening in 10-20 years, but it will take many decades for demand to start dropping significantly and like you said, even then there will still be a lot of demand.   


The truth is, there has already been a lot of foreign interest and invesment in Ukraine and its oil/gas. They seem to think Ukrainian oil/gas development would be ""starting from scratch"" for some reason, despite the fact that Ukraine already has oil/gas companies (who had more of their own rigs until Russia stole them in 2014). That person doesn't even seem to know any of this.   


Russia invaded Crimea just a couple years after oil/gas exploration companies revealed just how much gas Ukraine has... then Ukraine started signing contracts with more foreign companies in 2020 and 2021 to start developing it and Russia invades again...  


I agree with you and others, I think Russia felt threatened by Ukraine. It may not be purely about oil and gas, but economics certainly plays a role in Putin's calculation.  


Between 2008 and 2014 foreign investment in Russia was basically flat, then 2014 it plummeted and never recovered. At the same time foreign investment in Ukraine has been growing very fast from 2004 til 2014 then dropped off thanks to Russia but quickly started growing again until Russia invaded again.

I don't think so.
First, the quote I've seen said 3 - 4 months.
Second, depending up how you define the mission, I think that's feasible. ""Transition"" training (learning how to fly the F-16 takes about 10 sorties (plus simulators), but then you have to learn to employ it, i.e., air to air, wingman, dropping bombs, air refueling, etc. The difficulty I see is that there's a set curriculum that leads a new F-16 pilot to that level and thence to an active squadron. Here's the problem: there is no curriculum that I'm aware of that shortcuts the whole existing program in order to have a new F-16 pilot just  challenge MiGs over Ukraine. These programs pile the learning on - something you learn later in the program suddenly makes something  earlier make sense, and that's what you skip with an abbreviated program.

Still, I think air-to-air could be done in 3 - 4 months by throwing money at it - hire (expensively) one F-16 trainer per student, if necessary. Bump a few simulator spots would help, and some NATO pilots' currency regs might have to be waived, but I think it could be done. 

The hardest part would be maintenance, but I don't think with MiGs Ukraine is used to a ""fly two (sorties) - turn one"" sortie rate, anyway. IIRC Russian aircraft were designed to fly once every two days. (At least that's what I recall.) Maybe it's time to try assisted maintenance, like a Zoom call, with Ukrainian maintainers connected to NATO maintainers and walk them through procedures. Think of it as a Quick Uplift Program - beta test.",d506f4eb4b3b2c022877c3d89b28dafe85d03bee,True,False,,,,,0,1651860988,,0,{},i7l1e2l,False,t3_ujlv6d,False,True,t1_i7ksi4r,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ujlv6d/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_06_2022/i7l1e2l/,1651861004,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651832188.0,

Aren't they supposed to be able to significantly hamper that GLOC once they get within artillery range? They've already got 90% of M777s, so as long as they are able to deploy those to that front, the 60km gets cut by a lot, even without boosted shells. 

I'm also curious if they can successfully infiltrate special forces behind enemy lines like they did to stalk the infamous 40 mile convoy. 

Anyway, if I was a russian commander, I'd be getting nervous about that line communication by now, even if it's not under immediate threat yet. 

&gt;
Which is a further reason for the Russians not to do it, if they shift substantial forces to stop the Kharkiv counterattack they're admitting defeat to their superiors in Moscow as well as their subordinates.

On the other hand, not shifting forces there is a gamble because if they're forced to run back to Belgorod the same problem applies, unless they get a decisive breakthrough in the east.

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"For the Russians, they appear to have limited the number of forces around Kharkiv, aka an economy of force operation. The city itself holds no strategic value, taking it changes nothing especially when considering the cost to either assault or surround/lay siege to the city. It holds no operational value either, besides forcing Ukraine troops to defend it as well as responding to/diverting resources trying to limit Russian artillery firing on it.

From the Ukrainian perspective they launched counterattacks from around Kharkiv for two reasons. One, to relieve the threat of the city itself and to push the Russians out of artillery range. Two, to conduct a spoiling attack to push into a weak Russian sector in the hopes to cause Russians to panic, especially over fear of the northern directed supply lines heading to Belgorod and Voronezh, causing them to divert troops that would be used in the Severodonetsk Salient offensive, that is the main effort for the entire war, which is a separate operational area than the Kharkiv area (separate military district HQ in command).

Why would Russia need to divert troops from Izyum to reinforce those east of Chuhuiv and Staryi Saltiv? Both of those cities are on the west bank of the Donets and still very far away from GLOC heading north from Izyum. Now if Ukraine conducted a successful river crossing in both sectors and achieved a breakthrough heading east, then yes, the Russians would have to commit reserves to stop them. But that hasn't happened yet. So if they did move troops now they'd be doing exactly what the Ukrainians want while succumbing to their fears. 

Meanwhile, the Russian forces arrayed at Izyum, especially in the second echelon reserves were supposed to have already achieved a breakthrough on the road heading to Sloviansk, but that hasn't happened because UAF built a very deep and credible defense that has mostly stymed it besides SW drive heading towards Barvinkove. But they are having some success near Lyman and Rubizhne, who probably need more troops to exploit success, especially if they don't suspect a strong force of Ukrainian defenses behind those places. So divert massed reserves behind Izyum to those places, reinforce success. 

I could be wrong but that's my take and it makes sense. But for all we know the tweet about the movement is bullshit, bad reporting or outright fiction. Or maybe it's a just a Russian feint to try to get UA to thin out their Izyum defenses to also head east, and the UA released the info because they bought it. Or maybe the UA know it's a feint and they released it because they want the Russians to think they bought the feint. We can't know now, only speculate.

Russia doesn't have all that many targets. Black Sea Fleet was about 40 surface ships. Ukraine says it destroyed or damaged 11 (with +1 in today's update). Oryx says 6. Either way, there's 30-35-ish left, and a lot of the smaller ones can be Bayraktared.

Even with the few Neptunes Ukraine has, it's a decent ratio of missiles to potential targets. If they managed to build 200 for 40 targets (and half of them drone-able), ugh, Russian Black Sea Fleet would be screwed.

Yes, I agree.

Yes. The US is committed to direct involvement if China use force on Taiwan already.

People seem to be wondering why this has leaked. 

First, can I say, I don't believe this is a ""loose lips sink ships"" moment....I think its pretty clear that there was permission to give these off-the-record briefings. I don't believe US Intelligence officials just casually let that kind of info out as a ""mistake"" or by ""being too chatty and gregarious"".

So, assuming it was an ""official unofficial leak"", I have my own theory of the motivation.

Which is, essentially, this is the US pushing back on Russian nuclear threats and/or the impression Russia/Putin has that ""the west is weak and won't follow up on any red lines if it puts them at risk"".

I've heard it said that Putin takes any attempt at negotiation/peaceful solutions/compromises as a sign of weakness .... an unwillingness to fight for an issue .... and this emboldens him to take a maximalist approach and / or use violence / escalation to acheive his ends, reassured by the fact that ""as the west is attempting to negotiate, it will just accept my escalation as it clearly doesn't want to get involved here"".

I see this as the first part of an attempt to take onboard that logic..... and start using it to push back on Putin, and project to him strength that makes him consider the west means it when they say they will respond to (say) NBC use or other escalations in the conflict.

Basically, ""Yeah, we're doing this to your generals and your fleet, whaddya going to do about it ?"" as an attempt to show we won't back down and have finally stopped retreating / being conciliatory / avoiding escalation.

Afterall, Putin already *knew they were doing this*.... the signal here is *we're going to openly admit that we're doing this, to show you we don't care what you think of that*.

My take on it is that they are more or less [signalling this meme](https://imgur.com/gWL1LTU).",c1b153a8040ac3ddb1498db107220f29ddc90d00,True,False,,,,,0,1651855549,,0,{},i7kojnx,False,t3_ujlv6d,False,True,t3_ujlv6d,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ujlv6d/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_06_2022/i7kojnx/,1651855560,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651826749.0,

How is it possible that instead of using the troops around izium to reinforce the flank around kharkiv like most analysts I read suggest, Russia is actually sending those troops east?

I understand you take ir as focusing on where they're making progress and I agree it's possible. What I can't really understand is how they could ignore the Western flank but still hold izium.

Perhaps most Western sources are wrong and Russia isn't lacking manpower or Ukraine is actually in worst shape than we think.

In propaganda, Mossadegh nationalized Iran's oil industry, so he was overthrown to retain Western control over their oil. 

In actuality, Iran retained nationalized control of their oil industry, but had to honor distribution contracts which allowed BP to sell oil from the fields they had developed. They also obtained additional, albeit American, retail partners, all of which, if I recall correctly, had to share 50% of their retail profits with the Iranian government (regardless of the price-per-barrel production dividends that were owed to the Iranians under the contracts that were in force). 

It was, economically, the best deal the Iranians could have hoped for at the time given the state of the global commodities markets. And, in actuality, it can be argued that Operation Ajax was more of a counter-coup than a coup given the geopolitical situation of the time.

At this point ISW only uses Ukraine MOD press releases for their assessments. They seem to report every possible pro Ukraine rumor but don't reciprocate with rumors of Russian successes unless they're confirmed days later. Being pro Ukraine is fine, being so biased that Russian successes aren't mentioned until everyone else already did it makes for bad intelligence analyzing.

But even the Ukraine governor of Luhansk has openly reported most of Rubizhne has fallen, with other reports the Russians are now trying to cut off retreat of UA military and civilians leaving the city, plus attacking a city to the SE of it. This entire post chain is about a tweet saying Russians are moving more forces there and the Lyman area where they've also recently achieved results to reinforce success. That's not good for the Ukrainians and it's not disloyal or defeatist to say that. 

Besides, in the long run this can all be good for Ukraine. The more the Russians advance the more casualties they take they can't replace quickly even if they mobilize, the more munitions they expend from local stockpiles that continuously become depleted and can't be refilled quickly, the more ground they have to hold (every narrow front advance creates a small salient that turns flat frontage sector into an isosceles triangle with far more ground they need to defend against counterattacks), etc.

It has the potential to be successful but can also backfire. It's only a slightly more refined approach to the ""arrest and imprison everyone"" that many ""iron fist"" COIN strategies are founded on.

Essentially they round up  either everyone in an area or at least military aged males or those that might be a threat, put them in concentration camps somewhere in the secure rear, and while they're detained the Russians do background checks, interviews, etc to find out which are or might become insurgents based on previous on previous professions, military experience, political orientation, etc, and then they detain those indefinitely and release the rest. It's a proactive way to stop insurgencies before they start.

They created the name and technique during the 2nd Chechen War during the third battle of Grozny, which backfired and only resulted in the start of a decade long insurgency. And they taught it to the Syrians during their civil war. 

It's a continuation of the old Soviet SMERSH strategies used during WW2 when the Red Army reconquered their lost land and had to find out who had been collaborating with the Axis, who had been tainted by non communist ideology, etc. They basically deported everyone remotely capable of being a threat to Siberia, with many not released until Stalin died.

The negatives are that it requires the forces that can round everyone up, including those who resist being rounded up. It motivates everyone to resist once word gets out that the Russians are doing it elsewhere, so if they moved into area A and started filtration there and word gets out to area B, will they willingly get on the trucks?

Assuming the Russia army’s willingness to commit war crimes are true, even beyond morality it’s simply impractical and likely to inspire pitch-black terrorism campaigns with Russia in the future.

The filtration camps, from what I’ve seen, are a mixture of incompetence and don’t give a shit. They’re a processing point to separate people who might have military intel and civilians. Mass executions might be happening but frankly, every person they have doing such will be another body not fighting on the battlefield.

They can afford mistakes like that less and less.

More likely, this was just a prior order given. Pick up civilians. Dump inside Russia. Consider them Russian. Figure stuff out from there. If they are having logistical troubles managing combat, I doubt they have much in the way prepared to accommodate the civilians.

Additionally, if they do just start mass raping and massacring people, then their command will likely not be happy because they need living prisoners to trade for their own. And potentially bargain for parts of the Donbas or Crimea if they start losing badly.

Chalk this up to following orders and half-assing it as they go along.

As an aside, “rape factories” are a stupid concept even beyond the issues of mortality because how very unlikely it would work. This kind of pointless atrocity and abuse will likely see mass miscarriages and suicide in best case scenario.

Even China would have a hard time ignoring this due to how similar it would be to Imperial Japan on a broad scale.

Personally I have an extremely negative view of Kissinger, but this subject is just as relevant today as back then, and I think he is correct in identifying the problem. Clearly just relying on massive retaliation and a nuclear arsenal is a recipe for disaster. That is actually in a lot of ways what Russia is now, a country without a practical or realistic conventional capability, wildly throwing around threats of nuclear retaliation to make up for it. It serves really only to destabilize the world rather than improve their own interests, in other words it the strategy of psychopaths not a state with any ideals.

Kissinger's answer I think is correct in half. He is wrong that there can be any idea of limited nuclear capabilities, that is likely a bone he throws to leadership of the time who will not accept any tying of hands behind the back by not using nukes in some capacity. But he is totally right that a strategy of honing localized, maneuverable, and extremely effective tactical elements is the right response to the modern conundrum. A sort of medium-rare approach to warfare, where the focus is on ensuring that the initial strike is blunted, but even more so initial weeks and months, because this is the period in which dissuasion can occur, and the feedback loop of war can be stopped before it is too late. If an aggressor like Russia has quick successes early on, say in a border skirmish, this will only encourage them to go further down the rabbit hole.

In practical terms, I think this does not mean increasing our counter-insurgency capabilities like has been the norm since the Vietnam war, but increasing our ability to back up actually popular regimes like Ukraine against salami slice tactics. Vietnam may have been a proxy war, but we weren't going to win it simply because the regime we were backing was not legitimate enough. The old adage ""you can't kill an idea."" Instead, we should focus again on becoming an arsenal of democracy, having the tools ready to share with countries that we know are in fights to win them. More development of artillery, anti-air, anti-tank, anti-ship, artillery detection, and battlefield taxis for the 21st century. At the very least, US support should be something that countries which go through the hoops we put up to get can actually feel making a tangible difference.

There has been no forced draft/mobilization in the US since 1973, the US had a volunteer army at the time of the Iraq War.

&gt;True, mobilisation will not improve your popularity. Can you afford it? Almost certainly. Will the alternative, losing the war in Ukraine, be even worse for your popularity? Aboslutely.

IMO, it depends on the brand of autocracy.

I'm of the view that calling for a general mobilization would violate the social contract between Putin and the population, ""yes, we have no hospital out here in the province and the pension is shit, but at least there's no war"".

And that would make a significant amount of people politically active instead of apolitical, which is dangerous for a regime that relies on its population being largely passive and apathetic, that's the ""brand"" they've chosen.

&gt;it was weird how their Izium offensive just ran out of steam all of a sudden, and no push from the south ever materialized.

The Russian forces in that area ended up successfully moving many units SW instead, but they had a large reserve of second echelon units who can't go anywhere at the moment so I guess they might want to use them to reinforce success to the east.

Also this might be bullshit. The Russians could be moving some units to the east where Ukrainians just lost some key ground in the hopes to bait the UAF to remove more troops currently defending a sector the Russians want to attack, or they might want a UAF reserve to be committed.

I remember all the small posts when the sub died down and the great posts where people offered translations etc

But any time the war heats up it gets filled with jingoistic low quality comments and people hysterical that anyone who disagrees is a russian bot.

Despite all the criticism of scholz and the German government just discussing that people were claiming it’s “Russian disinfo” and some huge number of Germany posters regularly circle the wagons to a shameless degree.

It got embarrassing one post they were calling the Ukrainian ambassador a “cretin” and a “troll” and it became as if it was a German nationalist sub discussing Ukraine.

You couldn’t even discuss the realities of the German deliveries being delayed and likely won’t get there for months, maybe July earliest if they’re not further delayed. Just filled with silly cheerleading and people getting defensive.


Even recently I was talking in General about how it’s a real issue how only now all the west’s weapon shipments are ramping up and it will be weeks before they’re getting there and then to the front.

I was speaking about how Russians are using 100,000s of artillery shells daily and it’s a big issue if the west doesn’t learn that too little too late is becoming their pattern so the German shipments likely arriving long after this huge battle thay will be very decisive is mostly done will be a shame.

I was downvoted and the person replying to me with “ this isn’t a big battle the big battle will be when Ukraine retakes crimea blah blah” was upvoted heavily.

That’s when I realised the quality of the sub is lacking at times, when someone can deny how serious the situation is and start cheerleading about taking Crimea as if it’s that simple.


I do love the sub because it’s good when you want a place always free of pro-russian idiots. But sometimes the low quality hopium only is annoying.

Even after the mod post saying stop accusing anyone who disagrees of being Russian bots, people still sometimes do it.


It’s just embarrassing when there was that post saying ghost of Kyiv has destroyed 40 planes in the past 3 days, anyone who tried to speak sense was downvoted.

Then just hours later a post from official Ukrainian sources said no so and so was not the ghost of Kyiv and no they didn’t shoot 40 planes ( or was it claimed even 60 idk).

Some people there are suffering from the echo chamber.

I first realised it when there was a discussion over whay ukrianian losses might be.

Someone in a chain said 1:3. Then another replied “ nah I think more like 1:5”

Then someone who was upvoted most responded “ honestly I think it could be 1:7 but as high as 1:10”

I don’t go on pro Russian telegrams because I get depressed seeing Ukrainian heroes dead and psychopathic putinists praising it.

But it obvious they have serious losses.  All those air strikes and missile strikes are no joke and Russians are using artillery volume as a huge crutch. The Ukrainians admit there are losses and will be released after the war. They’ve admitted to heavy losses but inflicted yet heavier on the Russia’s now in donbass.



But on the sub people are totally insulated from that and because they don’t want to believe it- even if just to take seriously we need to demand a hastened and increased weapons supply- they dismiss it entirely.

I still believe Ukraine will win as they get requirement advantage and they have the intelligence, genius and morale of fighting for their existence. 

I still think the sub is great and especially good if you accept you’re only seeing good news.

The thing is, as long as America has interests and allies in the region China cannot achieve this. Taiwan may be the key to this, but China will have to be confident it can defeat not only the US but the US and it’s allies which is a hopeless proposition. Japan will almost certainly enter the fight, Australia too and more than likely a few members of NATO as well. 

&gt; Since China does not seek global dominance, they are more open to negotiating with other nations on more favorable terms.

China would *like* global dominance. It suits the idea of China being the Middle Kingdom and having a superior people and culture (common thought in China). But it’s just not achievable as China cannot hope to match the western world on its own. Just look at the words coming out of Putins puppets right now. They thought their actions along with partnering China would be the end of the west, but it’s proving to not quite be the case.

&gt; Every rising power understands this, Since the Americans want global dominance, this means that Americans will not be willing to allow India to become the preeminent power in South Asia or Iran in the Middle East. What will happen if one day India becomes more powerful just like China?

He wrote a book about the causes of WW1, *The Pity of War*, which challenges the view of other well respected and known historians such as AJP Taylor, Barbara Tuchman, and Robert Massie, namely:

* Germany before 1914 was not a militarist country, in fact it was anti-militarist.

* That Britain's worries about German Naval expansion were unfounded.

* That Britain sought an Alliance with France and Russia instead of Germany (which was a very real prospect in 1905, especially after Fashoda and the Russo-Japanese War) because Britain thought Russia and France were the stronger power and not because they were wary of German plans and claims.

Reportedly, at least someof the M777 are at the frontlines already and being used by UA (Congressional briefing by SecDef Austin on May 3rd said they were being used).

[Was a link here. A ""thedrive"" article]
&gt;Earlier in the day, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin confirmed today that 155mm M777 towed howitzers, which were recently transferred to the Ukrainian military, are now being actively employed in combat against Russian forces.

This likely isn't the bulk of the 90. If you remember.... about a week before the US announced that 81 were going, they had announced 9 were going.

I suspect its that first 9 that are at the front already, along with the first tranche of 50-odd trainees.

[Was a link here. A ""thehill"" article]
&gt;Now, more than 220 Ukrainians have been trained on U.S. artillery, particularly the M777 Howitzer, a 10,000-pound system that can be towed by vehicles and hit targets up to 18 miles away with 155 mm rounds. Washington has promised 90 such systems to Kyiv.

So it seems the first units of heavy equipment are getting there, on top of the light equipment that is already there. 

We can expect more to come over the next week or two.... the rest of the towed howitzers.... some of the SPG that were announced early like the Ceasars.... Perhaps some of the early Polish/Solvak/Czeck donations of Ex-Sov IFVs/APCs/Tanks.

[],False,,robothistorian,,,[],,,,text,t2_2inubrvw,False,False,"&gt;* &gt;The narrative that UW represents an authoritative source that provides valuable insight the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) follows is extremely problematic.

No, it does not. Among other things, ""[The Science of Military Strategy](https://www.amazon.com/Science-Military-Strategy-2013-Translation/dp/1987678451)"" may be considered to be a formal document of the PRC.

&gt;* &gt;The book is unoriginal, not authoritative, both the authors themselves and examples from history contradict their thesis and much of the writing is designed to sound profound, but falls flat under closer examination.

One could argue that Clausewitz's ""On War"" is also unoriginal and that it seeks to sound profound but does not hold up under a closer analysis.

Both these assessments are wrong, in my opinion.

&gt;* &gt;Moreover, the authors do not provide an applicable plan for a military to follow

Even a casual perusal of the text will show that this was not the intent of the authors. They were more interested in sketching out a macro-view of how they saw war and it's conduct changing. I would not go to the extent of saying that they were attempting to posit a ""theory of war"", but they were in some places in the text certainly ""theorising war"".

&gt;* &gt;The authors go on to explain the United States is ill-prepared to handle the new expanded battlefield particularly in regards to nonmilitary war and non-state actors (such as terrorist organizations) because a lack of unified strategy or command structure

Were they wrong? After all, the US had to withdraw from both Iraq and Afghanistan. Some even go to state that it was a defeat of US political and military strategy.

&gt;* &gt;The whole idea of the book is that war is fundamentally changed and become “unrestricted”, going beyond the sphere of the military. However, the authors correctly point out this is rarely if ever the case with this example in ancient times.

This is a discussion that continues in many ""war studies"" departments (but interestingly not in think-tanks and military organisations). The main question is this: Does the ""nature"" of war change? (theorists like Colin Gray argue that it does not - they assert that it is eternal). Thus one finds some research groups/departments like the ""Changing Character of War"" (in Oxford) focusing on this angle. There are others who assert that human history has been marked by a number of ""discontinuities"" (for example, in an unrelated context, Maglish makes this argument). These ""discontinues"" are fundamental and profound and they change how we think about and related to the world. The argument runs that such profound changes also impacts the ""nature"" of war. This is a rather difficult concept to come to terms with but there is a good body of literature on this.

&gt;* &gt;In a now declassified document titled, “The Inauguration of Organized Political Warfare” by George F. Kennan dated April 30, 1948 on the very first page it defines political warfare as, “the employment of all the means at a nation’s command, short of war, to achieve its national objectives”.24 This sounds suspiciously like the nebulous definition the authors provide for unrestricted warfare. 

There is nothing surprising about this. One does not need to look at Kennan for inspiration. One could go as far back as the probiotics, specifically, Heraclitus for insights about this. The Chinese (like the Indians) also have their ancient philosophers who have referred to the all-encompassing nature of war.

&gt;* &gt;Four major factors likely contributed to UW’s popularity: availability, timing, branding and confirmation bias. 

Lol! One could say that for virtually any book! 

&gt;* &gt;Many of the stereotypical expectations of Chinese military strategy are met in the book involving indirect conflict and deception.

One cannot deny the fact that Chinese philosophy and literature is rife with the notion of deception and the use of ""cunning intelligence"". It is interesting to note that the latter notion - ""cunning intelligence"" - was also known in the time.of the Ancient Greeks and it was known as ""Metis"". Sadly, it was not theorized and fleshed out for a variety of reasons. If one is interested, I recommend checking out [Vernant and Detienne's classic text](https://www.amazon.com/Cunning-Intelligence-European-Philosophy-Sciences/dp/0226143473/ref=mp_s_a_1_13?crid=3CQT5NX0S5A2E&amp;keywords=vernant+and+detienne&amp;qid=1651837326&amp;sprefix=vernant+and+detienn%2Caps%2C359&amp;sr=8-13) on this. I also strongly recommend checking out [Lisa Raphal's (also classic) text](https://www.amazon.com/Knowing-Words-Cunning-Classical-Traditions/dp/0801426197/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?crid=1NCPKPN02IJSS&amp;keywords=knowing+words&amp;qid=1651837527&amp;refinements=p_n_feature_browse-bin%3A2656020011&amp;rnid=618072011&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=knowing+words%2Caps%2C283&amp;sr=1-1) which also deals with this (but in a comparative analysis between the Ancient Greek and Chinese concepts).

I’m sorry for the bad news.

Again, you keep willfully ignoring my point, China does not need to eclipse America. America is, and will remain, the single most important country on the planet for the foreseeable future. 'Victory' for China simply means it is the firmly the largest economy and dictating terms from a position of power in East/South East Asia like America does in South America. Taiwan is the ultimate key to this.

 The Chinese have no interest in militarily dominating the Caribbean sea because they recognize that is too close to America's core interest. Since China does not seek global dominance, they are more open to negotiating with other nations on more favorable terms. 

Every rising power understands this, Since the Americans want global dominance, this means that Americans will not be willing to allow India to become the preeminent power in South Asia or Iran in the Middle East. What will happen if one day India becomes more powerful just like China? The Americans will treat India just like they treated China now or Japan in the 80s because the Americans will never allow any country to challenge its global dominance.

Russia opposed them in Syria exactly the same way the US are opposing them now..... in fact, in an even more escalatory fashion (not just arms and intelligence to assad.....but ground forces and russian aircraft with russian pilots).

Did Meirshemer call on Russia to pull out of Syria lest the US nuke everyone as they felt threatened ? If he did, I missed it.

&gt;It is not the Meirsheimer logic that is twisted. It is our, Western, reaction to it. We are so used to having our own way that we no longer recognise a brick wall we are about to run into. 

No, Russia has provided arms in areas the US has fought for decades. They've gone further than this even.... particularly in places like Syria (troops, aircraft, pilots) and Vietnam (pilots, aircraft).

The US is doing in Ukraine a less escalatory version of what russia has done for years with proxies that were hostile to America. Even on America's doorstep.... A la Cuba, and Venezuela.

Its not ""we've always got ou own way"".

Its that ""Both sides have always done this. But only one side gets told not too lest the crazy-ruskies nuke us all, best let them invade the country they want to invade"".

Where were the calls for Cuba to capitulate with a Castro surrender and alignment of Cuba ""within the US sphere"" lest America nuke us all ?

Or the same in Venezuela.

Or for Russia to not provide troops to Assad, for the same reason ?

You seem to have missed the part where russia actively intervenes all over the world too.... and no-one ever tells them to stop it ""lest American nuke us all in a fit of rage at being thwarted in their Imperial Ambitions to invade $tiny_little_country"".

&gt;And invoking the Nazi appeasement is such a lazy argument. 

No, its not. In many other circumstances in recent history....it has been. Its overused.

But this is exactly the right situation to use it in.

An autocrat following an expansionary foreign policy where he is invading neighbouring countries that have not initiated a war with him. And doing so repeatedly, moving onto a new country every time he acheives his objectives in the previous one.

&gt;The entire art of diplomacy over its 4,000 years is about compromise and quid pro quo.

Yes, UA was ready to compromise.... If Putin would have offered them the deal of ""Fine, join the EU but don't join NATO and we'll be at peace"" they'd have taken it. Zelensky was elected on basically that platform.

He didn't want to find a compromise position UA could accept.

He wanted them as a Satellite state of Russia, and has shown he is prepared to use actual military force to get the outcome he wants.

&gt;Again, it's just that we, as the West, are used to getting everything our own way and have forgotten that we might ever need to make a concession.

Its not about ""the west"" getting its own way. 

The parties here are not ""Russia"" and ""the west""..... They are ""Russia"" and ""Ukraine"".

He needed to make concessions *to Ukraine* to get what he wanted. They were ready to do so. He wasn't prepared to ""offer concessions to a piddly-little power I could roll over with my tanks in a week, that'd be humiliating"".

I can't see how they are encircled.

I had a look at geo-located tweets/videos for the 93rd that gave a location to try and work out where they were. There are 3 in the past 3 days.

1 of geo-location of 93rd tanks around Izyium (blue circle in the map below) and 1 geo-location of 93rd artillery strikes (strike hit on the red circle, putting the artillery likely 15-20km from it), 1 claim of russia hitting the 93rd command post with artillery at podhilivka (purple circle) .

All of that indicates the 93rd front lines are roughly where I drew the green line.

I can't see how, even with a big breakthrough we haven't seen yet, they've encircled that unit there. There are about 3 quarters of the  compass points they could retreat to, all the way from  NE to Kharkiv, round to W to Sloviansk even if they were losing.... and there is no indication they are losing, or even being pushed back, as the lines there haven't moved in about a week and a half.

Russia only has forces to their North-West (the attack south of Izyium) and the Donetsk river (as well as the failure of the Kharkiv front for russia) prevents them putting troops behind them to their east/north east in any great numbers as the river runs across the top of the green line. 

I think this is just an extension of the 93rd Brigade copium from a few days ago (where a letter purportedly from 23 members of the 93rd refusing to fight) was taken as ""the surrender of the whole 93rd brigade"" by Russophile Twitter/Telegram.

China grew that much just like every country had explosive growth as the world economy started to work again. The US economy grew by 5.7% last year, but only a fool would say it’s going to grow that quick for decades. You are applying this logic to China which is ridiculous.

 &gt; Most economists agree that China will surpass the US on a nominal basis pretty soon, the only question is when exactly.

Can you provide sources for these that actually go into the details of *why* this will happen? I actually provided data on how productivity growth has slowed and the labor force has began to shrink. And how this compares to other economies in the past. What you’re talking about is people plotting graphs based on China’s growth in the 2010s. Which as the article I provided demonstrates, is a naive way of looking at economics. 

How is China going to grow that fast when no other Asian economy could. When China has even worse demographics, is much poorer in per capita terms, is actively being targeted by other major economies and has slower productivity growth than other economies that stagnated *under better conditions*. 

China won’t grow by 5 or 6% this year, that’s a old estimate. Even the ever optimistic IMF has slashed their projections for the Chinese economy to grow by 4.4% this year. Source [here](https://carnegieendowment.org/chinafinancialmarkets/87007).

&gt; The fact you randomly brought 'the West' to brush this off shows you have a serious bias.

It’s not random though. In a geopolitical contest the US will and should play to its strengths. The number 1 strength being that the western world essentially follow the United States.  China’s population is going to plummet in this century, and by 2100 it will have double the population of the US instead of nearly 5x as it does now. Source [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2020/09/03/chinas-population-to-drop-by-half-immigration-helps-us-labor-force/?sh=31b8fecd3d65).

I think it’s rich for you to call me out for having bias, when I am the only one providing sources for my claims. You on the other hand are throwing around numbers and saying economists claim this without actually backing it up. What you want for China compared to the reality don’t mesh. 

You are arguing that China will do what no county in history has done before. Explosive growth with a rapidly ageing population with a shrinking workforce. Japan couldn’t do it with a situation that was far less severe and with higher per capita wealth. Europe couldn’t do it without mass migration, a option China cannot take due to the amount needed and the massive ethnocentrism in China.

Only a fool would suggest that the US was going to solely dominate the world since it’s unipolar moment. But the US is set to still be the strongest player on the world stage. China is going to be and is very strong, but none of the data indicates that China will truly eclipse the United States.

Russia being knocked out of the Great Power ranks is not the same as an Invasion of Russia, nor is it an existential threat to Russia.

And.... if you allow Meirshema's logic being correct, then Russia can invade anywhere it likes (except another nuclear power) and the logic holds. Anytime they invade somewhere, we have to let them win.... otherwise they might lose and nuke us all as ""losing an aggressive invasion is an existential threat that will cause them to use nukes"". He can conquer as much of Asia and Europe as he likes, right up to the French border.

I think the realist FP logic points exactly the other way to what Meirsheimer is claiming here.

If Russia learns that it can invade anywhere, and the mere fact it owns nukes means the rest of the world is powerless to intervene with even a response as limited as ""send arms and intelligence to the invaded nation""..... it will keep invading places until eventually they do cause a nuclear escalation as the RotW decide they have to be stopped somewhere, somehow, and the snowball has got so big they can't be halted/defeated with mere ""conventional military aid"" anymore and it becomes a NATO/Russia hot war.

Being unable to make Ukraine a part of NATO we have been doing a creeping NATO-isation of Ukraine since 2014. We've been training them, we've been arming them, shipments of heavy weapons were on the table.

From Russia's standpoint, it doesn't matter whether Ukraine is in NATO formally, if it is a NATO-armed, NATO-supported, NATO-trained hostile country that does what NATO tells it to.

In other words, it's not the formal NATO membership that threatens Russia's security. It is the tangible threat of having a powerful, hostile, NATO-controlled state touching Russia's heartland.

1: ""a war instigated by a major power which does not itself become involved.""

US didn't start the vietnam war and it definitely ""became involved"".  When your regular army is conducting mass-scale military operations, that's not just involvement, but direct involvement.

2: ""A proxy war is an armed conflict between two states or non-state actors which act on the instigation or on behalf of other parties that are not directly involved in the hostilities.""

Again, while South Vietnam was the original aggressor, both it and the US were explicitly directly involved, and as such from their perspective it was clearly not a proxy war.

3. ""occurs when a major power instigates or plays a major role in supporting and directing a party to a conflict but does only a small portion of the actual fighting itself.""

The US did far more than ""a small portion"".  It's the heaviest and bloodiest conflict we've been involved in since WW2.

4. ""Proxy wars are conflicts in which a third party intervenes indirectly in a pre-existing war in order to influence the strategic outcome in favour of its preferred faction.""

The US as a third party intervened very, very directly.

""Proxy warfare is best defined as the direct or indirect sponsorship of third-party conventional or irregular forces that lie outside of the constitutional order of states engaged in armed conflict.""

Clearly not.

Again, educate yourself, for once.

Wrong.

I note that you couldn't find room in that comment to detail exactly what that logic is supposed to be. To be sure, I don't remember doing anything but asking OP to share why he's convinced these actions in questions risk escalating the conflict.

Neither I or the person I replied to used the word ""novel"" and even if that word had been used, it would be meaningless in this context. So that part of it seems to be something you just decided to make up.

As for ""escalatory"", this is seriously your argument: ""Anything Ukraine's allies didn't do before this latest conflict can ONLY have been due to assessment of the risk of escalation of a potential conflict, NOTHING else. Therefore anything Ukraine's allies are doing now to assist that country in repelling this invasion can ONLY be viewed in terms of whether or not they can said to be to escalate the conflict and nothing else.

Terrible logic. Which explains why your comeback is also terrible and doesn't even make sense as a response to the question asked. So let me rephrase, so you can give a straight answer:

-Putin gambled that if he provided weapons to separatists in the Donbass, there would be a massive uprising in the Russian speaking east that would force Ukraine to allow the Donbass (and hence Russia) a veto over Ukrainian foreign and economic policy rather than having itself balkanize into oblivion. When there wasn't, Putin had to throw his own troops into the mix just to keep Ukraine from retaking everything.

-Putin gambled that the West wouldn't respond to his aggression in Ukraine. When they slapped a set of sanctions on him, he was forced to come to the table and sign an agreement that if he actually followed to the letter, would more or less remove his entire reason behind occupying the Donbass.

-Putin gambled that after a while Ukraine would tire of Russia occupying part of its territory and throwing shells over the border, and that it would eventually give up on regaining control over it. Instead they rearmed, eventually to the point that they could probably retake the Donbass unless Russia directly and publicly intervened.

-Putin gambled that the West would rather trade away Ukraine's future rather than see a destructive war on their border. When they refused to negotiate, he was forced to invade just to avoid looking weak.

[],False,,Voteins,,,[],,,,text,t2_12yjl9,False,False,"As has been remarked before, Putin has a tenancy to act without fully thinking out the potential consequences of his actions. He gambles but doesn't have a response when things don't go his way. That's what got him into this situation in the first place.

It's been quite clear from the beginning that Putin doesn't want a ""neutral"" Ukraine, but rather he requires it be Russian aligned. Not being in the EU/NATO isn't enough, Ukraine must be in an economic/political union with Russia for Putin to be satisfied. By this account, his policies towards Ukraine have been dismal failures.

In 2014 he pressured Viktor Yanukovych to cancel a pending EU association agreement in favor of one with Russia, probably though some sort of personal bribe/threat. He didn't even consider that the Ukrainian people might realize they were getting the raw end of this deal, so he was totally offput when they revolted and threw Yanukovych out of power. He reacted by seizing Crimea and foment unrest in the Donbass, hoping with the latter to force Ukraine into making constitutional changes that would allow the Russian dominated region to veto any future EU engagement (making growing closer with Russia the only option for Ukraine's future growth). But Ukraine managed to defeat the Russian backed separatists and Putin was forced to throw in the regular  Russian army to prevent the region from falling back under Kiev's control. Although he was successful, by this time the US/EU had imposed a set of sanctions that threw the Russian economy into a recession. Politically and economically unprepared for war, Putin was forced into agreeing to a deal that would theoretically allow the Donbass a veto over any Ukrainian deals with the EU, but only after Ukraine had ""regained control"" over the region. Since Ukraine would undoubtedly  try to jail all the separatist leaders after retaking the area because of the wide variety of Bucha-like crimes they'd been committing, Russia couldn't uphold the letter of the ceasefire agreement without defacto losing control of the region. So all Russia could do was try to convince Ukraine to drop the ""regaining control"" thing.

Unfortunately for Putin, by occupying Crimea and the Donbass he'd removed the most pro-Russian segments of the population from the electorate and royally pissed over the rest. The newly reformed Ukrainian leadership was in no mood to bargain, and continued to make integration with the EU/NATO (and not Russia) their explicit goal. And the West proved increasingly willing to provide Ukraine with military assistance. Over the next 8 years Ukraine rearmed while it continue to argue with Russia over the Donbass. The Brexit and the election of Trump, which Putin really hoped would interfere, didn't end up slowing that down nearly enough. Then in 2020 the 2nd Nagorno-Karabakh War showed that a modern, drone armed force could easily defeat one based on Soviet hand-me-downs. The Ukrainians were watching, especially the effectiveness of the TB2 drones. They promptly bought a couple dozen, which started arriving on the JFO frontline in mid-late 2021 to good effect. It was looking pretty clear that the Ukrainians were planning on forcibly retaking the Donbass, and the only way Russia could prevent this was to defend it with its own troops.

After a test run in the summer of 2021 Putin made his move, deploying Russian troops around Ukraine. That an actual invasion was being considered was a tightly kept secret. Even the soldiers themselves didn't know. But then Biden did something that Putin, a former spy, could never have foreseen. He just... told everyone Putin was planning an invasion. The US revealed it was able to penetrate the very highest levels of the Russian state, risking losing that ability after the Russians figured out how. No doubt there was some screaming at the CIA, but evidently Biden thought it was worth it.

Well now with the US shouting from the rooftops about Russian aggression, if Putin backs down he looks like a coward. Plus, that doesn't solve the problem of Ukraine threatening to retake the Donbass. So Putin throws down an aggressive list of demands, all focused at NATO, hoping the threat a major war on their border will convince them to negotiate Ukraine's future away a la the Munich conference. But Biden at least was fine with Ukraine would turning into another Afghanistan for the Russians if they were foolish enough to actually invade, and refused to meet with Russia separately. Meanwhile Russian troops out in the forests of Belarus are getting drunk, harassing the locals, and increasingly getting sick with COVID.

Out of options, Putin gambles that with a single overwhelming thrust he can topple the Ukrainian government so quickly that the population will be too shocked to mount an effective insurgency. To everyone's surprise the Ukrainians weren't able just to resist, but even throw back the Russians, putting Putin in an even worse position than he was in 2014.

&gt; * But do you think that limited nuclear war is possible? 

I think that many things are possible, so in a word; yes. However the chances of straying into existentially threatening an opponent, and triggering their full strategic nuclear response, is far too high for this to be attempted. 

I think of it as too opponents who hate and distrust one another, and one or both (or neither!) is hoping to enter into a limited fist fight with the other, hoping that their strikes won't be perceived as too extreme by their adversary in the heat of combat. It is possible to achieve, surely we have seen many unlikely results in history, but so unlikely that the odds are far too risky for a downside far too costly. 

&gt; * Can nuclear belligerents agree to keep the use of nuclear weapons limited so as to avoid a complete collapse of deterrence? (Consider the fact that the U.S. and the U.S.S.R./Russia agreed to mutual inspections of their most sensitive installations, territory overfly through the Open Skies treaty, and mutual reductions in the size of their arsenals, propositions which would have had you laughed out of the room in the 1950s) 

I am going to answer no to this one. It is perhaps arrogant to think that something in the course of all mankind cannot be achieved, however I cannot see this happening and I would be lying if I tried to act circumspect here. 

The agreements that were achieved during the Cold War were very difficult to accomplish and took a lot of effort and verification which took considerable time and resources. In a nuclear war the reaction times are short and the consequences existential. Being able to trust your hated opponent when they have just killed millions of your people is unlikely.

There is of course the other reason that this could not be agreed to. Which is that it would be seen as one side or the other (or both!) to encourage the opponent to use limited nuclear war to get concessions. In the real world the US would never agree to such a thing due to the mistrust and incentives that Russia has to use them as they are the weaker side conventionally. 

&gt; * Should small nuclear unit tactics make a comeback in U.S. doctrine? 

My opinion is no to smaller, shorter range weapons. The short range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) reach their targets very fast, which means that an opponent has a much smaller time to react. This means that the actor who is faced with a short time to make a decision to *use or lose* their own weapons. The chances for a mistake or misreading of intentions is much higher with these weapons and the IMF treaty was agreed to because both sides could their inherently destabilizing nature. The famous Able Archer crisis was in part (there were other factors of course) because the Soviets were worried they had only small amount of time to react.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate-Range_Nuclear_Forces_Treaty

As for something like a road mobile nuclear deterrent in the US, I am also going to have to say no as the post on the forum recently convinced me of their argument.

https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ua8wp0/nuclear_hell_on_wheels_examining_the_need_for_a/

As for smaller sized, dispersed units of nuclear ICBMs to act as part of the strategic US nuclear deterrent, then yes this could be a good idea. The increased survivability would mean that the total number of weapons could be decreased. 

&gt; * Can the current nuclear triad deliver the same effect of uncertainty and surprise than small units? 

Yes. But certainty is a very positive thing in nuclear deterrents, perhaps the most important factor in deterrence being credibility. And surprise in nuclear weapons deterrence is a very bad thing in regards to nuclear deterrence as it is destabilizing. If you can surprise your opponent then their deterrence is greatly decreased, they will have to either consider surprising you in an attack or build more weapons to increase the survivability of his own deterrent. You could say that the two goals in nuclear weapons are to increase certainty, and to decrease the possibility of surprise. 

I may be misinterpreting your question or meaning here.

&gt; * Can current triad platforms achieve territory denial and frustration of enemy resources as effectively as small units?

No. Current strategic nuclear weapons can be seen coming, and will be presumed to be part of a massive attack. For example nuclear capable bombers are tracked by satellite and ICBMs can be seen in their high trajectories by radar. This means that their utility to deny specific pieces of territory by attacking forces or land are zero, as these strikes would require a limited nuclear attack. And the current nuclear forces will not be perceived that way by the opponent. 

There was a post recently about nuclear planning under the Carter administration that called for a way to use nuclear weapons at a lower threshold to using the entire SIOP. But was scrapped as it was seen as destabilizing and impossible to control the escalation.

Smaller nuclear weapons that are delivered by cruise missiles are seen by some as having deterrence value due to their not being seen as a potential ICBM or bomber strike, and the idea that they are much likely to be used in response to a limited nuclear attack by your opponent. Giving a slap for a slap is more likely than a punch in retaliation to a slap. 

This is the idea behind SLCM-N. I don't agree entirely with this idea as the US can and should declare it will respond to nuclear strikes with its own nuclear deterrent, the old fashioned way, or by the new downsizable warheads on the SSBNs. But that is an opinion that I am willing to change given better information.

&gt;Based on U.S. intelligence, Bruce Cumings writes, “Kim Il-sung sensed the immense strategic blessing of a Chinese Communist victory . . . and therefore
in early 1947 he began dispatching tens of thousands of Koreans to fight with Mao and to swell the existing Korean units to division size, a ‘volunteer’ army
that prefigured the Chinese ‘volunteers’ that returned the favor in the fall of 1950.” Cumings, Korea’s Place in the Sun: A Modern History, updated ed. (New
York: W. W. Norton, 2005), 238– 239. This is a distilled version of an argument he makes in Cumings, The Origins of the Korean War, vol. 2, The Roaring of the
Cataract, 1947– 1950 (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1990), 350– 376. In light of Chinese and Russian archival sources, Kim Donggil refutes this
argument, concluding, “Chinese documents verify that ethnic Korean units in the PLA [People’s Liberation Army] were indigenous in Northeast China
and that the North Korean regime never dispatched soldiers to Manchuria to assist Communist China during the Chinese Civil War.” Kim, “Prelude to
War?”


Have you actually read Kim's writing? 

Here.

&gt;At the end of World War II, two Korean anti-Japanese military forces remained in China; the first was an ethnic Korean anti-Japanese military force in China, the
Hanguk Kwangbokgun (Korean Independence Army), which was under the custody of the GMD government. This force had been subject to the Korean Provisional
Government established in 1919 first in Shanghai and later in Chongqing. After the surrender of Japan, hundreds of Korean Independence Army soldiers returned to
South Korea together with the Korean Provisional Government. Therefore, this group had no connection to any further discussion of ethnic Korean armies. **The other
military group was the Chosun Uiyongjun (Korean Volunteer Army, KVA), a force that was based near the Taihang Mountains in North China, and operated mainly in areas
containing high concentrations of Koreans. Despite being nominally subordinate to the CCP, the KVA retained a high degree of independence, and it regarded a Chinese
Communist victory over the Japanese as the best vehicle for the liberation of Korea. Mu Jeong was the KVA commander-in-chief, while Park Hyeosam and Park Ilu served
as deputy commanders**. The KVA also set up the Choson gunjeong daehak (Korean Military-Political Academy), a training school for its cadres in Yan’an.

...

&gt;In order to cooperate with the Soviet Red Army in China and Korea and to liberate the Korean people, the CCP planned to dispatch the Korean Volunteer Army to Korea.
In accordance with Zhu De’s order, on 12, 15, and 18 August, the Chosun Dongnip Dongmaeng (Korean Independence Federation, KIF), the political arm of the KVA,
promulgated propaganda leaflets. These leaflets called for Koreans serving in the Japanese and Manzhouguo armies to surrender to the Eighth Route Army and the New
Fourth Army, and encouraged them to join the Korean Volunteer Army to fight for a New Korean Republic.",b9a7c5be826c81db4a6b25d16c9ff72858539e81,True,False,,,,,0,1651812555,,0,{},i7inzyy,False,t3_uigw3g,False,True,t1_i7imfx7,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uigw3g/deterring_china_a_victory_denial_strategy_the/i7inzyy/,1651812568,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651783755.0,

I think my brother has a very pessimistic outlook on war - he looks at the Iraq war of a case where America “didn’t know” what they were doing and how they were drawing themselves into a quadmire - all based on lies about WMDs. Combine that with the stories of how a Cold War gone hot could have escalated out of control due to tactical nukes - and he is primed for a lot of conspiracy type content. 

He might, to put it quite simply, be confusing the exception for the rule. He is mixing up the mess that COIN was, versus the system of the US standing across a clearly defined border while lower profile or allied forces handle the fighting. He might be failing to see that the predicted conspiracies and disaster scenarios didn’t play out despite how much online personalities were certain they would happen - thus he doesn’t give it the proper skepticism and stoicism to it.

Everything we’ve seen indicates Russia knows a fight with NATO would be hard - but they mistakenly thought Ukraine would be a pushover. The United States underestimated the potential insurgency when they went into Iraq.

Your original claim was that ""Ukrainians (in effect, the US and it's NATO allies) struck ""in the early hours of a major attack"" to degrade their adversary's assets and consequently to retard their arranging ability.""

It is a bit disingenuous of you to make the claim you are making since you yourself are quoting my words, which run as follows: ""Ukrainians (in effect, the US and it's NATO allies) struck..."" While I am not about to get into a complicated discussion about the notion of ""agency"" in the context of the Ukranians, I'll be explicit about one thing: The Ukrainians without the backing of the US/NATO would not have been able to resist the Russians regardless of how the matter is considered and analysed. You are conveniently over looking the words in parenthesis, particularly the words ""*in effect*"".

&gt;Of course Ukraine would not still be going strong today had we not resupplied the with arms. But your original claim was that Ukraine had some major response ""in the early hours"" of Russia's invasion that played a major role in Russia's failed advance. A sustained defense is completely different than striking ""in the early hours of a major attack"".

Unless you are privy to some internal intelligence that proves the point to the contrary, there is no evidence to show that the Ukranians had the military wherewithal to resist the Russians. The reality is that Ukraine is not a military power of any consequence. Thus, what it has achieved till date (which is considerable) has only been possible because of some serious handholding by the US (and NATO). Further, you have to demonstrate - which you have not - that the Ukranians did not retaliate against the initial phase (""early hours"") of the Russian advance. This is borne out by the fact that the US was already warning of an imminent Russian attack *in public* so one can imagine the details of what the private Intel being shared with Ukraine would have been. Now your claim seems to be that the Ukrainians took this Intel and just sat back and allowed the Russians to attack then *only after* which they retaliated. You cannot prove this is what exactly happened. Moreover, assuming the intelligence being shared by the US with the Ukranians was actionable (which is a reasonable assumption), then it would have been wasted if they did not act on it. This does not mean going out to directly counter the Russian attacks or launching pre-emptive attacks (the last for a variety of reasons); it does, however, mean preparing the battlespace for the kind of battle they (the Ukrainians) wanted to fight which, to all intents and purposes, they seem to have succeeded in doing at least in the Kyiv and Kharkiv sectors. In this connection, I'd also like to clarify one point, which goes back to the question regarding ""agency"" of the Ukrainians - this is, in my view, a proxy war being fought by the US against Russia. Ukraine is the *casus belli*. This is not to say the US provoked it (though Prof. Mearsheimer, among others, seem to have a persuasive argument in this regard - I remain ambivalent about this for a number of reasons). Let's also be clear that this is not unknown in the US context. In this context, see my response to your last point below.

&gt;And this didn't begin happening until after Russia's plan and military equipment had fallen apart in the ""early hours of the major attack"". This falling apart was mostly of their own doing (or lack of doing in the case of maintenance). 

I get the impression that when people make this argument they have what seems to be an almost ideological axe to grind against the Russians. Justified or not, it does not further the analytical task on hand.

Of course, this does not absolve the Russians of what now appears to be bad planning,  faulty force employment modelling, questionable force structuring and, in many instances, poor equipment and maintenance levels, but it also does not fully explain why the Russians ""fell apart"". Pursing this line of argumentation leads one to not simply (justifiably or not) condemning the Russians, but also to either elide or undermine the depth and extent of combat capability that the US/NATO has infused within Ukraine. It also underplays the shadow role the US has been playing in that part of the world, and specifically in Ukraine.

&gt;Also you seem to equate Ukraine's defense with what the US and NATO would do against a major offensive (Russia/China)... but you never connect the dots there. I seriously doubt if US directly intervened against Russia or China our main strategy would essentially be a well equipped insurgency.

This, forgive me for putting it in this way, is nonsensical. You are imputing to me considerations that I have not stated or even gestured to and I consider that to be done in bad faith.

Let me again be very explicit: Ukraine would not have been able to withstand a Russian attack if it had not been for the US and NATO. This *does not* mean that the military action that we have seen the Ukrainians undertaking is what the US and NATO would do ""against a major offensive (Russia/China)"".

Further, your ""serious doubt"" about the US contending with a major power is also not borne out by history. As I mentioned above, the US fought the USSR precisely by means of a well-financed and well-armed insurgency. The most famous of these was the defeat and pullout of the Soviets from Afghanistan (but there were other numerous proxy wars happening in Africa and South America).",0e36e2b406735d04f0104f9b60f31cf9763f28dc,True,False,,,,,0,1651802991,,0,{},i7i6n4w,True,t3_uik9pj,False,True,t1_i7g3jqa,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uik9pj/assault_breaker_2_and_the_unfolding_events_in/i7i6n4w/,1651803003,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651774191.0,

Seriously. Back in 2014, I was the person who was saying that Russia's annexation of Crimea and Donbas separatism was a slam dunk. Because I assumed the idea was 'keep Ukraine out of NATO and the EU and screw anyone who lives there'. It puts Ukraine in a constant state of war that's damaging enough to constantly harm and disrupt the country and ruin any political stability while not being big enough to harm Russia. It keeps them in a constant border conflict that stops them from joining anyone. Just like with Georgia and Moldova. If they keep it in a frozen conflict for long enough, it could just fall back under their umbrella slowly sooner or later due to the (Russian engineered) failure to join with the west. They *already won*, but then decided to throw that out.

The fact that they invaded now confirms that the only plan is either to annex the whole place or to make it a puppet state. Cause they had already permanently stopped Ukraine from joining NATO and the EU. Now by invading they have given a possible method for Ukraine to join both.

[],False,,TheHuscarl,,,[],,,,text,t2_amv0e,False,False,"I get what Mearsheimer is saying here because it fits perfectly within his chosen interpretation of how neorealist international relations should work. The neorealist transaction happening in Ukraine is apparent. The US is working to balance the power of Russia via a coalition with Ukraine. Old school stuff. What Mearsheimer is worried about is that we are overbalancing, looking to deny Russia any power at all. In Mearsheimer's world view, this means that Russia is left with only one option: escalation and fighting, because that is the only way to ensure state survival (a powerless state cannot survive). In short, there is no ""golden bridge"" for Russia, only iron fences, so you just have to try and take down the fence. The thing is, I'm not sure how Mearsheimer squares this with the idea that Russia is a rational actor and that rational actors should not theoretically violate MAD. Regardless, he is worried that we will push Russia so far, threaten such a death blow, that the irrational will become the rational for the state. At least that's my read.   


Mearsheimer has (in strange opposition to his rhetoric re: China, basically that the US should fight them now and get it over with) for a long time pushed the case that the US is responsible for antagonizing Russia. Essentially that NATO has always been overbalancing and thus it has forced Russia into its aggressive posture. I think that is partly true and isn't something we should overlook. That said, I think in this case he is overstating the connection between a Russian loss in Ukraine and the ""destruction"" of Russia. As you yourself note, great powers have suffered defeats before and survived. The US has done this. Russia has done this.

&gt; I think initially the best the biden administration thought we could do in ukraine was to stymie the russian offensive by assisting the ukranians. But when it became clear that the Ukranians were doing very well on the battlefield against the russians we eventually escalated and eventually greatly escalated our goals and we are now bent on inflicting a decisive defeat on Russian.forces in Ukraine in other words beating them decisively on the battlefield and in addition wrecking the Russian economy with sanctions. And all of this is designed to greatly weaken Russian power - secretary of defense austin has made this very clear. And in fact one could argue that what he and his colleagues in the biden administration are interested in doing is knocking Russia out of the great power ranks.

&gt; I think, judy, this policy that the biden administration is following is remarkably dangerous and foolish. We know that the one circumstance in which a great power is likely to use nuclear weapons is when its survival is threatened - when it thinks a decisive defeat is being inflicted on it - and what the biden administration is bent on doing is inflicting a decisive defeat on russia. We are threatening its survival. We are presenting the russians with an existential threat. And this is again the one circumstance where they might use nuclear weapons - and I think we should be going to enormous lengths to make sure that we don't put them into a position where they even countenanceusing nuclear weapons - let alone use them.

He then continues to talk about the inability of the west to retaliate to a nuclear escalation but transcribing youtube videos on a phone is a pain I no longer wish to suffer

___

I've never taken Meirsheimer too seriously but I thought the goal of realist politics was at least a superficial basis in reality? Not only does he equivocate a decisive defeat with an existential threat without justification but he then goes on to say that we should capitulate to the whims of any nuclear state due to fears of escalation. I don't even agree with his characterisation of Russia as a great power and I can think of multiple examples of nuclear powers facing ""decisive defeats"" - and arguably even existential threats in in the collapse of the USSR - without escalating to even threats of a nuclear war.

So long as the military scope is contained within ukraine there is no reason to believe that the russian state faces an existential threat. It is possible that with the effect of sanctions that Putin's regime faces an existential threat without military success and that destabilization could result in unpredictable consequences for Russia's nuclear arsenal or a desperate decision to command generals to use nuclear weapons (although it is absolutely not certain that such orders would be followed and the international order is generally interested in maintaining the nuclear taboo in response).

So far the actions of the US have been perfectly sensible and seemingly haven't provoked any genuine risk of nuclear escalation. If Russia begins doing more than empty posturing only then will we have to decide (and quickly) what our response to their use should be.",5cbe0e70c4d500b1802c363e0d5cd0b7380b1f63,True,False,,,,,0,1651798698,,0,{},i7hxvku,False,t3_uivuq1,False,True,t3_uivuq1,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uivuq1/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_05_2022/i7hxvku/,1651798714,2,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651769898.0,

The list gets longer if you include weapons down to barely MTCR compliant ones like Kh-59 and P-800 Russia has been using. ATACMS/PrSM, SLAM-ER/GPS aided Harpoon, NSM, SM6, AARGM-ER/SiAW. In some cases US glide weapons may suffice(e.g. Odessa) yet Russia has no suitable equivalence. It's conceivable US can also tap into target drone and decoy production capacity or add propulsion to glide weapons for extra strike weapons in a relative short time if needed.",9df1bd86deec6a9d7e80ba4747aef19031d16014,True,False,,,,,0,1651797943,,0,{},i7hwjzi,False,t3_uivuq1,False,True,t1_i7hcund,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uivuq1/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_05_2022/i7hwjzi/,1651798032,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651769143.0,

As Japanese troops headed south from Taipei, [author James Davidson observed](https://books.google.com.tw/books/about/The_Island_of_Formosa_Past_and_Present.html?id=jAMxFLcYU4sC&amp;source=kp_book_description&amp;redir_esc=y):

&gt; The Chinese troops equipped with good weapons or bad, without drill, and unskilled in foreign tactics, protected by magnificent forts with big modern guns, or behind mudwalls with jingals, conducted themselves always with scarcely a redeeming feature. Their forces never advanced to make an attack unless they were confident that their position permitted of an easy retreat and that they greatly outnumbered their opponents. I know of hardly a single instance where, in the clearing, they have held their own against an approaching force, under anywhere near equal conditions. It is a usual manoeuvre for the Chinese to draw themselves up in mighty splendour on some open plot of ground in full view of the enemy, and should the latter advance towards them, to commence to fire off every available firearm, although they may be entirely out of range. This continues until the enemy has advanced sufficiently near to make his bullets felt in the Chinese ranks, and then there is a scatter and a scramble for a safer position, where their forces rally again to repeat the same tactics as before.

In short, the Chinese ran from the Japanese advance, and the Japanese even helped repatriate a bunch of them back to China aboard their ships.",2b3ecabcd0d69ff2c41feebf20d90d414c3bb958,True,False,,,,,0,1651797458,,0,{},i7hvrpz,False,t3_uigw3g,False,True,t1_i7gknfs,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uigw3g/deterring_china_a_victory_denial_strategy_the/i7hvrpz/,1651797471,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651768658.0,
