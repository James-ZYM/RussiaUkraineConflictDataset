Map of military actions in Ukraine by the evening of 05.03.2022

It was the calmest day since the start of the operation. Perhaps the silence regime had an impact.

The humanitarian corridor, through which no one was evacuated in the end, is on the map. Let's hope it comes in handy.

As for the hostilities, we note the fighting in the southwestern direction in the direction of Voznesensk-Pervomaysk, in which information about the use of landing troops by the Russian Army was confirmed.

In the southeastern direction, the Russian DNR forces are advancing northward, coming close to Gulyaypol.

The AFU Space Control Center in Velikodonskoye, Odesa Region, was destroyed by a point-blank strike.

In the west, the Russian Army is advancing towards Kiev, with many forces concentrated there. It is worth mentioning that both sides reported downed aircraft today. Judging by the columns of equipment in the video from Irpen, the city is under our control today.

&gt;The Finnish Democratic Republic (Finnish: Suomen kansanvaltainen tasavalta or Suomen kansantasavalta, Swedish: Demokratiska Republiken Finland, Russian: Финляндская Демократическая Республика), also known as the Terijoki Government (Finnish: Terijoen hallitus), was a short-lived puppet state of the Soviet Union in Finland from December 1939 to March 1940.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Finnish Democratic Republic was established by Joseph Stalin upon outbreak of the Winter War and headed by Otto Wille Kuusinen to govern Finland after Soviet conquest. The Finnish Democratic Republic was only recognised by the Soviet Union and nominally operated in Soviet-occupied areas of Finnish Karelia from the de facto capital of Terijoki. The Finnish Democratic Republic was portrayed by the Soviet Union as the official socialist government of Finland capable of restoring peace, but lost favor as the Soviets sought rapprochement with the Finnish Government. The Finnish Democratic Republic was dissolved upon signing of the Moscow Peace Treaty ending the Winter War and merged into the government of the Karelo-Finnish SSR.",a58e4b56dce33aaf0bd264c33db2bc86c11cf735,True,False,,,,,0,1646511491,,0,{},hzhp3f3,False,t3_t0cgvt,False,True,t1_hzafg01,/r/geopolitics/comments/t0cgvt/ukraine_megathread_all_new_posts_go_here_so_long/hzhp3f3/,1646511508,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646482691.0

[],False,,gvelion,,,[],,,,text,t2_118zdp,False,False,"&gt;Did you check the indictment of Slobodan Milosevic?

Here's what it says: ,, Beginning in late February 1998, the conflict intensified between the KLA on the one hand, and forces of the FRY and Serbia, on the other hand. A number of Kosovo Albanians and Kosovo Serbs were killed and wounded during this time. Forces of the FRY and Serbia engaged in a campaign of shelling predominantly Kosovo Albanian towns and villages, widespread destruction of property, and expulsions of the civilian population from areas in which the KLA was active. Many residents fled the territory as a result of the fighting and destruction or were forced to move to other areas within Kosovo. The United Nations estimates that by mid-October 1998, over 298,000 persons, roughly fifteen percent of the population, had been internally displaced within Kosovo or had left the province.  


In response to the intensifying conflict, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) passed Resolution 1160 in March 1998 ""condemning the use of excessive force by Serbian police forces against civilians and peaceful demonstrators in Kosovo,"" and imposed an arms embargo on the FRY. Six months later the UNSC passed Resolution 1199 (1998) which stated that ""the deterioration of the situation in Kosovo, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, constitutes a threat to peace and security in the region."" The Security Council demanded that all parties cease hostilities and that ""the security forces used for civilian repression"" be withdrawn.  


In an attempt to diffuse tensions in Kosovo, negotiations between Slobodan MILOSEVIC and representatives of NATO and the OSCE were conducted in October 1998. An ""Agreement on the OSCE Kosovo Verification Mission"" was signed on 16 October 1998. This agreement and the ""Clark-Naumann agreement,"" which was signed by Nikola SAINOVIC, provided for the partial withdrawal of forces of the FRY and Serbia from Kosovo, a limitation on the introduction of additional forces and equipment into the area, and the deployment of unarmed OSCE verifiers.  


Although scores of OSCE verifiers were deployed throughout Kosovo, hostilities continued. During this period, international verifiers and human rights organisations documented a number of killings of Kosovo Albanians. '' 

Also: ,, This joint criminal enterprise came into existence no later than October 1998 and continued throughout the time period when the crimes alleged in counts 1 to 5 of this indictment occurred: beginning on or about 1 January 1999 and continuing until 20 June 1999. '' 

NATO operation began only in March of 1999 !  Anyways, Milosevic clearly failed to prove his innocence at ICTY trial and was going to be convicted.

Russia is restoring its historical fullness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together – in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we had abandoned this, if we had allowed the temporary division to take hold for centuries, then we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.  
&gt;  
&gt;(...)  
&gt;  
&gt;This does not mean that its \[Ukraine's\] statehood will be liquidated, but it will be reorganized, re-established and returned to its natural state of part of the Russian world. In what borders, in what form will the alliance with Russia be fixed (through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus)? This will be decided after the end is put in the history of Ukraine as anti-Russia. In any case, the period of the split of the Russian people is coming to an end.  
And here begins the second dimension of the coming new era – it concerns Russia’s relations with the West. Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, acting in geopolitical terms as a single whole.  
&gt;  
&gt;(...)  
&gt;  
&gt;Because the construction of a new world order – and this is the third dimension of current events – is accelerating, and its contours are more and more clearly visible through the spreading cover of Anglo-Saxon globalization.  
A multipolar world has finally become a reality – the operation in Ukraine is not capable of rallying anyone but the West against Russia.  
Because the rest of the world sees and understands perfectly well – this is a conflict between Russia and the West, this is a response to the geopolitical expansion of the Atlanticists, this is Russia’s return of its historical space and its place in the world.  
China and India, Latin America and Africa, the Islamic world and Southeast Asia – no one believes that the West leads the world order, much less sets the rules of the game. Russia has not only challenged the West, it has shown that the era of Western global domination can be considered completely and finally over.  
The new world will be built by all civilizations and centers of power, naturally, together with the West (united or not) – but not on its terms and not according to its rules.

The media coverage of this disgusts me to no end. It's shown as entertainment. Actual human beings are dying. We need to get past the propaganda all sides are employing, drop our ideological biases, and get to the heart of the matter. This has to stop soon, because if Putin really plays his cards right, the US may be called to the carpet over eastern europe. 

Most of you will think I'm nuts here but understand that no one has really tested article five of the NATO charter. The US screams about our commitment to NATO, but do words matter all that much? An untested commitment is hollow. I have no doubt the US would defend western europe - but eastern europe is an entirely different matter. Part of the problem with NATO expansion is many of the countries brought in really aren't of strategic importance to the US. 

If this drags on, and Russia gets annoyed at NATO arming Ukraine, what happens if they decide to blow up arms coming from Estonia, killing NATO troops in the process? Suddenly the US is going to have to decide if it wants to risk strategic nuclear war over eastern europe. That's a dangerous play, but I doubt the US would do much. Invoking article five heavily implies the use of force, but if you read the text, force doesn't have to be on the table. If anything less than force comes up, our threat is hollow.

[],False,,J0Papa,,,[],,,,text,t2_n0tz6,False,False,"I was thinking about this a few days back - if there's one party that unambiguously benefits from the Russian-Ukrainian war, it's China.

Prior to the war 90% of the US foreign policy attention was focused on China. Focused on carving away potential allies, on trade wars, on troop deployments in the Pacific, on Taiwan diplomacy, so on. Now all attention and policy/decision making effort is directed towards Europe and China can do what they do best; quietly develop, continue to grow at enormous rates, and expand their influence and partnerships around the world without much noise. 

On top of that the Russian invasion - unprecedented since WWII - resulted in a total collapse in relations with the West. Everyday we see new sanctions, new exclusions, and more and more firms voluntarily leaving the country. Russian's aren't going to be able to buy a coke and catch a flight (even within Russia!) by the end of the month. Who will fill this void? The Chinese of course. Chinese cars, phones, computers, software, consumers goods, airlines, etc. An enormous new market for China where demand is sky-high and supply is 0 so you can charge what you please. 

We're probably a few weeks, maybe months, away from a significant oil and gas embargo on Russia (there's a ""voluntary"" one already) which again will play right into the Chinese hands. The Russians already built the pipelines into China at no cost to the Chinese... now its just a matter of the Chinese securing some ""strategy partnership"" where Russia will supply them oil and gas below market rates, because the Russians have no choice. 

The Chinese still have the same issues they had before (demographics, icy diplomacy with the West) but they are certainly in a better place now.",c1984639fd8acb3c08dbaa679754137632c1b39a,True,False,,,,,0,1646490653,,0,{},hzgdlwf,False,t3_t6xnna,False,True,t3_t6xnna,/r/geopolitics/comments/t6xnna/crisis_danger_and_opportunity_chinas_geopolitical/hzgdlwf/,1646490668,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646461853.0

My takeaway from it is China was played because Putin knows they won't ever admit they were played--that'd cause a massive loss of face, and everyone knows face is everything! This is doubly true since it's Xi's big year. So the CCP as the only party cannot come out and rectify the world's misperceptions and hand off governance to another party; it can only put in a lot of 'abstain' votes while screaming internally as the country's future crumbles.

I've always thought Chinese face-culture will be its downfall, and now we have self-strangulation via its zero-tolerance policy plus Putin's work of art. So now China is drowning in deep water, yet refusing to paddle because her makeup is ruined and she needs to cover her face.

Secondly - those are VVER reactors - those are quite widespread and structurally much safer than RBMK. Germany and Finland also operates VVER. Most important difference is negative void coefficient - left on its own, the chain reaction dies down - there must be a constant active intervention by the crew to keep the reaction going. And no, no matter what TV anchors say - nuclear reactors do not have some miraculous continent destroying capabilities. Spending one year in Fukushima gives you the same radiation dose as three years in Finland. Pripyat cemetery is about 20x Finland. Even if meltdown occurs, which it won't - we're talking about somewhat elevated radiation levels in a circle of 50 miles - not a civilization threatening event

Thirdly - people have no idea how sturdy concrete buildings are. It's really really difficult to do substantial damage to a solid concrete building even if one intentionally tries. There are still WW2 flak towers in Vienna and Berlin that nobody knows how to economically demolish. Look at the footage of Beirut explosion aftermath - much larger explosion than any non nuclear armaments we have - the grain silos right next to the epicenter still stand. And those are just grain silos - nobody builds grain silos to withstand explosions

Lastly, the blame goes both ways - Russian forces were not shooting there for fun and giggles, they were likely retaliating. Russian army had no business being there, but neither did Ukrainian. Nuclear power plants are supposed to be demilitarized.

NATO have been pushing their luck for years with Ukraine and refused to shift course from a) directly arming them and training their armed forces on Russia’s doorstep and b) committing to them joining NATO.

Of course this is all unacceptable to Russia, as it would be in an equivalent situation for the US, and Putin’s gone all in as a result.

I’m sure Putin would love to ‘conquer’ Ukraine but he can’t viably do that and he knows it. His realistic best case scenario (and basically what Russia is demanding) is that Ukraine does not join NATO, becomes a demilitarised buffer state, and that the Donbass, perhaps some more of the south and east if they’re lucky, breaks away and joins the Russian federation.

Russia don’t need their BTG’s to move they just need to get in position and to keep the supply lines open so that they can strengthen their negotiating position. If Ukraine doesn’t meet their demands they squeeze harder and demand a bit more. 

I am still extremely doubtful that Russia wants to ‘conquer’ all of Ukraine. Putin knows his popular support is limited to certain regions and Russia can’t afford a long protracted war against well armed insurgents.

They want to secure some key strategic regions in the east, they want guarantees that Ukraine will stop militarising and not join NATO.

China's poverty alleviation methods are diverse. Re-education is one of them and it  involves teaching people trade skills. In some villages the re-education camps also offered higher quality education for the children and so some parents even volunteer sending their kids in there. China in tackling poverty even relocates entire villages from unproductive areas.

I don't think your ""invest in their areas advice"" is something that is not happening.

Han chauvinism is actually illegal according to their constitution but it does  not mean it is not prevalent. The Party is working hard to end it. 

Your other claims about cultures as tourist attractions I won't dignify with a response. Frankly you only see the worst in your ideological rival.

As the years pass by (8 years now since this Uyghur story appeared) it seems there was a lot of exaggeration and mud-slinging from the west. I have given you reasons why China justifies the re-education camps. Their explanation make sense. It is probably the most humane action any country has taken in rehabilitating extremists. Muslim countries who usually also have similar issues may look to China as an example of successful deradicalisation. I agree that human rights and freedoms were constrained but not to the extent the west tries to claim and certainly there was no genocide or other brutal acts like sterilization. 

There are reasons to criticize China but we should not turn to lies, genocide is a serious issue if we throw that word around every  time it loses its meaning.

Zeihan posits that it's their final chance because their demographics have turned on them hard and they won't have enough people for this sort of operation in a decade, and definitely not enough ex-KGB expertise.

**OUTCOME OF THE WAR**

There are a lot of predictions on how the campaign is going to end.  Most predict a Russian victory followed by ensuing partisan warfare. Another possibility rarely mentioned is Ukraine can turn into one big Donbass region with trenches cutting across the entire country.  All the weapons NATO is providing Ukraine are defensive in nature (drones, anti-tank missiles, and anti-aircraft missiles. 

**RUSSIAN ECONOMY**

As I type the Ruble is USD$1=124 Ruble. Before the invasion, it was 75, and before Crimea, it was 45. If the war drags on, there will be increasing pressure on the ruble. 

Before the crisis, [the Russian reserve bank had enough reserves for 20 months of imports. Now it's most likely 10 months.](https://fortune.com/2022/03/03/when-will-russia-run-out-of-money-sanctions-ukraine-foreign-exchange-reserves-oil-gas/)

Here is what is happening on the oil and gas front

&gt;Actually completing those exports may be tough though. Already there are reports that international commodity trading firms are not finding buyers willing to take Russian crude oil, even at steep discounts. In one case, Russian oil was being offered at an unprecedented $18 per barrel discount to the benchmark price, and still there were no buyers. One big issue is that shipping companies that control the world’s oil tankers are refusing to load Russian crude. These companies fear inadvertently running afoul of financial sanctions, especially those around transacting business with some Russian banks, as well as the potential damage to their reputations if there’s public outcry over them helping Russia deliver its oil. So while there are no official sanctions on Russian energy exports yet, in practice Russia is finding it more difficult to move its oil and gas.

China thought Russia had an understanding to 'let sleeping dogs lie' while slowly chipping away at their power. Ukraine was Russia banging on a gong and now the dogs and even their aloof neighbors are not going back to sleep any time soon, to put it mildly. Nothing is as stimulating to the Europeans and others as the scenes of destruction straight from World War II and the collective memories they evoke. The leaders might have long understood the creeping dangers posed by the duo, but the populace were comfortably numb with their modern pleasures. Putin basically handed democratic leaders carte blanche to deal with the duo and they aren't going to let it go to waste. 

&gt;The main challenge is how to slowly transition from the US having a qualitatively unique role, with special responsibilities and rights derived from more than just its size and contribution, to something more like just another order member who contributes a lot more due to its wealth. 

I think having a party whip for the world is beneficial, especially because she's uniquely experienced. Not saying she should be towering above the rest, though that's usually how things end up in our fractal universe. The US' unique geography and growth potential affords it a good opportunity to be the 1% of the world. (Not a fervent supporter of the US; just calling things as I see them)

Other thoughts while writing this:

Putin couldn't have been ignorant of the consequences of invading. He may have underestimated the speed and strength of the response, but invading one of Europe's largest countries is bound to provoke some major response. If China comes to believe it has been betrayed, would it go about exacting revenge on Putin? If so, how? This might come across as fantasy-speak to some, but consider how this move affects Xi:

Another respected commentator, /u/Weilim, has an interesting take where he sees China's current nightmare as Xi's personal failing after getting too personally cozy with Putin, and this is causing rifts evidenced by the disconnect between the ministries overseeing propaganda and diplomacy. There are also reports that major Chinese banks are openly calling Ukraine an invasion, contrary to the party line. The Chinese leadership are not happy. I think this, combined with other domestic issues like the increasingly-unsustainable zero-tolerance policy, might create enough discontent to jeopardize Xi's historic third term, set to be renewed later this year. But the 'smiling tiger' probably isn't going down without a fight, so on top of the nightmarish foreign policy situation, the Ukraine invasion might renew factional strife within China at a terribly inopportune moment.",58441e25c6c3ccee9a2b2d39ddc8be2017b038ce,True,False,,,,,0,1646460379,,0,{},hzf6cop,True,t3_t6xnna,False,True,t1_hzex7f7,/r/geopolitics/comments/t6xnna/crisis_danger_and_opportunity_chinas_geopolitical/hzf6cop/,1646460393,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646431579.0

What matters now is further decoupling from China, and continuing to trade efficiency for robustness in supply chains. At the same time, Taiwan's defense must be increased such that the CCP always doubt whether it can be taken. 

I've always felt that the West's true power was massively underrated. And that everyone would get a lot more scared when they were forced into looking into the abyss of actually losing the liberal international order (LIO). The Russia conflict did that, and look what it did to Germany. Talk about a cold bucket of water as a wakeup. Whatever German voters are thinking, the more sophisticated politicians are seeing that the real danger is not Russia, but the order itself breaking down.

Still, the LIO faces serious political and technical challenges if it is going to retool itself into something sustainable for the future: a truly global order once Russia and China are dealt with. The main challenge is how to slowly transition from the US having a qualitatively unique role, with special responsibilities and rights derived from more than just its size and contribution, to something more like just another order member who contributes a lot more due to its wealth. This will take time. 

But the order needs to get to a place where the US is sharing burdens with others more fairly, and thus decision making more fairly. Eventually, we need to get to a place where we can say with certainty that any nation with proven LIO principles can become the most powerful nation, eclipsing the US, so long as that nation plays by the rules.

&gt; I contested your assumption that ruling out NATO membership would be a green light for Putin to roll in the tanks. You doubled down on this at the very end with ""why wouldn't he?"" But based on what you wrote above, you answered your own rhetorical question: ""if they never get into NATO, Putin has zero to worry about in terms of security.""

The assumes that the *only* reason that Putin would have to invade is that he is so very afraid of Ukraine entering a defensive alliance. I think once a defensive alliance is completely off the table there are many reasons that Putin would prefer to have a government if his choosing in the Ukraine. And so, why wouldn’t he? 

&gt; Your argument seems to be that
&gt; if we are never sending troops to Ukraine (my claim which you may or may ont agree with),
&gt; then there is no need (for anyone) to negotiate any concessions,
&gt; therefore we should not explicitly rule out Ukraine in NATO.
&gt; I don't think your conclusion follows from the preceding points. I'd argue that if we are never sending troops to Ukraine, then there is no point in falsely misleading the Ukrainians to think that they'll ever get in. So why not agree to this in exchange for Russian concessions 

Because I can’t think of any concessions that Russia could make that would assure Ukrainian sovereignty.

&gt; Suppose for now that there exist some (undefined) Russian concessions. You would only say no to this compromise if...you still held out the possibility of admitting Ukraine sometime in the distant future. Do you?

So are you starting from the premise that Ukraine is a client state of Russia, and we should just go ahead and acknowledge that in exchange for....something?

It just clicked for me....there was a few missing ingredients to the Russian invasion that didn't make sense to me. Now it does.

They moved their BTGs into positions to control maximum territory, patiently waiting for encircled cities to fall, and one by one they are.

But the BTGs moved cautiously, very exposed, because Russia concentrates (like the Spartans) on providing a backbone to a larger army. But they do not concentrate on being the larger army.

BTGs are largely static forces, heavily defended, hard to move, and with a long, long, deadly reach.

Now that they are emplaced how do they ""move""? Paramilitaries.

Now that they control the flow of food and supplies...and certain cities see defeat is inevitable. It's not a big jump to conclude that Russia will raise paramilitary armies from the conquered cities.

This adds legitimacy to their invasion.
