The MQ adds semi-survivable tanking capability organically to the carrier air wing without taking a combat-coded airframe or pilot out of the fight like buddy tanking does. That's a huge deal. In peacetime that means cheaper maintenance and less wasted airframe life on the fast jets. In wartime that means longer strike ranges (outranging an enemy is the best defensive capability a carrier has) and more strikes prosecuted.

(Keep in mind that directly comparing it to the Hornet as far as buddy tanking goes, those numbers you quote are somewhat misleading- the MQ delivers 16k lbs fuel to 500nmi away, while the SH takes off with 14k lb and goes down from there.)",202ceddaeffa82d7b768d667512ce4f9758109fb,True,False,,,,,0,1646524043,,0,{},hzigs0p,False,t3_t7j813,False,True,t3_t7j813,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t7j813/do_i_not_understand_how_tanker_operations_work_or/hzigs0p/,1646524060,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646495243.0,

Now let's also assume that same military alliance altruistically comes to the defense of **any** country in a defensive war. 

From a realpolitik standpoint, why would anyone join that alliance? They'll help you and you don't have to contribute anything.


Sweden and Finland have made a conscious decision not to join NATO despite being eligible for membership for decades. The Baltic states, on the other hand, immediately started seeking NATO accession: independence from the USSR in late 1991, feelers out a few years later, lobbying NATO members in the mid-90s, improving democracy and market economies until inclusion in 2004. The Baltics rebuked Russian offers of military alliance. Countries in the region have had 30 years of post-Soviet politics in which to seek membership in the EU or NATO and to generate an informed populace with developed market economies and democratic institutions. (And several former Warsaw Pact members did.) NATO has no obligation to states which haven't sought membership.

I'm not saying NATO members shouldn't help Ukraine. It's in their interest and the interest of democracies around the world to aid against an expansionist, authoritarian state. But, from a realpolitik standpoint, individual states are responsible for seeking membership. It's not NATO's mission to be the world's police.

Sure, hypothetically, the US or France might not honor its NATO obligations to an attacked member state. (Just as hypothetically, China could attempt to integrate Taiwan and kill Americans defending Taiwanese and lead to other disputes about defensive responsibilities among member states.) But that doesn't match with the alliance's rhetoric or its past actions in the handful of instances where a member state has been affected by an outside actor. In those few instances, the other members have acted in response. (And, in a democratic country, the leader's failure to act is going to create pushback. Just like Trump received from both parties, some more energetic than others.)",f81c8d9d8737a8de6b3191bd904ae630591891d0,True,False,,,,,0,1646521636,,0,{},hzibk69,False,t3_t7bz9h,False,True,t1_hzho9m6,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t7bz9h/are_there_options_for_western_counterescalation/hzibk69/,1646521653,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646492836.0,

Putin is at his weakest position in years. Seems his calculus was that the young, weak government in Kyiv would roll over and the Ukraine wouldn't put up a fight. He severely misjudged the patriotism of the Ukrainian people and the unity of the western powers.

Again, escalation conventionally is concerning but one up escalation and parallel escalation are both choices that can be made and the burden of de-escalation isn't just from our side. In addition, the choice to escalate vertically isn't just a matter of military strategy anymore. The optics, political consequences etc of vertical escalation ought to be bore by the party that chose to escalate.

Russia chose to escalate from little green men to full out invasion. We respond with sending arms and said hypothetical no fly zone.

We can keep en eye on border SAM and air defense assets on the border while we maintain a no fly zone. Russian jets are going to try and challenge this zone and we will shoot them down. Russian AA will be on the ground trying to shoot us down too. These actions and reactions are parallel escalations. We don't have to escalate. They can choose not to either. 

Whether or not Belerusian SAM sites will be shooting at American planes isn't necessarily a given because doing so is a consideration of both strategy and policy and again, you can either choose to accept the zone and fight from within the borders of Ukraine or you can make it worse by trying to escalate. If you shoot at American planes that aren't flying in Belarusian airspace, then you can expect to suffer the consequences of your escalation.

Sure. We might very well escalate to attacking NATO airbases and then a NATO - Russian war. But every single step of the way, that escalation has to be a combination of military and political choices. I guess what I'm trying to get at is that the whole point of a strong military response is to use the political and military consequences of a defensive war (like a no-fly-zone) to force the opponent onto the negotiation table. 

As long as you leave enough leeway on the negotiation table, both sides will eventually be forced to stop unless you risk losing everything you paid so much to gain in this war. As Putin should know that Russia can in no way win a war attacking NATO and that's the absolute last thing Putin would want to do if he wants to win anything for how much he lost in Ukraine so far.

**This is a hypothetical exploration of what might happen during escalation. It's terrifying to think about how it can escalate but you must realize that escalation in warfare isn't always a uncontrolled spiral. It has to be a choice and each choice isn't just based on battlefield reality. It will also be based on the political reality around the battlefield.**

But when you're over-matched in a conventional conflict, there comes a point when you have to ask what the end goal of your resistance actually is. Is it to remove Russian forces from your soil? Is it to preserve the sovereignty of the state? To preserve the lives of Ukrainians? All of the above? If you weigh the costs and gains at first it seems like a no-brainer: you resist or you die. Right? But this isn't, y'know, Terminator Salvation or something like that. It's more complex than a matter of survival. You have to resist for a *reason*. Just resisting for the sake of it is not helpful; there has to be a strategic design to your resistance.

Part of the problem is of course that no-one knows quite how far the Russian state is willing to go with regards to the conquest of Ukraine. My personal opinion is that they're willing to go balls to the wall over this because Ukraine is not some faraway state with a foreign peoples but a country right on the Russian border, a country which decided to enshrine the concept of joining NATO - Russia's mortal enemy - in its constitution, with little apparent desire to reverse that decision. As for the mathematics of occupation...eh...I think they could do it, just about, by rotating forces through the theatre. They might have to increase their military budget and personnel numbers to do it, but it's possible.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I do agree thoroughly with that worrying uncertainty of Russia's economic situation. It's already bad, and it's only getting worse. I think you make a very good point about them potentially treating the sanctions as an act of war, but honestly, how do they respond? Nukes? And if they'll nuke over that, then why are we wasting our time with the sanctions?

What else could they respond with? They know they're conventionally out-matched by NATO on every possible front. If it really comes down to it, their only hope of avoiding a complete collapse is to invite the prospect of a nuclear confrontation. There is discussion at length elsewhere about the prospect of Putin taking his toys and going home but the general consensus seems universal at this point: such an act would be suicidal for him, certainly politically suicidal if not in a very real sense. 

So if withdrawal is suicidal and leaves his enemies intact, what's the upside for him? There clearly isn't one, whereas by raising the prospect of nukes being launched, he can at least try to get the West to stand down, and if they don't then it becomes suicide without leaving your enemies intact. A brutal, ruthless calculation yes, but that's the mind of an autocrat for you.

I honestly couldn't tell you why we're wasting our time with sanctions. My guess is that Western politicians have managed to convince themselves that there's a group of people in Russia somewhere who, once the economy gets bad enough and the rioting starts, not only have the balls to take on Putin but also would offer to stand down and withdraw from Ukraine if they were in power. I can't really see them getting that far without coming up against the wrong kind of opposition but right now it's the only reason I can think of for this crushing sanctions regime.",f7b57bf4d35dfbe2726ae9e627ad294273cc3176,True,False,,,,,0,1646516649,,0,{},hzi0nzi,False,t3_t6mn73,False,True,t1_hzhshgp,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t6mn73/what_happens_after_a_discussion_on_the_potential/hzi0nzi/,1646516662,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646487849.0,

Here's a half-baked example of a more realistic escalation that NATO/the EU could make, modelled on the Berlin Airlift. 

* Assert Ukrainian sovereignty and its right to have international flights take off and land peacefully. And fly in humanitarian aid and aid workers, and press, and fly out refugees and wounded soldiers. 
* Use either military cargo aircraft or military pilots and leased civilian cargo aircraft, but don't send any escort fighters. 
* Reserve your right to include military aid on the flights in the future, but promise not to do it for now. Invite Russian inspectors to ride along. If Russia does some terrible thing in the future, you can kick out the inspectors as a mild escalation that opens the door to military aid, but Russia still has to risk shooting down a plane full of aid workers and food if they want to escalate in turn. 
* Fly not just into Ukrainian airports, but also make overflights from Poland to Turkey, etc. over Ukrainian territory at variable altitudes. 

This is an escalation that does include risk. Russia could shoot down those planes. And then NATO/the EU would have to decide what to do. But NATO would have the flexibility to decide whether, when, and how to escalate in that instance. It's not like a no-fly where you *have* to shoot down the other guy's planes and then you're off the atomic races. 

You have the carrot of further deescalation and relieving sanctions, as well as the stick of including military aid on the flights, and of course the risk of escalation if Russia decides to shoot down a plane. 

Russia would have to shoot down unarmed foreign aircraft carrying humanitarian aid and wounded people making completely legal flights. Because the flight paths would vary, Russia would probably have to curtail their use of SAMs and use fighters to visually identify targets and deconflict airspace which would tie up resources. It would buy the Ukrainian air force some breathing room, and begin a process of asserting that there are limits and rights that Russia infringes at its own risk, and that NATO refuses to be pushed around in its own backyard.

You don’t just say, “That’s a no fly zone.” You have to enforce a no-fly zone, which means you have to be willing to use force against those who break the no-fly zone. The second thing, which nobody understands, is if you put a no-fly zone in the eastern part of Ukraine, for instance, and we’re going to fly coalition or NATO aircraft into that no-fly zone, then we have to take out all the weapons that can fire into our no-fly zone and cause harm to our aircraft. So that means bombing enemy radars and missile systems on the other side of the border. And you know what that means, right? That is tantamount to war. So if we’re going to declare a no-fly zone, we have to take down the enemy’s capability to fire into and affect our no-fly zone. And few understand that. And that’s why, if you talk about a no-fly zone, it is a very sober decision because many in the world would interpret it as an act of war.

Maybe... But if I were Estonia, or Russia, right now I wouldn't be very convinced of that.

That's the trillion dollar question, isn't it? In a way, it's NATO's own fault for expanding the alliance to so many nations - to so many security *consumers* rather than security *producers* \- that any one nuclear-armed member state now has to ask themselves how many cities they're willing to trade, presumably in exchange for ostensibly defending the sovereign soil of a country whom a large number of their domestic constituents may very well never have heard of.

I've personally always believed that NATO should have disbanded after the fall of the Soviet Union and been replaced by a smaller, primarily European-dominated organisation consisting of Europe's ""Big Seven"": GBR, FRA, GER, ITA, ESP, POL and RUS. Yes I said RUS as in Russia; incorporating Russia into the wider European security apparatus should've been the absolute number one strategic priority after the death of the USSR. Such a position would've foregone every security concern we've had about Russia in the past two decades. Unfortunately, the political servants at the time were not as astute as I am at geopolitical analysis.

But do you know what the real rub of the meat is? Even if it had been a ""Big Six"" which excluded Russia, in this parallel timeline instead of expanding the alliance and forcing an immediate strategic calculation at the point of conflict, they could have given security guarantees as and when required. It would have avoided entirely the prospect of Russia - or any other nemesis for that matter - being able to climb the escalation ladder in a way that is detrimental to the alliance's capacity to take action when required without fear of entering a nuclear conflict, as is now unfolding in Eastern Europe.",0c0a64be9d3c73ebe8b1c1b71f422d4f3455100a,True,False,,,,,0,1646514301,,0,{},hzhvf8c,False,t3_t7bz9h,False,True,t1_hzh2v1a,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t7bz9h/are_there_options_for_western_counterescalation/hzhvf8c/,1646514316,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646485501.0,

I don’t have time to make an exhaustive (or really even adequate) reply, but there are a lot of interconnected reasons. I’ll touch in a few but the meat of the issue comes after the bullet points.

* Like it or not, we are in multiple alliances which provide mutual security guarantees. Putin has stated objectives - restoration of the historic Russian empire basically - which will, if he continues, trigger those agreements and draw us into a war (or into a massive breach of faith). If Putin remains determined on this course and retains the ability to advance it, we will at some point be faced with a war at a time and in a place of his choosing. Allowing Putin to succeed here due to his nuclear threats also fails to deter China from attacking Taiwan, and encourages proliferation of nuclear weapon capability in that it would become clear the US could be intimidated into inaction by nukes.

* we are in these alliances partly for ideological reasons but also for economic reasons. The nations we are allied with are vital trade partners. (I’m counting EU as a single entity here.) Failure to protect them harms us. 

* We have failed to become independent of fossil fuels, and Russia is in a position geographically to threaten many supplies of these. (We shoulda listened to President Carter, but it’s - maybe - not too late to get our asses in gear here.) 

But most crucially, events of the last several years amply demonstrate that Putin’s Russia is able and willing to engage in broad-spectrum information warfare against its rivals, including the US. That presented as recently as 14 months ago an existential threat to our Constitution, democratic republic, and rule of law.  

We might choose to become isolationist militarily or economically, but information isolationism goes against the strongest of our cultural values and norms. This makes us continually vulnerable to the kind of information warfare Putin *has already perpetrated upon us.* His willingness to use both state means and the resources of the Russian kleptocrats to undermine us have produced clear harms here; it’s not unreasonable to think that hundreds of thousands of coronavirus deaths were preventable absent these information operations over the last decade. 

If Putin maintains this capability, he clearly will use it again in the future. Destroying the US republic as a functioning entity on the world stage is not Putin’s goal, but that **is** a necessary steppingstone to his actual goals. 

The US has many problems, but letting **that** chowderhead bait us into destroying ourselves is unacceptable in my book. 

It is reasonable (though I think odious) to take the view that Ukraine’s political status itself is perhaps not our problem. 

**However**, pragmatically this is a generational opportunity to catch Russia with its pants down and pull Putin’s fangs.

Just because we got lucky in the past with cuban missile crisis and stanislav Petrov does not mean we should roll the dice.

I think you're right and they aren't exactly eager. But here's the supremely ironic twist of the matter: NATO has not given them a choice. The alliance has consistently improved its military forces for decades and everybody with any knowledge of the matter is well aware of the immense conventional over-match NATO has against Russia. Why would you, as a Russian general, knowing your country's fate hinges on stopping NATO formations from penetrating deep into your territory, even bother to try stopping them conventionally? If you're a smart cookie then you simply wouldn't, you would request WRA for nuclear strikes and focus on enacting post-strike plans.

Yeah, I know, MAD and all that. But I personally don't fundamentally believe in deterrence theory and in fact quite frankly I believe its a failed theory for the simple reason that there have been far, *far* more conflicts throughout history where deterrence failed to prevent nations and peoples from waging war against one another even when conventionally out-matched.

[],False,,Xyzzyzzyzzy,,,[],,,,text,t2_6qgej2g0,False,False,"One of the reasons you don't see much media touting Russian successes is because of the two sides' asymmetric media strategies, especially early on.

From the very beginning, Ukraine decided to wage a very public war, touting its forces' successes on social media. This serves several purposes: increasing morale among Ukrainian troops, building a common set of national myths (""Ghost of Kiev"", etc.), pressuring western governments to provide significant aid, building support among NATO/EU populations for the Ukrainian side, and publishing information which might tend to reduce the morale of Russian troops and people. At the same time, Ukraine seems to have exercised a remarkable degree of control over what footage is released on social media; few images or videos of Ukrainian positions or Ukrainian losses have been published.

Russia, however, almost entirely refrained from releasing any sort of war footage, because the Russian government wanted to promote the idea that there wasn't even a war at all - just a police action, a ""special operation"" in which a small group of Ukrainian Nazis was brought to justice. So the Russian side basically conceded the international and social media space to Ukraine.

So the media landscape has been one in which Ukrainian victories are preferentially published and spread, and where Russian victories are more rarely published.

That means that no, there's no accurate source for victories that Russia has accomplished in Ukraine. There's no truly *accurate* source for anything, but there's even fewer sources describing the battlefield from the Russian perspective. The closest thing we have to accurate sourcing is OSINT folks compiling lists of verified Russian equipment losses gleaned from videos shared by social media. (And even then, it wouldn't surprise me if the Ukrainians have slipped in some ""extra"" losses; I'd consider it malpractice if they don't have at least one small team of folks armed with spray paint, stencils, and a guide to Russian military markings.)",10e1eca150a1c37bfdb797aad681464fa5008d5d,True,False,,,,,0,1646511756,,0,{},hzhpp21,False,t3_t7alau,False,True,t3_t7alau,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t7alau/are_there_any_accurate_sources_for_victories_the/hzhpp21/,1646511775,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646482956.0,

1. Agreed, the west needs to draw more lines in the sand. Things like ""Once we're talking to a country about NATO protection, they are effectively a member and get NATO protection until the talks end""
2. That would come under the ""lines in the sand"" too - I don't think the west can necessarily extend protection to every country, and those already in Russian influence are probably too far (Khazakstan/Uzbekistan etc), but Taiwan etc can be given stronger protections. The question is countries like Georgia, Azerbaijan.
3. I completely disagree - the entire reason Russia can do this is that Ukraine is not in NATO. In the same way that the west doesn't dare interfere in Ukraine, Russia wouldn't dare attack a NATO member
4. As above, this is different for NATO members. The West would, I truly believe, defend the Baltics/Poland etc. Russia will be the one who decides if things go nuclear, but at that point it only takes **one** of France/US/UK to respond in kind and Russia's cities are gone
5. We haven't taken conventional forces off the table overall, we've taken them off the table in Ukraine. That's not the same thing. You're essentially advocating for ""testing"" Russian escalation, but the simple fact is that Ukraine is not in NATO, and the rules of ""the game"" is that Russia doesn't attack NATO.

There is no way for NATO to escalate in conventional forces without risking Russia escalating to nuclear weapons.

A lot of people are optimistic that some kind of insurgency could persist and may even have the opportunity to effect strategic consequences on a puppet regime but I cannot see this happening. Ukraine doesn't have a warlike culture demanding sacrifice in the name of one cause or another, as Vietnam and the Taliban did, and more importantly they don't have the fertility rate to sustain the persistent attrition a guerrilla war demands. Even before the invasion they had poor demographics but with the headlong flight of a few hundred-thousand civilians - likely soon to become millions - to neighbouring countries, this will have gotten considerably worse.

They're also equally optimistic about Putin being overthrown or the Russian army collapsing, Nivelle offensive-style, but I believe these are extreme scenarios which would only occur in extreme circumstances and are in any case best avoided for the simple reason that either one could trigger a nuclear conflict. Whatever Putin's attitude towards the West, he is at this point the devil we know better than some ultra-nationalist general who thinks Russia should've nuked NATO twenty years ago.

What is of most concern to me right now is how far NATO and the organisation's allies intend to crush Russia's economy. It's important to recognise that there is no precedent for this; not even Weimar Germany in 1919, which had for the previous five years laid waste to some of France's most valuable economic nexuses, was subject to the kind of economic assault that has begun against Russia. And so without precedent we have no idea how far Russia will submit to being besieged.

&gt; The fact that Ukraine isn't a NATO member is a wonderful fig leaf right now.

However, look at what the European nations' leaders and population seem to think about it: [Sweden](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/majority-swedes-favour-joining-nato-poll-2022-03-04/), [Finland](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/finnish-leader-meets-biden-weighs-nato-war-deepens-83258257). Nations that used to be meh about joining NATO are now far more into signing up. They wouldn't be doing that if they thought Western promises of mutual defense were worthless - they'd be seeking to cozy up to Moscow instead, or maybe building their own nukes.

Part of the reason why NATO membership is important is that it's a *mutual* defense pact, not a ""America will bail you out if the Russians get frisky"" pact. When you join, you are also committing yourself to integrate with the NATO militaries and come to the defense of any other country in the alliance that is attacked. Would Ukraine commit major forces to a war if it was, say, Greece that was attacked?

A lukewarm response to Ukrainian pleas makes the statement that NATO membership is important and meaningful. It says, join up and shoulder the full commitment and obligations, or figure out your own way to deal with the Russians. It makes the world more predictable to the Putins of the world. Attack a full NATO member, and the weight of the world will come down upon you. Attack a non-member, and meh. A little more predictability is good in a world that's still chock-full of nuclear weapons.

And that's why you use a single axis of advance. and don't bother with sieging.

Every moderately-sized city on earth, except for a handful, has a river running through the middle of it. Sieging of the city involves making 2 bridges over the river and support an extended line over those 2 bridges. Unless you are the Red Army in 1944 fighting the Germans, don't do it.

[],False,,Illustrious-Lab-8324,,,[],,,,text,t2_7dmd3bek,False,False,"Think about it like this. The ""Ukraine isn't a member of NATO"" argument posits that there is essentially a toggle with only two settings. A complete guarantee of absolute protection, regardless of the consequences on the one hand, and a complete abdication of responsibility on the other. Two settings — 0 and 100. (We can argue about whether supplying weapons to Ukraine means there's a setting above 0, but clearly it comes with no guarantees.) 

This logic made sense in the Cold War, where the only countries in Europe who weren't members of NATO were members of the Warsaw Pact, or were neutral. Or were Yugoslavia. And the reason for the toggle switch made sense too. We wanted to make it absolutely crystal clear that we were unified against any Soviet adventurism whatsoever, and formalize our shared interest in absolute ideological and political resistance to Soviet Communist domination. 

Today, many of the countries that were in the Warsaw Pact are now members of NATO, some countries (like Ukraine) that should arguably be a part of NATO aren't, and instead of an implacable Soviet Union, we have a Russia that supplies half of Europes oil and gas, and buys our iPhones and fast food. 

The invasion of Ukraine is testing the logic of NATO in the post-Cold War world. In 1982, West Germany was terrified of the USSR and absolutely wanted its fortunes tied to those of its neighbors. In 2022, Germany isn't afraid that Putin is going to invade it. It wants to buy Putin's natural gas. The US's interest in keeping *Eastern* Europe free from Russian domination is far smaller than our interest in keeping US gasoline prices low. 

The question is, regardless of what is printed on paper, do NATO nations still really see their interests accurately reflected in their treaty obligations, especially when it might escalate into a nuclear exchange? I would argue the answer is probably no. 

And if that's the case then it would actually strengthen NATO if they introduced some ""intermediate settings"" to that toggle switch. If instead of going from 0 straight to 100, there were some places in between that allowed NATO to take action that more accurately maps to its interests. 

A limited military escalation in Ukraine *could, maybe* do that by allowing NATO to advance its overall goal of deterring Russia without waiting until Russia attacks a NATO member state, and tests the member nations' actual commitment to their Article 5 obligations. In other words, however risky it is to intervene in Ukraine (where NATO can always walk away if things go south) it is much riskier to invite an attack on a member state, where NATO members are compelled to take the fight all the way to nuclear armageddon, no matter how peripheral the fight is to their national interest. Or allow NATO to crumble when push comes to shove. 

Again, not saying that NATO should necessarily intervene in Ukraine. Just saying that there is a more complex balancing of interests than I think some people are acknowledging.",f7682a7e4026a129495e779319d2e5ef03600aa0,True,False,,,,,0,1646508885,,0,{},hzhjbe4,True,t3_t7bz9h,False,True,t1_hzhab4v,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t7bz9h/are_there_options_for_western_counterescalation/hzhjbe4/,1646508901,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646480085.0,True

But the underlying lesson is that we're not willing to risk nuclear war to protect a liberal-ish European democracy of 44 million people. If you are (much smaller) Estonia or Slovenia or Poland, I imagine you are looking at that wrenching, unsentimental calculus and wondering how much protection a piece of paper a bunch of long-gone Prime Ministers once signed in Brussels really buys you. This has always been true of mutual defense pacts, but this is a very public, very obvious stress test.

I really don't see how this follows at all. Ukraine was not considered particularly liberal or western 2 weeks ago (including by actual Ukranians), and it's also obviously not a NATO member. Suggesting otherwise is just revisionism.

Exactly. However, let me remind you that both Russia and the USA mutually agreed to let non-proliferation treaties lapses. Despite the conflict in Ukraine, there is cooperation that can still be done: space (Soyuz just took an American astronaut from the ISS) and anti-proliferation.

&gt;Similarly, it encourages adventurism. Taiwan, Kashmir, Moldova, the line of control — while you might face heavier than expected resistance, sanctions, and an insurgency — clearly if you've got nukes, you can get away with it if you really want to.

Is it, though? The war hasn't ended yet. 

&gt;If you are (much smaller) Estonia or Slovenia or Poland, I imagine you are looking at that wrenching, unsentimental calculus and wondering how much protection a piece of paper a bunch of long-gone Prime Ministers once signed in Brussels really buys you. This has always been true of mutual defense pacts, but this is a very public, very obvious stress test.

If it makes you any happier, let me tell you my suggestion on what people should do. France, the United Kingdom, and the United States should, when it happened, immediately launch nuclear weapons at Moscow and/or every other cities that Putin and his oligarchs can be hiding. However, before the President of the France Fifth Republic, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and the President of the United States should get on national television, national radio, and every possible Internet social media channel and explain precisely to their citizens what exact nuclear war means. The only person required to authorised a nuclear strike is the Commander-in-Chief. They they don't immediately got shot by their respective bodyguards, well, let's go. Now, personally, I live in a country unlikely to catch an ICBM, so there's that.

&gt;However Putin (and frankly his generals) have to be ready and willing to take that huge step of employing nuclear weapons — with all of the same attendant risks we are afraid of — at some point down the line. There is no reason to believe at this point that Putin/Russian generals are any more eager to do that than we are. But we are acting as if they are without testing it on the battlefield.

Everyone who talk about this without significant interaction with the Russian military is full of crap, including you. Among countries that are allied/friendly with the West, India is the one with significant experience interacting with the Russian military. They had the most experience of anyone else in the world in taking pot shots at another nuclear-armed state, Pakistan. So before you actually talk about also taking pot shots at Russia using conventional weapons with a nuclear-armed state, at least listen to [Indian generals who had more experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNHUDDqTgdI).

To pre-empt your criticism of India: it is the largest democracy in the world. 

&gt;If we start seeing video of Russia indiscriminately leveling cities or lining up all the men, women, and children in a town and executing them as punishment for an insurgent attack, are there limited military responses that we should consider, if not for moral reasons, then to maintain the credibility of our conventional forces as a deterrent

\-Export of conventional weapons systems

\- Foreign volunteers

\- Sanctions

\- Closing own airspace and Turkish Straight

\- Cyberattacks

In my mind, the question is, how far can we push these tactics.  Europe seems to have demurred on the shipment of heavy armour and fighter jets. (The true scope of their contributions is unknown). I would argue that we give the Ukrainians every conventional weapon that will integrate with their forces easily.

How far can we push the foreign volunteers side of things?

Right now, we are, arguably, risking thecredibility of that deterrent by making it clear to Russia that as longas they have nukes, we won't stand in their way.

This is something I've been asking people who don't agree with a no-fly-zone or any intervention.

If people feel like intervention = nuclear war then fine I don't particularly care about *what* the response is as long as we get it across loud and clear that you can't just use our aversion to escalate to nuclear war to do what you please.

And once again, how would we address something like the Cuban Missile Crisis today? Sure, the Cuban Missile Crisis wasn't a shooting war, but we had to walk the nuclear line to make it clear (to each other really) that either we annihilate each other, or we go back to the negotiation table. If we said ""oh sending in conventional naval forces will lead to escalation beyond our control"" then congrats. We now have nukes within swimming distance of the U.S.

I'm also of the opinion that now that the consequences of nuclear war is abundantly clear, the only reason I can any country going with the nuclear option as the next step is if they've lost a war that will make them cease to exist as a country. A nuclear option is the last resort to take your invader/enemy with you. Otherwise, whatever goal you want to achieve on the battlefield away from home using nukes is generally achievable using conventional forces.

Losing planes against a defensive perimeter like a no-fly-zone really doesn't warrant a nuclear weapons as a response. You would have to go out of the way to choose to escalate using nuclear rather than as a logical next step in military operations. With that train of thought, I'm convinced that as long as we limit our use of intervention and establish an area of operation and maintain it, then said military response from the U.S &amp; friends won't necessarily lead to Putin using nuclear weapons. 

A hypothetical example would be:

1. we can enforce a limited no fly zone over western Ukraine's airspace where the Russians have yet to set foot in. A buffer zone can be kept between that and the current fronts.
2. If Ukraine start pushing Russia back, we will not be expanding our zone. 
3. Make it abundantly clear that all we are doing here is to ensure some part of Ukraine is left for the people to come back to and be sovereign.

And simultaneously, we communicate that diplomatically:

1. We will leave alone eastern Ukraine for Ukraine and Russia to hash out and in turn the west will abstain from enforcing how the eastern portion will be split / negotiated.
2. We will no longer push for Ukraine to join NATO.

I don't think Putin wants to commit suicide here (or anywhere). We take a strong stance to at least show that we will not tolerate the nuclear knife brandishing from being a reason to not intervene, we make clear our goals and limit our area of operation, and we leave substantial wiggle room for the negotiation table. Once we've applied pressure on the battlefield, we ought to relieve that pressure through diplomatic leeway so you can drive your opponent off the battlefield and on to the negotiation table.",264827d46162db347859eb2263a46c858597e7e5,True,False,,,,,0,1646504476,,0,{},hzh91bm,False,t3_t7bz9h,False,True,t1_hzh2v1a,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t7bz9h/are_there_options_for_western_counterescalation/hzh91bm/,1646504492,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646475676.0,

I think deterrence is better understood as a process — an active process that includes having the means to respond to an enemy attack, but also lots of tactical and strategic actions that allow you to assess the capabilities of your opponent, and ensure the credibility of your deterrent. And all of that entails risk — it entails ""testing"" your enemy. We're used to talking about how ""the US and the USSR always avoided direct confrontation"" after the fact, because it worked. In reality, every time we flew U2s or Oxcarts over the Soviet Union we were testing them and risking retaliation. They could have just kept trying to shoot down our planes, but they also could have gotten fed up and lobbed a couple of artillery shells into West Germany. The Berlin Crisis was a test. The Cuban Missile Crisis was obviously a test. Czechoslovakia and Hungary were tests in the other direction. 

What I am arguing is that a willingness to test Putin's resolve is actually a key component of a credible deterrence. And you're right — we won't know the outcome until we try.

The only reason for NATO to intervene at all, at any point, is to deter further conflict by raising the stakes for Putin. Once Putin has detonated a tactical nuke in Ukraine, the stakes have already been raised, my friend. 

A conventional NATO counterattack would just be a further escalation of an already escalated conflict, against an opponent who has already shown that he is willing to use nukes against a conventional force. If I were a NATO strategist, the moment that Putin uses nukes in Ukraine is the moment I would say, ""this is over — give him whatever he wants, and let's be done with this. Sorry Ukraine."" I find this scenario very unlikely, but it gets to the larger point that the whole reason to have a conventional deterrent in this context is deter a nuclear escalation. Right now, we are, arguably, risking the credibility of that deterrent by making it clear to Russia that as long as they have nukes, we won't stand in their way. 

The counterargument is, ""Ukraine isn't a member of NATO, that's why we're not defending them."" Fair enough. But then the question you have to answer (which no one seems to be responding to) is: would the fact that we signed a piece of paper with Estonia mean that we'd start a nuclear WWIII to prevent the same thing that's happening to Ukraine from happening a country with a fraction of the population that no one can find on the map?

Russia has a small safety net in having China's support, but completely losing access to the majority of the world's markets would hit Russia hard.

NATO military options are always on the table.  I don't see (or support) any type of no-fly zone but if media reports start coming fast and furious of tens of thousands of Ukrainians dead from indiscriminate shelling/bombing, things could change.  I don't see Russia using tactical nuclear weapons but I can imagine several scenarios in which biological or chemical weapons are used, since there is a bit more plausible deniability there.

&gt;I would like to express my candid opinion about Stalin’s views on whether the Red Army and the Soviet Union could have coped with Nazi Germany and survived the war without aid from the United States and Britain. First, I would like to tell about some remarks Stalin made and repeated several times when we were “discussing freely” among ourselves. He stated bluntly that if the United States had not helped us, we would not have won the war. If we had had to fight Nazi Germany one on one, we could not have stood up against Germany’s pressure, and we would have lost the war. No one ever discussed this subject officially, and I don’t think Stalin left any written evidence of his opinion, but I will state here that several times in conversations with me he noted that these were the actual circumstances. He never made a special point of holding a conversation on the subject, but when we were engaged in some kind of relaxed conversation, going over international questions of the past and present, and when we would return to the subject of the path we had traveled during the war, that is what he said. When I listened to his remarks, I was fully in agreement with him, and today I am even more so.

&gt;On the whole the following conclusion can be drawn: that without these Western shipments under Lend-Lease the Soviet Union not only would not have been able to win the Great Patriotic War, it would not have been able even to oppose the German invaders, since it could not itself produce sufficient quantities of arms and military equipment or adequate supplies of fuel and ammunition. The Soviet authorities were well aware of this dependency on Lend-Lease. Thus, Stalin told Harry Hopkins [FDR’s emissary to Moscow in July 1941] that the U.S.S.R. could not match Germany’s might as an occupier of Europe and its resources.",3df0ff69f8837cff7cc102b8eb712dae19605f5f,True,False,,,,,0,1646495593,,0,{},hzgo4cu,False,t3_t6m1a8,False,True,t1_hzg24p7,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t6m1a8/one_week_in_an_operational_assessment_of_the_war/hzgo4cu/,1646495609,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646466793.0,

In both of those conflicts, though, the defenders were essentially militias, with no access to heavy weapons / armor / air power. How feasible is it to attempt to siege a city when the defender still has significant conventional forces available? My intuition says it should be really hard: you have to hold fixed, exposed positions on poorly defended terrain, over many kilometres of cordon (you’re spread thin). The defender can choose when to engage, and can engage in concentrated force.

Of course, I don’t know what I’m talking about or how any of this really works, so I imagine I’m making some bad assumptions, but I’d like to know what they are.

It's really difficult to predict for situations like this because while newer reactors are theoretically safer, broad implementation would mean they'd be operating in places with poor track records on industrial safety and many of the factors that have kept the failure rate where it is might not be applicable. Are we confident a country like China wouldn't cut corners in construction, maintenance, and operation? I'm not so sure given their industrial safety record personally.

Just from a practical standpoint though I don't see a way to construct that many reactors in time to deal with climate change if you were to actually follow the regulations required (which is a major assumption in failure rate estimations).",7a7f37d04683d73c8894eec3a82ef5e0248f3337,True,False,,,,,0,1646491115,,0,{},hzgeiph,False,t3_t5qvsx,False,True,t1_hzg10j7,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t5qvsx/ukraine_megathread_march_3/hzgeiph/,1646491130,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646462315.0,

[],False,,OperationMobocracy,,,[],,,,text,t2_124wre,False,False,"I kind of wonder if some of this is driven by thinking about the Red Army campaign against Nazi Germany and the massive buildups of Soviet armor in the cold war.

You could think of Soviet/Russian ""finesse"" capabilities -- the technical sophistication of their weapons or their military's ability to conduct sophisticated maneuvers.  Then you could think of their numerical capabilities, the kind of power they can successfully project simply because they have vast numbers of things -- armor, planes, artillery.

It's like the aggregate threat is finesse + numerical strength.  Judging their finesse capabilities was hard, solid intelligence on their leadership abilities was hard to come by, and where direct conflict had existed where Western forces were exposed to Russian weapons technology we had limited data that suggested they were at least kind of good -- planes shot down in Vietnam, losses to Russian tanks in the Israeli-Arab wars, and so on.

The lesson of WW II was that even with low finesse, the Soviet application of vast numbers proved effective.  The failure of Arab armies to make use of numerical superiority was attributed to various Arab deficiencies, not Soviet technology per se -- since Soviet SAMs and weapons did down Western planes and kill tanks.

I think the net western intelligence was that Soviet finesse in weapons systems was at least good enough, and even if it wasn't vast numerical power was still something to be reckoned with.  A Soviet offensive with 10 million T-34s in 1970 (as just an absurd example) was still a real threat even if the equipment was kind of obsolete.

If anything, the Western intelligence ""failure"" was maybe not adequately analyzing the corrosive nature of low leadership finesse on large-scale numerical power.  Analysts were still afraid of vast columns of Russian armor just based on size and ""good enough"" performance, but they then switched to nuclear weapons thinking rather than continuing with a conventional analysis  of ""they have crappy logistics, low morale and weak field leadership, so they can't project their good enough numerical superiority very far or very well.""",40698aceac0bad06c20dd5f6f690d525901c3eb8,True,False,,,,,0,1646489939,,0,{},hzgc7po,False,t3_t6spmz,False,True,t1_hzecaii,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t6spmz/is_the_russian_air_force_actually_incapable_of/hzgc7po/,1646489953,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646461139.0,

[],False,,OperationMobocracy,,,[],,,,text,t2_124wre,False,False,"&gt; My personal bet is that this will be a horrible dragged out conflict with a terrible number of lives lost, and it will end with Putin being ousted, overthrown or assassinated from within the Russian government.

Let's say for arguments sake that this is what happens and its mostly bloodless.  Some combination of oligarch financial influence driven by their own wealth interests is able to co-opt the military and the intelligence apparatus.  Combined, they believe that deposing Putin is in their best interest.  The oligarchs are motivated by keeping their fortunes and lifting Western sanctions.  Both the military and the intelligence apparatus see their status as in existential peril under a grinding conflict in Ukraine, and that replacing Putin will result in a pre-Ukrainian war status quo ante for them under a different leader.  So Putin is deposed.

Where does the new leader come from?  The intelligence apparatus?  I'm guessing deposing Putin also results in the most senior tier of the intelligence apparatus most loyal to Putin goes down with him, resulting in no obvious strong leadership candidates from this segment.  The military seems likely to be influential but perhaps not interested in direct political leadership, but only willing to back a leadership which persists the military structure as its own kind of parallel power base albeit subservient to the political leadership.

I'd kind of suspect that the new leadership might emerge from the oligarchs.  But if it does, does the oligarchy have any kind of network (likely informal, but hewing closely to cultural traditions) or means of choosing a ""leader"" from the oligarchy in a bloodless way?  Is there a pecking order to the oligarchy?  Is it based just on wealth, or are there other dimensions to it?

I kind of wonder if the oligarchy could emerge as the leader of the political system with a nominal ""top man"" but actually answering to a kind of council of oligarchs.  I also wonder if the structure of all this might start to look something like South Korea in the 1960s and 1970s.  An authoritarian political system but one with a corporatist nature, where state sanctioned monopolies place their economic success as their highest goal, not expansionist nationalism.  They're willing to clash with the West along the lines of economic competition.  Their larger enemy isn't NATO or Washington, but Western mega corporations, Wall Street and City of London financiers.  As primarily businessmen, the oligarchs see the threat to Russia's future not as columns of Abrams tanks or fleets of warplanes, but Western financial interests who would like to slot Russia into an extractive economy position, a kind of economic colonialism that seeks to buy their raw materials and then sell them finished goods through consumer outlets of Western corporations.",dc9d59e6488b3d9a0829e46e7e748d461b57463c,True,False,,,,,0,1646488463,,0,{},hzg9g6k,False,t3_t6mn73,False,True,t3_t6mn73,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t6mn73/what_happens_after_a_discussion_on_the_potential/hzg9g6k/,1646488475,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646459663.0,

[],False,,Gorechosen,,,[],,,,text,t2_489r3v,False,False,"&gt;Ukraine holds the advantage it seems, in the most crucial aspects of this which are time and money. Ukraine is, at this point, being bankrolled by the most powerful and economically prosperous military alliance in the history of the world whilst its opponent is fighting alone and being economically supressed.  


I have to disagree here, it doesn't look like Ukraine has any advantage at all; their country is still being invaded by a nuclear power and, as much as everyone keeps thinking and assuming it to be the case, they also don't have the birth rate to keep up with an insurgency. Being bankrolled by a 30-nation coalition of the most technologically- and economically-advanced nations in Human history, whose raison d'être is the containment, and if necessary the destruction, of the very state which is invading them, is certainly nothing to be scoffed at. But I maintain that it's not really an advantage unless they can actually pry themselves out of being invaded, which is not going to happen unless they completely renounce the idea of joining NATO.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;On top of this, the Russian military is not a capable enough fighting machine to complete its objectives before the sanctions truly turn Russia upside down (the Ruble has lost 40% of its value in a week). Overall the world's supposed 2nd most powerful military appears to be in much worse condition than anyone could have predicted. Their logistical nightmare, failure to achieve air superiority, morale issues, command issues and more are being exposed to the world.

You'll have to source the ""world's 2nd-most powerful military"" claim, as it sounds more like an assumption rather than a fact, which I don't really buy into. Most analysts would tend to regard China as the 2nd-placed top military force on the planet, and me personally? I'd put Russia into 5th, behind the UK in 3rd and France in 4th. It makes a lot more sense when you then examine their ongoing issues in Ukraine, which you rightly point out as a logistical nightmare and failure to achieve air supremacy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This really leaves Putin with 2 options, go home or keep going. The sensible option is to go home and accept that the gamble didn't pay off. Unfortunately, he won't do that or he can't do that. So he has to escalate, but escalation takes time. He's committed possibly the most well-equipped and professional parts of his military and is now sending over the remaining dregs from Siberia. Establishing a new force and supplying them with fuel/food/water/weaponry whilst also dealing with the current supply issues could take weeks. Weeks his economy doesn't have.

He won't go home because the one fundamental constant that hasn't changed is Ukraine forbidding itself from joining NATO. Until that changes, Russia will not give up ever. Can you reliably source the claim of bringing some kind of new force over from Siberia please? That's news to me. Moreover, I'd argue his economy could hold up for months and years rather than weeks, since it does have a degree of self-sufficiency in basic resources. Whether Russians on the ground are willing to accept a minimum level of survival is another question.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I really don't see the off-ramp for him, unless the military situation changes drastically and Ukrainian cities start falling. The longer this goes on, the worse it gets

Yeah, neither do I. Unfortunately all bridges with the West are now burned, so we are probably going to lurch from one crisis to another from here on out.

I once read an article about the risk probability of disaster for nuclear reactors. They basically just crunched the numbers for 100% of our electricity needs being provided by nuclear energy. The article seems to be lost to time but I've tried replicating it here.

Assumptions:

* We have had nuclear reactors operational for 68 years (1954 - 2022), in which where there have been two nuclear powerplant disasters (not counting near misses or accidents).
* This is gives an approximate disaster rate of once every 34 years (mean time between failures).
* Upper limit of nuclear reactor operation of 40 years
* Average age of nuclear reactors taken to be half this number, 20 years.

Plugging this in provides a failure probability of:

1- (1- (2 \* 40)) / (1 - (2 \* 20)) = approx 1% 

***Not sure about this equation, pulled from here:*** 

https://www.ge.com/digital/documentation/meridium/Help/V43050/Default/Subsystems/ReliabilityAnalytics/Content/CalculateFailureProbability.htm

Nuclear energy now provides about 10% of the world's electricity from about 440 power reactors.

Assuming we simply multiply this 10 to take it to 100%, gives us 4400 reactors.

With a failure probability of 1% at any given time for 4400 reactors, we could expect a disaster every **x?** number of years. Not sure about this part.

I think this is cause of the poor performance of the Russian airfoce. The Ukrainians breached the Russian IFF codes.

I will add your comment.  
After reading this article, I noticed that the author completely ignores the maneuvers of the Russian army, which are held every 2 years with the participation of all branches of the military. (Lately every year)  
For example, 200 thousand people and about 220 aircraft are involved in the Zapad-2021 exercises.  
The Vostok-2018 exercises involved 300,000 people and 1,000 aircraft.  
I have not seen NATO conduct such maneuvers.  
Why doesn't Russia use planes en masse now? It seems to me that the real reason is ammunition, Russia is at least trying to reduce civilian casualties. And using expensive adjustable ammunition to destroy ""cheap"" targets is not profitable.  
The problems of expensive ammunition are typical not only for Russia.  
Here is an article about NATO's actions in Libya:  
https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/nato-runs-short-on-some-munitions-in-libya/2011/04/15/AF3O7ElD\_story.html  
  
""Less than a month into the Libyan conflict, NATO is running short of precision bombs, highlighting the limitations of Britain, France and other European countries in sustaining even a relatively small military action over an extended period of time, according to senior NATO and US officials.  
  
The shortage of European munitions, along with the limited number of aircraft available, has raised doubts among some officials about whether the United States can continue to avoid returning to the air campaign if Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi hangs on to power for several more months.""  
  
And this is just Libya against which there was an alliance with the largest military budget in the world. People forget that the manufacture of modern ammunition is not the production of bombs from the Second World War. It takes time and money, a lot of money. In a real NATO war against Russia, all countries will be forced to introduce a wartime economy. Otherwise, with a high intensity of hostilities, all participants will simply run out of ammunition ...  
My opinion is that Russia is saving expensive bombs and missiles for more important purposes. If this conflict turns into the ultimate massacre, Russia will not hesitate to bomb 24/7  
Ukrainian positions not caring about ""collateral damage"".  
As the allies did in Syria (especially in the city of Raqqa), or as Russia itself did in Syria.

&gt;...One potential argument is that the VKS fighter fleets are being held in reserve, potentially as a deterrent against direct intervention by NATO forces. This is unlikely to be the case. If the VKS is capable of large-scale combat operations to rapidly establish air superiority over Ukraine, by not doing so, it is, in fact, weakening its potential deterrent value against NATO forces rather than preserving it. The failure of the much-feared Russian Army to rapidly overwhelm the much smaller and poorly positioned Ukrainian forces, and its heavy losses of modern vehicles and personnel, have already seriously damaged international perceptions of Russia’s conventional military power. From a NATO deterrence standpoint, the Russian General Staff and the Kremlin have every incentive to employ their airpower to maximum effect to re-establish some of this lost credibility...

&gt;...Another theory is that Russian commanders are less willing to risk suffering heavy losses to their expensive and prestigious fast jets, and so have held back the VKS due to low risk tolerance. This also does not make sense. Russian ground forces have lost hundreds of modern tanks, armoured personnel carriers, short- and medium-range air-defence systems and thousands of troops including a disproportionate number of elite paratroopers (VDV) and special forces in a week.

This is the only footage of the use of Russian aviation in Ukraine from the Russian side  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3gjcPOx3W0

Who do you think is bombing the positions of the Ukrainian troops every night? Including in Kyiv, where the Ukrainian army has the strongest saturation of MANPADS. This is what RuAF does.  
The author of the article is right that this is done at night to avoid MANPADS. The performance of combat missions at night in itself speaks of the excellent training of pilots, since the performance of combat missions at night is incomparable, I repeat, incomparable in complexity than the performance of the same operations during the day. Why is this ""respected"" expert silent about this?  
If there is a combat pilot among you, confirm my words.  
If Russian aviation is not a problem, why has President Zelensky of Ukraine begged NATO to introduce a no-fly zone since the early days of the war?  
Now the fog of war, so treat any information immediately biased, especially from sources who feel sympathy for the Ukrainian side. Instead, look at the real facts.  
Here is an interview with Oleksiy Nikolaevich Arestovich (non-staff adviser to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andriy Yermak on strategic communications in the field of national security and defense)

Russia has no experience in overcoming air defense systems, if they poke their noses at Ukraine, they will lose all their aircraft.""  
And now the reality: The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine admitted that they had lost air defense. In their FB post.  
I can't go there, Facebook is blocked in Russia, so take the trouble to find it yourself.
