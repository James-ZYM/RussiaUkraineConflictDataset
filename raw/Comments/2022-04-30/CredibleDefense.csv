But I would combine strong support for Ukraine with clear signalling that 1) the West does not seek regime change in Russia 2) de-escalation will lead to reciprocal measures 3) channels remain open.

I agree, I think we need to communicate clearly why we're escalating and what will enable us to de-escalate.  But I also think any such communication will be ineffective if Putin has absolutely no desire to de-escalate, which at present he's not signaling.

The thing is, for over a decade now Putin's diplomatic strategy when it comes to the west has been

a) count on us to be mostly appeasing

b) take advantage of our appeasement to accomplish goals that he thinks we won't seriously contest

c) sell to his domestic audience that it's the West that's escalating

d) run away giggling like skeletor

This was also his game plan going into the invasion, and while it didn't immediately work, that's still the strategy he's sticking to when it comes to trying to limit our support for Ukraine, just now by well, exploiting the fact that we can't be sure he won't go nuclear.  Hell, it's been so long that we actually put our foot down that he might just not have another diplomatic strategy for the west anymore.

Either way, I think your criticism of our current communication efforts is valid.  But also I don't think Putin's serious about de-escalating right now and I'm not sure our words will change that - only the reality on the ground will.

And yes, that's very imperfect and unpredictable.

&gt;  
&gt;In case it's unclear I was wrong, effing wrong on a monumental scale (the logic was sound but I failed to discount for corruption)

I don't think you were wrong. That Russia would perform significantly worse than the U.S. isn't a surprise, even when one (IMO, correctly) calculates their defense spending on a PPP (or, even better, military-specific PPP) basis.

Thus, on a PPP basis and using the NATO definition of military spending, the U.S. spent $811 billion in 2021 on 1,395,350 active personnel, or $581,216 per person.

On the same basis, Russia in turn spent $169 billion on 900,000 active personnel, or $187,778 per person - slightly less than a third of what the U.S. spent on per capita. But then \~30% of the total active Russian force is composed of yearly conscripts that barely have time to integrate within units before exiting military life. Although their wages are low, their training and sustainment must absorb a non-trivial share of overall Russian defense spending.

Thus I'd say it's no surprise that Russia is not showing itself to be very proficient. Given their level of defense spending, for them to spend equivalent figures as the U.S. on a per capita basis they would have to maintain an active force of \~290,000 personnel.

Sergey Radchenko, Historian of the Cold War and after. Wilson E. Schmidt Distinguished Professor @KissingerCenter @SAISHopkins

1. A thread on the danger of a nuclear war. I have talked here about my deep concern that we may inadvertently end up in a nuclear war by upping the ante and stepping up the escalation ladder. I'll be honest: this concern of mine goes against some things I previously argued.

2. Consider, for example, the article @CampbellCraig1 and I wrote a few years ago for @jststs, titled juicily ""MAD, not Marx: Khrushchev and the nuclear revolution."" The article was about, you guessed it, the Cuban Missile Crisis. Here's the link: https://tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2017.1330683.
tandfonline.com
MAD, not Marx: Khrushchev and the nuclear revolution
(2018). MAD, not Marx: Khrushchev and the nuclear revolution. Journal of Strategic Studies: Vol. 41, No. 1-2, pp. 208-233.

3.  In the article, drawing on declassified records, we argued that Khrushchev for all his nuclear sabre-rattling would have gone to every length to avoid a nuclear war. It was *despite* the existence of a nuclear strategy in the USSR. He was readying for a war he would never fight.


4. The article was a response to those who argued that America's adversaries could wage a nuclear war; therefore the US, too, should be prepared to wage such a war. History of the Cold War shows (clearly) that there was no such intention in Moscow, ever.

5. So this kind of academic reasoning should have me feel on the safer side today, and yet I have been very alarmist in my comments. Why is this? Well, for one thing, this war has a strong emotional component for me, and this (maybe) clouds analytical judgment.

6. If I were to take a detached attitude and say: look, history says it's not going to happen, and then it happens - will it not mean that I will share the responsibility for being so damn self-assured that I ignored such a tremendous danger?

7. I feel this sense of responsibility, which brings me down from the unassailable heights of my self-proclaimed historical expertise. I then ask probing questions.

8. First, unlike Khrushchev, who had direct experience of WWII (he lost a son &amp; was at Stalingrad), Putin does not know what a major war is like. I mean, of course he knows. But not at *that* personal level like the Soviet leaders, Khrushchev and Brezhnev, who tasted it firsthand.

9. Second, in the Cuban Missile Crisis, Khrushchev's withdrawal meant a loss of prestige, yes, and it backfired against him politically (he was toppled for several reasons but his ""adventurism"" in Cuba was certainly among them). But it didn't entail immediate political demise.

10. Can Putin ""lose"" in Ukraine and survive politically? Maybe he can. But the question is arguably more ""existential"" for him than it was for Khrushchev. Because if he *is* toppled, will he live? The system he created mitigates against such eventualities.

11. So if it's a question of personal survival vs. a potential nuclear war, which option will he choose? I don't know. And history does not provide data points to reassure.

12. Complexities, complexities. I've spent *years* studying this question. I am just not sure. It's not because I am so dumb. It's because the question is more complex than anyone can tell. If you see brave assertions to the contrary, don't believe them. They are based on BS.

13. Does this mean we should back out and offer Putin ""off-ramps."" Not necessarily. But I would combine strong support for Ukraine with clear signalling that 
1) the West does not seek regime change in Russia
2) de-escalation will lead to reciprocal measures
3) channels remain open.

14. We have seen little of this in recent days / weeks. Instead, we have heard increasingly tough rhetoric and ambiguity about the endgame. Important to talk softly, while carrying a big stick. Important to remember that we simply cannot know how close we are to the brink.

A Ukrainian counteroffensive out of Kharkiv City will likely alleviate pressure on parts of the city that have suffered the most from Russian shelling and may force Russian troops from Izyum to re-deploy northward to support forces maintaining the partial encirclement of Kharkiv.

Additional Russian forces are deploying to the Izyum front but are unlikely to enable any major advances.
Russian troops did not make any confirmed advances to the southwest or southeast of Izyum or to the west of the Donetsk-Luhansk frontline.

Russian forces in Kherson are pausing major offensive operations to improve their tactical positions and regroup to prepare for a renewed offensive to capture the administrative borders of Kherson.

I'd say he could take half the country before it got too costly with losses.

Also he'd have to declare war (or not, he's a dictator), but any formal acknowledgment of a draft is serious because Putin probably can't survive a lost war politically.

My take is that the analysts are probably wrong and he's going to wind this back soon. Full war on Ukraine in a gamble that could end his life. The thing I worry about is that the rumors are true and he is sick or dying and thinks this is his last chance to rebuild a great Russian empire. Then war may be on and that's bad for everyone because he's probably not going to back off during a loss and may double down on chemical weapons and even nuclear ones.

&gt;What we believe actually happened, however, is that the Ukrainians fired two (2) Neptune ASCMs, the MOSKVA did not destroy or defeat either of them, both missiles hit the MOSKVA, and the MOSKVA suffered severe damage that eventually led it to sink

&gt;This analysis shows that the MOSKVA, while likely to be severely damaged, should not have been sunk. And, in fact, MOSKVA did not sink immediately. However, it does suggest that possibly MOSKVA's damage control (DC) efforts to combat the sustained damage were not all they could have been. However, ship design plays a significant part in the ability of a given ship to sustain damage. For example, MOSKVA's main armament, 16 large P-500 Bazalt or P-1000 Vulcan ASCMs, were housed in 16 large missile tubes, taking up much of the exposed deck space of the MOSKVA. Should a missile hit one or more of these launchers, it is presumed that it might cause a significant secondary fire or explosion, causing even more damage than an incoming missile might cause.

Their position as it stands today threatens multiple Ukrainian troop strongholds and strategic points.

They've moved into Yanpil, and the main bridge between Lyman and Sloviansk across the Sieversky Donets river was completely destroyed last night, so now they threaten positions in Lyman along a wide front and Lyman's ability to resupply from Sloviansk is reduced greatly.

Meanwhile, forces in Sieverodonetsk are seeing Russians from 3 directions and a river from the fourth.

And while yes, progress from Izium has been slow, there has been progress, and they're crawling closer to Ukrainian lines of communication.

These are not tactical situations you're ecstatic to be in as a Ukrainian commander.  These are dangerous, uncertain positions that even a greatly attritioned aggressor has the potential to exploit.

Yes, for now the Ukrainian defensive front is holding, which forces all Russian gains to be incremental and painstaking.  Yes, the Ukrainian capital is no longer under threat and the Russians will likely run out of impetus within weeks.

Over the past 40-plus years, the Islamic Republic of Iran has targeted dissidents, Western opponents, Israelis, and Jews in assassination plots, abduction plots, and surveillance operations that facilitate both. Iran has carried out such external operations around the world, in countries with both strong and weak law enforcement agencies, border crossings, and intelligence services. It has done so consistently over the years, including at times and in places where carrying out such operations could undermine key Iranian diplomatic efforts, such as negotiations over the country’s nuclear program. This study, based on a dataset of 98 Iranian plots from 1979 through 2021, maps out key trends in Iranian external operations plotting.

Quotes:

&gt; * This study draws on an unclassified and open-source dataset of 98 cases of Iranian external operations from December 1979 through December 2021.

&gt; * …while the Islamic Republic of Iran has a long history of engaging in operations such as these, it appears to have picked up the pace over the past decade (2011-2021) and exhibited multiple patterns 

&gt; * The first such case in the United States took place in July 1980 when Iranian agents recruited David Belfied (aka Dawud Salahuddin), an American convert to Shi`a Islam, to assassinate former Iranian diplomat Ali Akbar Tabatabai in Bethesda, Maryland.

&gt; * In February 2021, a Belgian court convicted Assadollah Assadi… According to German and Belgian prosecutors, Assadi was no run-of-the-mill diplomat but rather an Iranian intelligence officer operating under diplomatic cover.

&gt; * The Paris plot appears especially audacious in its scope. The perpetrators intended to detonate an indiscriminate explosive device instead of carrying out a targeted assassination; Assadi smuggled TATP and a detonator onto a flight from Iran to Austria…

&gt; * …the foiled Paris plot was just one in a string of Iranian operations carried out by Iranian operatives or their proxies.

&gt; * Weeks earlier, a German court convicted an Iranian agent for spying after he scouted targets in Germany in 2016, including the head of the German-Israeli Association.

&gt; * At least 26 well-documented such plots have occurred in the three years since the Paris plot in places as far afield as Colombia, Cyprus, Denmark, Dubai, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Iraq, Israel, Kenya, the Netherlands, Scotland, Sweden, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States

&gt; * One theme that stands out is Iran’s willingness to carry out such operations, typically in a manner the regime believes will grant it some measure of deniability

&gt; * Targeting Iranian dissidents has been a constant feature of Iranian external operations. Immediately after the founding of the Islamic Republic, the new Iranian leadership spearheaded an assassination campaign aimed at individuals the regime determined were working against its interest. The CIA found that between 1979 and 1994, Iran “murdered Iranian defectors and dissidents in West Germany, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Turkey.”22 In total, the new regime targeted over 60 individuals in assassination attempts.23 Often, these plots involved members of Hezbollah, who served as logistics experts or gunmen.

&gt; * 22 out of the 42 Iranian cases targeting dissidents in this dataset occurred within the past decade.

&gt; * in some cases they exhibited poor operational tradecraft and traveled on Iranian documents, used their true Iranian names, carried Iranian currency, used the same SIM card for operations in different countries, or allowed their pictures to be taken with local prostitutes

&gt; * Over the past decade, a number of aggressive Iranian plots in the West have forced U.S. and European security experts to reconsider long-held assessments regarding the assumed limits of Iranian external operations.

&gt; * Kourani carried out surveillance of U.S. government agencies in New York and airports in New York and Toronto, while el-Debek surveilled U.S. and Israeli interests, as well as the Panama Canal Zone, in Panama.

&gt; * The arrests prompted the U.S. intelligence community to revisit its longstanding assessment that Hezbollah would be unlikely to attack the U.S. homeland unless the group perceived Washington to be taking action directly threating the existence of its patrons in Tehran.

&gt; * “It’s our assessment that Hezbollah is determined to give itself a potential homeland option as a critical component of its terrorism playbook.”

&gt; * Over time, the Library of Congress study reports, a division of labor developed between the MOIS and Quds Force regarding international operations. The “MOIS has mostly concentrated on monitoring and assassinating Iranian dissidents inside and outside of the country,” while “the Qods Force is in charge of covert military and paramilitary actions outside of Iran’s territory, including the assassination of foreign individuals, such as Israeli officials, as well as training of militant groups and gathering of information in regions of interest to Iran.”

&gt; * In Thailand, police rushed to the scene of an explosion at a home rented by a group of Iranians. Two barefoot men fled the house, but a third was injured and tried to hail a taxi to escape. When the taxi refused to stop, the injured man threw a bomb at the car, destroying half the vehicle and injuring the driver and four bystanders. Police soon cornered the injured suspect, who tried to throw another explosive at them but was too weak; the resulting explosion blew off both his legs.

&gt; * In this and a series of other operations, Iranian agents reused phone numbers and SIM cards across multiple operations, traveled on Iranian passports, checked in to hotels as Iranians, carried Iranian currency in their wallets, and in at least one instance, took off time from their surveillance to party with prostitutes. A group photo on the cell phone of one of the prostitutes helped identify accomplices, one of whom was arrested at the airport while the other managed to escape.

&gt; * Iranian officials also seem to reward initiative, even aggressive initiatives that are not necessarily sanctioned in advance or ultimately successful. By some accounts, that explains the 2007 detention of British Royal Navy personnel in the Persian Gulf.

&gt; * Iran continues to engage in such activities because it can. Experience has taught Iran that the benefits of such actions (as Iran perceives them) outweigh the few and typically temporary consequences. Law enforcement action and financial designations are appropriate but insufficient responses to such activities. They should be complemented by firm diplomatic isolation, travel bans preventing family members of Iranian leaders from studying abroad or going on European shopping sprees, and other actions that would feel truly consequential for Iranian decision makers.",973df616287aab50ebc591d9231aef8a740b7356,True,False,,,,,0,1651348027,,0,{},i6tpubc,True,t3_ufiigp,False,True,t3_ufiigp,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ufiigp/trends_in_iranian_external_assassination/i6tpubc/,1651348040,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651319227.0

&gt;De facto, these are two states. The world has largely agreed to pretend that this is one state to avoid angering China, but when push comes to shove Taiwan will be treated as a state.

There is no such thing as a ""de facto state"". Typical western smudging of the facts to justify their behavior. You are either a state or you are not. There is no in between. No such thing exist in any theory of states or international law. 

The world is not ""pretending"" that this is one state. *It is* one state. The powers bestowed on the presidents of ROC are granted under the Chinese Nanjing Constitution, there is no such thing as a Taiwanese constitution. ROC = Republic of China, Not republic of taiwan.

They have no sovereignty as you can only be sovereign if you're a state.

 Trying to twist and turn the facts won't change the reality. 

And if push comes to shove and Taiwan is treated as a state, then you would have broken international law. So if you don't respect international laws then might as well have no laws. Or does international law only apply when it suits one party?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I agree that it's completely unacceptable for any Chinese government to not claim Taiwan. However, I think national sovereignty and face are at least strongly related concepts. Many countries cannot bear the ego damage of accepting that some piece of territory is no longer theirs.  
  
For example, the Indian claim to Aksai Chin, and the pointless border fistfights along the line of control. There is no value to such conflict, yet it has persisted for decades. India cannot bear the loss of face.

Let's put it this way, it is possible to lose face without losing sovereignty. One has far more severe consequences than the other. Losing face without losing sovereignty might be palatable. But losing sovereignty is a red line because it threatens your very existence. To attribute this issue to something as simplistic as mere loss of face is like taking someone's kid and saying you're just afraid to look embarrassed if you don't fight get him back. 

&gt;Of course, I also expect that China must grow its naval capability significantly to make an assault realistic, so maybe we can revisit Taiwanese resolve in 5 or 10 years.

China already has the full capability to take Taiwan. The only issue is Western interference. If the US ceases to exist, China would take Taiwan tomorrow. It would be a different story if Taiwan is actually serious about fighting. A fully functional reserve army and conscripted force would be a force to be reckoned with. But they aren't willing to die for it.  They will talk all about how they feel like they're Taiwanese but anyone can talk. Put your money where your mouth is. Stop buying fancy weapons for show, cozying up to the US weapons manufacturers and put in the work. There's a reason why no ROC president wants to increase taxes and re-establish conscription. Because it has no political capital. People aren't willing to fight for it. They're existence aren't being threatened. They just don't get to have things their way if they lose. Boohoo. But life goes on. No existential crisis there. 

But if you concede Taiwan, well the very meaning of being Chinese is gone. Being Chinese no longer has any meaning if anyone can just take it away from you. Piece by piece. You have lost your sovereignty. This is what westerners will never understand. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;For example, the Indian claim to Aksai Chin, and the pointless border fistfights along the line of control. There is no value to such conflict, yet it has persisted for decades. India cannot bear the loss of face.

Aksai Chin is a completely different issue. It is a border dispute between two sovereign states. There are no borders between China and Taiwan because Taiwan is a part of China. 

&gt;Can you give any concrete example of America doing such?  
  
I don't see any present or near future bargaining using Taiwan.

There are plenty of reasons to use Taiwan as a bargaining chip. You really don't see any future of using it? LOL. 

US: ""Hey China! Russia's being a little bitch. Tell everyone what a bitch Russia is will ya?""

China: ""No.""

US: ""We care about Taiwanese Freedom and Human Rights! China is conducting Genocide in Taiwan! They are erasing their unique identity and freedoms that we care so much about!""

China: ""Okay Okay shut up. Fine, Russia is a little bitch.""

US: ""Okay, thanks! That was helpful. I'll keep quiet about Taiwan. Shhhh Taiwan? What is taiwan? Taiwan doesn't exist! What human rights? Taiwanese aren't even human!""

Really dude? You've never seen this happening and you think it won't continue to happen? LOL.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Liberalizing China wasn't a benevolent policy aim. The US was aiming to end the threat of the CPC in the same way it ended the USSR. This policy was probably a bad idea, and in any case is too risky to pursue today. Containment is certainly the order of the day.

The US isn't aiming to end the threat of the CPC. Please. They are aiming to end the threat of ANY of competition CPC or not. CPC or ABC or BCD or the ULTIMATE FREEDOM LOVING ULTRA DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF CHINA, it doesn't matter. 

It doesn't matter if it's one person one vote or one person and his dog gets to vote or if every living organism in China gets to vote three times. 

All that matters is China = Weak, US = Strong. Get it? 

And this is a very dangerous path to go down. Instead of trying to contain China, they should seek co-operation and increase globalization and partnerships. They should offer mutual respect and win-win situations. Instead of using China's problems as a bargaining chip or an extra stick to hit it with, give them suggestions. Talk to them. Invite them to join global efforts. The only way to prevent war is to further interlink the economies and partnerships. China isn't out to conquer the world. They want to be prosperous and happy. 

By pursuing a containment strategy and zero sum game, war is inevitable. Instead of focusing on containing China in order to reduce the competition, focus on yourselves and solve your own problems and make yourselves more competitive.

[],False,,checco_2020,,,[],,,,text,t2_26hdj2mi,False,False,"Since i had nothing to do i began thinking about what option do the Russians have if they want to invade Ukraine from transistria.  
  


now lets start with some ground rules, i am going to use only the numbers of professional troops present at the moment in transistria , i know that they have begun mobilization, however it will take months to make this troops capable of doing offensive operation, so i will consider the number of military personal that transistria has to be around 7000, 5500 of their army and 1500 of the Russian peacekeeping force).  
Therefore i think that the invasion force would consist of around 6000 people, someone needs to stay back, and not all of 7000 are going to be combat troops, as for equipment i think that they will throw almost everything that they have so, 18 tanks, 100 IFV+APC and 40 AA guns, i don't have any numbers on the number of MLRS that they have soo i cant include it, still i imagine its not more then 2 dozens, later i will explain why i didn't include aircrafts.   
  


Another aspect that we have to take into consideration is the founding that the army has,  
we know the GDP of the country but we don't know the share of GDP used for the armed forces, so i will use the  same share of GDP of the Russian federation, so 4.3% (rounded up to 4.5 for easier calculation).  
The GDP of transistria is 1 Billion dollars a year, with a spending of 4.5% for the mylitary we end up with, 45 Milion dollars a year, which means that transitria has around 8,200 dollars a year for each soldier, just for comparison Russia spends for each of its soldier around 70,000 , 8.5 times as much.  
This very rough calculation serves to illustrate that the transistrian forces must have some grievous issues with maintenance of their equipment.  
And this is why before i haven't included aircrafts, maintaining helicopters and fixed win aircrafts is expensive and transistria simply doesn't have the money.  
  


Now lets get to the point, what can this limited force hope to do, I would immediately exclude any offensive in the North and in the center, as those would encounter many urban settlements and in general wouldn't achieve anything before being stopped by the TDF and destroyed by the regular army.  
Instead i think that the best curse of action would be to aim to cut one route of resupply  to Ukraine, that is the supply route that goes from Romania into Odessa, so the objective should be to capture the villages of Mayaky and Karolino-Buhaz, as those vilalges are the only ones that have highroads that connect the West and East side of the lower Dnestr river.  
  


Now to make the attack the staging point should be the town of Nezavertailovca, and from there take the T1625 in Hradenytsi, then go through Troits'ke, Yas'ky, Biljaïvka, and then arriving at the first objective, Mayaky.  
In the end the first part of the journey is around 40 km long and needs to go trough 6 small towns and villages.  
Now After a consistent group of soldier has been left behind to secure the blockade of the road, another group needs to continue on the T1625 and go through Nadlymans'ke, Mykolaivka, Kalahliya, Ovidiopol, Roksolany, and then arriving at destination, that is Karolino-Buhaz.    
The second part of the journey is another 44 Km longs and needs to go through another 6 small towns and villages.  
So in total to reach its objectives the invasion force needs to make an 84 km and to conquer 12 small towns and villages.

Lets start with the problem of this, and there are a lot.

1. The quality of the force, it simply is abysmal, it's a small force with outdated and poorly maintained equipment, there is no way around it.
2. The logistics, this force has too drive 80 km trough hostile territory with old equipment, for the majority of it one road, there simply isn't a scenario in which the vehicles don't start breaking down or remain without fuel, or the troops remain without bullets, and/or food.
3. Lack of air and artillery cover, the transistrians don't have many native artillery system and dont have any aircraft, and the Russians can't provide consistent air cover.
4. The terrain, there is going to be a lot of Urban fighting, this type of warfare requires either a lot of manpower to clear every building, or a lot of artillery and air support to level everything, and the transistrians lack both.
5. The morale, for what exactly are this soldiers gonna fight for? for the possibility that some explosions that killed nobody where the Ukrainians fault?
6. The predictability, it really doesn't take long for anyone to guess which way a possible transitrian attack would come trough, unless they want to involve Moldavia (I will talk about it later).
7. The enemy, its something that we haven't talked about but its obviously a fundamental part, the Ukranians would have more professional soldiers then the transistrians in a few days and even before they arrive there is going to be a lot of national guard and TDF units raking havoc in the rearguard, and slowing the advance.
8. Enemy air assets, we have seen Ukrainians hit russians columns with drones helicopters and in some cases even aircrafts, and they had both advanced sam systems and fighter jets, something that the  transitrians don't have.
9. Enemy artillery, this point is nearly self explanatory, the Ukranians are receiving and already have a lot of artillery, they are going to use it.
10. The vulnerability of the front,  as stated before their supplies need to come from a single road so it becomes extremely vulnerable to hit and run attacks, shelling, etc.
11. Total lack of tactical surprise, with NATO awacs flying just behind them every movement that the invasion force is going to make is going to be seen by NATO and relayed in real time to Ukraine.  


Who that is a long list, i am sure i have forgot something.  


I left out an invasion trough Moldavia  because that doesn't fix any of the already present problems but rather it creates more of them.  
Namely, that they will have to fight even more enemies.  


In the end, is this invasion likely to succeeded? i would say that it isn't, am i sure that it wouldn't happen? No, we have seen the Russians do many stupid things since the start of the war, so who knows what might happen.",3d0d06f3f20f0797972422d760de1c6ee8b16436,True,False,,,,,0,1651345613,,0,{},i6tktwp,False,t3_uf9n5g,False,False,t3_uf9n5g,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uf9n5g/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_30_2022/i6tktwp/,1651345624,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651316813.0

&gt; * As journalists, we expected to lose many of our contacts in the Russian military and secret services after the invasion...

&gt; * Last week we began to receive more and more calls and messages from our contacts in the military and in the FSB

&gt; * ...Sergei Beseda, one of the heads of the Fifth Service of the FSB, who gathers political intelligence on Ukraine and cultivates the pro-Kremlin opposition in Kyiv. The general was sent to the infamous Lefortovo prison in Moscow...

&gt; * Russia’s military believes that limiting the war’s initial goals is a serious error. They now argue that Russia is not fighting Ukraine, but NATO. Senior officers have therefore concluded that the Western alliance is fighting all out (through the supply of increasingly sophisticated weaponry) while its own forces operate under peacetime constraints like a bar on airstrikes against some key areas of Ukraine’s infrastructure. In short, the military now demands all-out war, including mobilization.

&gt; * Privately, the army, and even the secret services, have been heard to blame not only the Fifth Service of the FSB for misinforming the president, but also the president himself for making a bad call on changing the military strategy.

&gt; * Does it matter? It matters a lot. This is the very first time the siloviki are putting distance between themselves and the president. Which opens up all sorts of possibilities.

------------------

The author of the article says that the Kremlin has responded to his article, and brought Beseda back out.

The FSB has carried out a spectacular op in response to our reporting: Sergei Beseda was brought in at the funeral of a KGB veteran Nikolai Leonov, news reported by @RTVI_en Beseda gave a speech. Looks like a desperate attempt to deny a conflict between siloviki during the war.

I’m not going to debate you if you keep spewing your rabble without you first actually reading what my previous post said, and secondly if you actually show knowledge in this subject.

PPP IS a measure of GDP, it’s just a different way of calculating it. The only thing you got somewhat correct is that it is *nominal* (another way of measuring gross domestic product) GDP that is a measure of a countries trading power. And that’s trading power worldwide, not just with the United States.

What you are arguing is that measuring nominal GDP is bad because developing countries have undervalued currencies. However you fail to grasp that they are valued at their worth in the global economic system for a reason. Developing countries need their currency to be weaker to make their exports competitive whilst keeping internal production and therefore wages cheaper. 

If you increased the strength of the currency to what you are calling the “true size” so to the PPP GDP, these countries economies would collapse in a short space of time.

* City was well prepared with cross fire zones and traps, Russian infantry suffered horrific casualties moving through residential area. Ukrainian retreats orderly and planned 

* The replacements for his unit were almost entirely conscripts poorly equipped with “semi automatic rifles” (SKSs maybe? Video didn’t specify) and had minimal training. 

* Russian conscription efforts in the LNR and DNR are getting extreme and scraping the bottom of the barrel 

* Video did not make clear if the man was discharged or deserted but he left the front lines and has no intention of returning.

[],False,,SmokingPuffin,,,[],,,,text,t2_8f0cw,False,False,"&gt;Look, like it or not, Taiwan and China are one and the same. They are the same damn state. There is no Taiwan. Taiwan IS China. The only issue here is both CCP and ROC's competing claims to govern. Those people in Taiwan ARE CHINESE. They are not even brothers lol. Ukraine and Russia are brothers. Taiwan and China are part of the same body! It's like your right hand and left hand slapping each other.

I grant that Taiwanese were Chinese 80 years ago, but identity changes over time. That's not how [the Taiwanese see it](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2021/08/11/2003762406). A supermajority of Taiwanese describe themselves as not Chinese. Holding both Chinese and Taiwanese identity is a minority view, and hardly anyone describes themselves as solely Chinese. Side note -- in a bizarre twist of fate, Taiwanese people most like Japan and most dislike China.

De facto, these are two states. The world has largely agreed to pretend that this is one state to avoid angering China, but when push comes to shove Taiwan will be treated as a state.

&gt;Like it or not, if the US intervenes in Taiwan, there is no moral high ground. You are invading a sovereign state to pursue your own national interests. Now that happens all the time but please, stop trying to claim to be some morally superior GOOD GUYS in every damn Hollywood movie.

You've badly misunderstood me. I'm a realist. American action in Taiwan wouldn't be heroism. Moral superiority has no direct relevance in statecraft -- sometimes you can get some popular support by seeming moral, and that is relevant.

&gt;Taiwan isn't just a damn face saving issue. It's a matter of national sovereignty. No government will survive in China if they refuse to fight for Taiwan.

I agree that it's completely unacceptable for any Chinese government to not claim Taiwan. However, I think national sovereignty and face are at least strongly related concepts. Many countries cannot bear the ego damage of accepting that some piece of territory is no longer theirs.

For example, the Indian claim to Aksai Chin, and the pointless border fistfights along the line of control. There is no value to such conflict, yet it has persisted for decades. India cannot bear the loss of face.

&gt;This is actually one of the major weaknesses in Taiwan's defense if a war were to break out. People assume that the Taiwanese would behave like the Ukrainians under an invasion. It's the exact opposite. Fight a prolonged guerilla warfare? Lol.

So far, all that has happened in Ukraine is that civilians have fled and the Ukrainian military is doing surprisingly well in conventional warfare. There isn't a lot of partisan, guerrilla, or irregular force activity, and I don't know whether there would be in an alternate history where Kiev surrendered in 48 hours.

Today, I expect that Taiwan would fight as hard as Ukraine has so far. Of course, I also expect that China must grow its naval capability significantly to make an assault realistic, so maybe we can revisit Taiwanese resolve in 5 or 10 years.

&gt;And btw the US uses Taiwan as a bargaining chip all the time. How can you even say otherwise? Lol.

Can you give any concrete example of America doing such?

I don't see any present or near future bargaining using Taiwan. Maybe in the Reagan era, there was some use of Taiwan as a carrot: become a liberal democracy and we'll give you Taiwan. Those days are long gone now. I can't see any plausible bargain to be made regarding Taiwan today, and certainly America isn't offering trades.

&gt;Please don't buy into the whole liberalizing China bs. Come on... how long are you gonna sell the ""we are not here to invade or hurt you. We are here to liberate you!""
&gt;  
&gt;America when it comes to China has one goal and one goal only. To contain China and maintain it's supremacy. It doesn't matter if it's a liberal china or communist or whatever. If a ""liberal"" China were to outcompete the US, they will do the same. And I'm not demonizing the US for doing it. It's just human nature.

Liberalizing China wasn't a benevolent policy aim. The US was aiming to end the threat of the CPC in the same way it ended the USSR. This policy was probably a bad idea, and in any case is too risky to pursue today.

[],False,,krakenchaos1,,,[],,,,text,t2_a0f2f01t,False,False,"I can't open the site for some reason, but I think what's worth seeing in context is that China's military spending as a proportion of GDP is below the global average and relatively stable. Going by the latest SIRPI report, the raw number of China's military spending increases steadily by each year, but as a % of GDP it sits at ~1.7%. Reforms in the mid 2010s changed allocation, but did not significantly raise totals.

Going by the latest SIPRI report, which I believe this article bases its, it's notable to see that with spending as % of GDP, the US is listed at 3.5%, India at 2.7%, South Korea at 2.2%, and Japan at a low 1.1%. The world average sits at 2.2%. The US comprises 38% of the world's spending, China comprises 14%, while India at #3 makes up 3.6%.

I think the question of ""why doesn't China spend more on its military"" is a very interesting one, and I'll line out my thoughts in no particular orders.

* Very good economies of scale. Are costs for China low enough to the point that they are able to extract more for lower costs? I personally think this is definitely a factor, but not the sole or even primary explanation. China's avg wages have increased at a faster rate of military spending, though pay definitely not the only factor.

* Lack of political will. Basically the old guns and butter graph. Military spending comes at an opportunity cost for spending on other things that would result in a higher ROI for society overall, and perhaps China just doesn't perceive the military to be worth allocating more money to.

* Inaccurate reporting/estimates. China may be underreporting its spending, either due to technicalities in classification or purposefully as an act of deception. I remember seeing a study while back that argued that China's actual GDP is consistently understated in official GDP growth reports, would it be possible that military spending have the same issue?",a4f96994e4c69a657cd8a138909dc19fa69871e1,True,False,,,,,0,1651335034,,0,{},i6sxkcx,False,t3_ufcrw0,False,True,t3_ufcrw0,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ufcrw0/chinas_2022_defense_budget_behind_the_numbers/i6sxkcx/,1651335047,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651306234.0

These companies did a magnificent job moving from producing one to two Virginia-class nuclear attack submarines (SSN) a year while squeezing more than a million man hours out of the process for each boat. The Virginia-class is being built in blocks of 10 boats, each introducing new features while ensuring quality and controlling costs. Now they are working to hire and train the thousands of additional workers needed just to manage the current program for two SSNs a year while adding production of the new Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine to the queue.

HII and GD might be able to add to their order book more attack submarines, but only if they have sufficient lead-time to improve their infrastructures, acquire the necessary workforce and tooling, create additional production spaces, and contract for the necessary long-lead items. Not only HII and GD, but their entire supply chain, including the makers of nuclear reactors, sonar equipment, engineering systems, and weapons, would have to be spun up.](https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2017/05/12/the_first_signs_of_a_national_mobilization_for_war_are_appearing_111371.html)

&gt;[Simultaneously, logisticians will need to go to the civilian economy and buy what can be adapted there. Adapted does not mean shifting civilian production to military-specification production, because that would take too long. “Adaptation” in such a situation means taking what the civilian economy produces, painting it green, and sending it forward. Some “civilian-like” equipment might be produced relatively quickly. Production of MRAPs (Mine Resistant Ambush Protected – essentially armored gun trucks), for example, surged within a year during the Iraq war. Adaptation also applies to the doctrine needed to fight such a force.  So after six or eight months of combat, the Army’s main combat vehicle might be MRAP gun trucks, but that’s better than nothing.](https://warontherocks.com/2017/08/long-wars-and-industrial-mobilization-it-wont-be-world-war-ii-again/)

Yet there has been commentary by analysts since the beginning of the war asking ""Where is the Russian air force?"", because it's had *much less* impact on the war than was expected. There was an expectation that it would take out the Ukrainian air force and air defenses and then enjoy something close to air supremacy allowing much more impact on the ground battlefield.

I guess we agree about the facts but are framing them differently.

There's a lot of comments out in social media that describe an expectation that Russian forces will be able to dig in and defend nearly *all* of their ground taken.

[],False,,Apprehensive_Sir_243,,,[],,,,text,t2_e99g1w2o,False,False,"&gt; Is NATO at war with Russia?

NATO is supplying arms to Ukraine, training Ukrainian troops and providing ISR. To answer your question, I would respond: direct war? no. war by proxy? yes. I would argue being at war is a spectrum than a simple binary ON/OFF switch.

However, whether NATO is or isn't at war with Russia is a red herring of semantics. In the game theory sense, we are discussing two adversarial actors here and the answer to your question doesn't matter very much.

&gt;Given that Ukraine isn't a member of NATO but NATO is trying to defend it anyways, I'm not sure why it's incorrect to suggest NATO isn't intentionally taking on some level of risk here.

NATO is 100% taking some level of nuclear risk. Any action outside of complete appeasement will take some level of nuclear risk and even with complete appeasement, the risk is still not zero because of irrational actors.

Maybe I should reword my previous comment so it is easier to understand. If NATO's decisions were driven by reducing nuclear risk, they would've did nothing for Ukraine. No weapons, no training, no intel, not even humanitarian aid. However, this is clearly not what has happened because NATO values their interests and relative power over simply minimizing nuclear risk.

Imagine two empty and equivalent pools: a NATO pool and a Russian pool. When Russia invaded Ukraine, they filled their pool up to a height of 1m. In response, NATO would never fill-up their pool more than 1m because they don't want to escalate further. To defend NATO interests, under standard tit-for-tat equivalent retaliation, NATO would fill-up their pool to 1m. However, to avoid even being *perceived* as escalating further than 1m, NATO won't even fill their pool to 1m, instead stabilizing at between 0.6m and 0.8m.

Suppose Russian threatens to fill their pool to 5m (nuclear war). NATO must credibly show that they're also willing to fill their pool to 5m or else, NATO loses on their interests.",9c6b48899ec0ab4d3e01e96a90be642a21f0c40f,True,False,,,,,0,1651333547,,0,{},i6sua0j,False,t3_uevbwj,False,True,t1_i6sodyy,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uevbwj/the_history_of_russian_conflict_behavior_tells_us/i6sua0j/,1651333565,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651304747.0

They still have to actually provide those troops with equipment, but from reports it seems like that is a big struggle already.

Every extra soldier is an extra mouth to feed and bullets to supply at the barest minimum, and that means more trips from more trucks moving all over an already constrained frontline.

I bet the cost per soldier in China is dramatically lower than those nations it is being compared against.

And the same thought can be said for the engineers who design its equipment, and the workers who build the equipment. China is famous for having low wages and being cost effective to produce lots of things.

I bet this skews the ratio of combat power per dollar spent hard in China's favor. And the official numbers have already eclipsed that of Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and India combined.

-------------------

&gt; * …a 7.1 percent year-on-year increase from 2021. 

&gt; * After years of double digit increases in the 2000s and early 2010s, this is the seventh consecutive year that China’s defense spending has grown by single digits.

&gt; * now second only to the United States in expenditures.

&gt; * China now spends more on its military than Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and India combined

&gt; * China’s intentions are three-fold: 1) to build a strong military that is commensurate with both its growing international standing and its national security and development interests; 2) to close the gap between the PLA and the world’s leading militaries; and 3) to compensate for the deficiencies in its military’s capabilities to wage modern warfare 

&gt; * The current roadmap for the PLA… is to make “significant strides in the modernization of national defense and armed forces.” The agenda includes intensifying efforts to modernize military logistics and asset management systems, build a modern weaponry and equipment management system, strengthen innovation in defense science and technology, train competent personnel in the new era, and promote the overall high-quality development of the military 

&gt; * Beijing’s strategic calculus in pushing through another major defense budget increase in 2022 is predicated on the assessment that the nation is navigating an increasingly challenging external security environment. 

&gt; * First, the recently released U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy categorically states that “the Indo-Pacific faces mounting challenges, particularly from the PRC,” and as a result, will remain Washington’s primary theater of strategic focus 

&gt; * Second, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has acted as a catalyst for China as well as many other countries such as Germany, Poland, Sweden, Romania, and Denmark to boost defense spending. 

&gt; * Third, China’s increasing military strength enhances its ability to safeguard its territorial and maritime claims in regions of strategic importance, including the South China Sea, East China Sea, and along the Himalayan border with India, which has been a key priority for Xi.

&gt; * China is likely to continue to steadily increase its military expenditures in the coming years

&gt; * Very little is known about the costs of weapons and equipment produced by the Chinese defense industry or the amount of money allocated to research and development. 

&gt; * The lack of transparency on China’s defense spending raises concern over China’s strategic intentions.

The Army Corps of Engineers found one after another while dredging. The cannons are believed to be from a British ship that was deliberately sunk before a battle.

&gt; * Andrea Farmer, an archaeologist for the Savannah district of the Army Corps of Engineers, said the cannons were most likely from the HMS Savannah, one of several British vessels sunk in an area called Five Fathom Hole. The Savannah was sunk to block the advance of French troops, who were allied with the rebels, in September 1779.

&gt; * “There are historical records from the time period that state it was sunk so quickly that they left everything: the armament, the provisions, pretty much the only thing that was not on board were humans,” Ms. Farmer said.
By the fall of 1779, George Washington was trying to organize an offensive against the British along with the revolutionaries’ French allies. That October, American and French forces assaulted the city of Savannah by land in one of the deadliest battles of the war, known as the Siege of Savannah. But they failed to dislodge the British, and the French fleet sailed for home before the start of hurricane season. The British didn’t evacuate Savannah until years later, in 1782.",0163b66a03b91a21bd2901e386eec81cbed7466b,True,False,,,,,0,1651330246,,0,{},i6sn5tv,True,t3_ublttg,False,True,t3_ublttg,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ublttg/general_questions_comments_pet_theories_and/i6sn5tv/,1651330262,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651301446.0

&gt; * ""Many Chinese experts are monitoring this war as if they are imagining how this would unfold if it happened between China and the West,"" said Beijing-based security scholar Zhao Tong of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

&gt;* ""China probably should think about conducting a much stronger and much more comprehensive operation at the very beginning to shock and awe the Taiwanese forces to secure a major advantage,"" Zhao said, referring to observations from Chinese strategists.

&gt; * ""The Chinese can't have any illusions now that they will be welcomed as liberators in Taiwan and given supplies and assistance,"" he said.

&gt; * Chinese strategists also worry about how Russia is contending with indirect Western military assistance, a factor China would also face in a Taiwan scenario, say two scholars and four diplomats.

&gt; * ""There are a lot of discussions about how China needs to pay great attention to this information domain,"" Zhao said.

&gt; * ""Taiwan would present a far greater logistical challenge than Ukraine, and to ready an invasion force on that scale undetected would be incredibly difficult,"" said Alexander Neill, who runs a strategic consultancy in Singapore.

&gt; * Strategic assumptions from this collaboration, however, are being tested.

Like it or not, if the US intervenes in Taiwan, there is no moral high ground. You are invading a sovereign state to pursue your own national interests. Now that happens all the time but please, stop trying to claim to be some morally superior GOOD GUYS in every damn Hollywood movie. 

Taiwan isn't just a damn face saving issue. It's a matter of national sovereignty. No government will survive in China if they refuse to fight for Taiwan.

People can accept humiliation, but they will fight to the death to defend sovereignty.

&gt;So you are saying that Russia *has incentive* - something as weak as domestic propaganda about Ukraine's attack. Like they need that *after* Ukraine already launched air attacks and ballistic missile attacks at the Russian territory.

A) Propaganda doesn't stop when you meet some imaginary threshold, it is always relevant. B) While there's not a *ton* of propaganda value in Transnistria, there's also not much in the way of effort required. A couple of bombs planted to shore up anti-Ukrainian sentiment isn't exactly a huge investment. 

If you're keeping the option of general mobilization open, and your war aims include Odessa eventually - but not Kyiv - you'll want to justify to the domestic audience why the invasion is continuing outside of the Donbas. Before, a broader invasion made sense under the guise of regime change. That's off the table, so you need some means of justifying a broader war beyond the Donbas.

This seems..... ridiculously high. 250 a week ? 

I don't think ,even absent sanctions, russian can produce 250 a week. Thats 12,500 a year. I am not sure 12,500 T-72s have been produced in the 50 years T-72s have been operational.

Is that meant to be 250 a year ? That sounds more reasonable (albeit a bit high) to me.

For example how is Russia's approach to engaging in warfare affected by its modern status as a major exporter of oil and gas? Does the demographic crisis create time pressures (ie ""now or never"" mentality) that weren't present in previous conflicts? 

&gt;Russia isolated its target by diplomatically maneuvering to deter intervention or negotiate conditions for a limited war.

&gt;A key formula for Russian victory, therefore, is to initiate a war without v
Triggering a counter-balancing reaction by its neighbors, and to plan operations at a time when it is not suffering from domestic instability. 

Don't these principles apply to all states contemplating war?

&gt;Even in conflicts, Russia is set on losing. Its significant internal resources mean that the strategies of attrition it usually relies on can be extended for over a year.

There's no real analysis of what it would take for Russia to mobilise these reserve resources. Eg Michael Kofman has talked a lot about how Russia is experiencing a manpower problem not because they don't have enough men, but because they are very reticent to make the political decisions that would allow them to access more manpower. 

This war was framed as a Special Military Operation which has consequences for what the country is allowed to do in prosecuting the war. Relatively recently, Russia has sought to reframe the war's objectives to focus on Donbass, with operations in the north being dialled down. To go from this to escalating the war in order to better mobilise the state and economy for fighting a war would be a huge political decision.

Ukraine's reactors are the VVER type which use LEU at less than 5%. Ukraine doesn't enrich uranium, rather they got their fuel assemblies from Russia then Westinghouse. Gun-type weapons are generally unsuitable for any modern delivery method.

To build a implosion type nuclear weapon you need plutonium. Plutonium doesn't exist naturally on Earth anymore, it has all decayed. Plutonium is by product of fission and can be obtained in small amounts from reprocessing spent nuclear fuel through the PUREX process. Or in much larger amount from a reactor designed for it, and again using the PUREX process. Although it's much easier/cheaper via a dedicated reactor as there is far less plutonium-240 to deal with. 

To build a dirty bomb Ukraine could just use spent fuel assemblies, as these contain all sorts of long lived highly radioactive isotopes. Detonating a large amount of LEU wouldn't do much as it doesn't emit ionizing radiation. It has to be consumed to be dangerous.

Failures in the Iraq War cost the Republicans Congress in 2006 and the war was effectively over by 2009, with violence down, SOFA agreement in effect and control handed over to Iraqi govt, and US forces massively downsizing force structure until totally gone by 2011.

American involvement in Afghanistan lasted until 2021 because the US effectively stopped trying to win in 2011 and basically cut most of our combatants out by 2014 and it went downhill from there.

I told the other guy that western leaders might not favor a long war, which many indications confirm (economy, energy crisis). The other guy claimed that western leaders are only doing what their electorate wants, which is his way of saying that the electorate wants a long war and the politicians are giving them it. Which is bullshit. 

I showed the surveys and reports about public opinion to show that the US alone, which is the most bellicose of all large powers actively supporting Ukraine, is itself divided on the level of support we're giving **right now**, not asking them to make more sacrifices for a long war. If they're divided right now giving a small amount do you really think those sources just proved they'll be more united next winter? Next summer? Psyched up for the big 2025 summer counteroffensive when Ukraine finally wins back the Donbas? Pumped up for the 2027 amphibious assault on Sevastopol? 

THEY'RE DIVIDED NOW. So no, there is no people's mandate for US leadership to follow through the war to its long term conclusion. 

But despite that if the US govt and other NATO leadership make overt gestures that they are in for the long war then whether or not their populations are is immaterial if its enough to convince Putin and the Russian power elite that even if they mobilize they still lose.

Question: Do you approve of how Joe Biden is handling ukraine

Result: 47% approve 13% not sure 39% disapprove

Then we have:

Question: ""the US aide to ukraine is __""

Result: 42% not enough 32% enough 7% too much 19% not sure

That translates into 74% of respondents who are clearly in favor of support to Ukraine, which is a *substantial* level of support. The first chart seems discouraging, but actually a number of those ""disapprove"" are people who want *more* support or ukraine. Going down the numbers are all pretty high (&gt;70%) for support of sanctions, support for taking in Ukranian refugees etc.

-----

Moving on to the NPR/ipsos poll, they ask a *super* fricking tortured version of the question to produce a negative response

&gt; However, when forced to choose between giving Ukraine all the support it wants, even if it risks wider conflict between Russia and the United States (17%) and giving Ukraine some, but not all, of the support it wants to avoid a larger military conflict between Russia and the United States (62%), Americans are over three times more likely to choose the latter.

Essentially they're asked to pre-suppose giving Ukraine aid is dangerous. Similar to the Pew poll they find only 7% of people want less support for Ukraine.

-----

The newrepublic article worries that Biden is going to suffer for not being ""tough enough"" on Russia:

&gt; Which makes it unfortunate that most Americans believe the president has not been “tough enough” on Russia, according to one poll. Any tougher actions against Russia increase the risks of war, which many Americans also say repeatedly they want to avoid.

Hit the paywall on wapo so I can't comment on that.

---

USA Today also paywalled me

---

Anyway in conclusion, yes America is not ""united"" in their stance on Ukraine, but every single poll I saw indicated that a large majority of Americans support sanctioning Russia and giving arms to Ukraine.

Is biden vulnerable, are the democrats vulnerable? Sure, Joe's polling isn't great. However it seems like he's more vulnerable to accusations of a *weak* response than he is to any kind of isolationist or pro-russian sentiment.

Lavrov denying it today made my gut drop a little. The Russian perspective is awful. They’re ethnically cleansing the Far East of minorities (fodder) and leaving those who are pro-Russian in Ukraine while forcibly deporting those who don’t identify as Russian to the Far East. It’s an old soviet racial idea of filling the region with Slavic blood. The thing is Ukrainians don’t want to go, Russia is trying to erase their nation, identity, and force them into being Russian. It’s deplorable. 

Also if Russia runs out of weapons, they’ll send more men to pick the guns up off of the dead; just like in seemingly every soviet conflict.

If you look at the EU and NATO as organisations, the EU expanded much slower. Why? Because it costs money and effort to get your government, society, and economy up to standards to join the EU. Joining NATO costs nothing. Lithuania and Latvia abolised conscriptions after joining NATO. No one is held accountable to any goals of contribution to NATO or common defence. It creates the interesting situation where an Iowan farmer are being asked to die in a nuclear war if Montenegro is nuked; I don't think most Iowan farmers can point out Montenegro on a map.

When China dragged a float oil rig into waters claimed by Vietnam, Vietnam started by sending ships to ram Chinese ships. When that didn't work, because the Chinese sent more ships, Vietnam closed one eye and allowed rioteers to murder Chinese tourists and expats on the streets of Vietnam. The Chinese withdrew.

It is very clearly written and tracks the debate from its inception to the modern interpretations in the west. And it makes a deliberate attempt to show all the sides and opinions. A must read if you are interested in nuclear strategy. 

Someone was asking for a summary, so here is the conclusion:

&gt; In the end, although the phrase ""escalate to deescalate"" is not used in openly published Russian doctrine, the Russian professional articles above and others make clear that using nuclear weapons to deescalate a conflict is most definitely part of Russia's nuclear toolbox. We are less sure, however, whether Russia's understanding of ""escalate to deescalate"" includes preemptive or preventive nuclear strikes. Patrushev suggested yes; Putin suggested no. The reader must decide. 

&gt; The emergence of the phrase ""escalate to deescalate"" has generated much debate, not only between the U.S. and Russia but also among U.S. and Western military experts. Some U.S. experts object to it because it is not the phrase the Russians themselves use to describe their strategy. Other experts prefer resurrecting the classic Cold War terminology of escalation control. Still others see the phrase as glib and insufficient to describe the unpredictable outcomes a limited nuclear strike could cause.

&gt; These are all fair criticisms. Nothing—certainly no three-word phrase—could fully describe the possible effects of a limited nuclear strike. But the phrase serves a good purpose: It brings attention to an option for using nuclear weapons that remains in the toolbox for both Russia and the United States. It has focused military experts, political leaders and the general public on a dangerous problem that remains with us from Cold War days—the risk of a conventional conflict escalating into a nuclear war.",e09ac4ef79e0e722e7470c0a7e9eef2ba4fedecd,True,False,,,,,0,1651283758,,0,{},i6qqg3z,False,t3_uezlh0,False,True,t3_uezlh0,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uezlh0/is_escalate_to_deescalate_part_of_russias_nuclear/i6qqg3z/,1651283773,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651254958.0

In 1994, the US, UK, Russia, China, and France signed the [Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum_on_Security_Assurances):
""The memorandum prohibited the Russian Federation...from threatening or using military force or economic coercion against Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan, 'except in self-defence or otherwise in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations'...[and] Refrain from the use of nuclear arms against Belarus, Kazakhstan or Ukraine."" 
US and UK agreed to ""Seek immediate Security Council action to provide assistance to Belarus, Kazakhstan or Ukraine if they 'should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used'."" 
According to Stephen MacFarlane, a professor of international relations, ""It gives signatories justification if they take action, but it does not force anyone to act in Ukraine.""
So Russia is inconsistent (breaking its commitment to not attack Ukraine) and ignoring its acknowledgement that the US and UK are justified to defend Ukraine. 
US and UK are consistent by fulfilling both the letter and spirit of their commitments.

Since 2014, the West invested heavily into defending Ukraine.

I know, I fully expect to receive downvotes when talking about these things but whatever, they're black and white facts.

&gt;if Poland was so obviously at fault, how come France and Britain finally declared war when Germany attacked?

France only declared war because Britain did. In fact the French foreign minister supported the Italian proposal for an emergency peace conference from 1st-3rd Spetember. The British replied that they would only support the plan if Germany withdrew from Poland (obviously not gonna happen therefore). The French cabinet was split on whether to go to war with Germany. Once they heard the British had declared war, the pro-British French PM decided to go to war as well. I haven't found any good books about the French side of things, though it seems very interesting how Bonnet and the cabinet didn't really want war, even after Germany had invaded Poland.

The British declared war because they felt they couldn't retreat from their guarantee to Poland and that their prestige would be ruined if they did. However the guarantee to Poland is seen as a pretty big disaster - even Churchill said as much in Parliament when it was given.

There's a lot of communications between diplomats and ministers in the last weeks of August, where some historians then argue either the British totally wanted war or on the other hand secretly wanted a second Munich. Information and quotes conflict quite alot but IMO that's the nature of foreign policy and diplomacy, you can only construct a narrative after the facts (and usually depending on your biases). Chamberlain was quite clear that he didn't want a second munich, that was very much on his mind when trying to support Poland but at the same time prevent conflict.

The main sticking fact is that Poland didn't engage in any diplomacy since receiving the British military guarantee, and on the contrary, in the opinions of Burckhardt, Henderson, Kennedy and a bunch of other diplomats, it was Poland that was aggressive. After all Germany was only demanding that the rights of Danzigers were respected.

&gt;if they had such a good case?

Ironically, even by modern standards they did have a good case i.e. the self determination of Danzig. The alleged false flags supposedly happened on 31st August, the day after Poland ordered full mobilization.

I think this will create a technological seesaw.
As Russia's choice of equipment to field shrinks what it will field will regress in tech-level

Whereas Ukraine's choice of equipment has, so far, only increased in tech-level.

Once Ukraine's tech level increases and when this is shown to be strategically positive it will bootstrap a feedback loop.

New tech will break Russian tech
Russia will field reserve tech, tech-level lowers
Strategic heads will see this and increases Ukraine tech level
And repeat.

Not only is it a feedback loop, it has _exponential_ feedback.

Any practically minded government wants as many educated professionals in their nation as possible, so I'm sure that if the Russian government could snap their fingers and summon 10,000 engineers they would gladly do it. 

What I am less certain of is their tolerance for the kinds of conditions and institutions that produce these people. University students have been the nexus of protest movements since forever, and I could see the Russians preferring to stifle innovation other than deal with it.

I'm going to go a bit out on a limb here to state my own opinion, not really backed up by an extensive study, but I have the impression that anti-intellectualism is relatively more common in Russia than in many other places. To what extent the soviet state either produced or was influenced by that attitude I don't know, but both the Soviet Union and the PRC had purges where ""intellectuals"" were specifically the target.

I'm sure someone who is more conversant in these texts than me can swoop in and correct my ignorance, but I can recall both Chinese and Russian communist party literature that expounded on the virtues of the ""peasant"" over the city-dwelling educated person, suggesting that the peasant had some kind of natural clear-headed sensibility that made them the intellectual superior of the city-dweller.

So while I'm sure the modern Russian state has task forces on improving education and attracting more talent, I can't say as they've made nearly as sincere of an effort to truly foster innovation as the Chinese have. Its worth noting that even though the Chinese have put far more money and thought into this than the Russians have, they still suffer a net ""brain drain"" to the west.",b137eb629c5f2310f357f58c009dcc9618672d22,True,False,,,,,0,1651279785,,0,{},i6qi6v2,False,t3_uetagt,False,True,t1_i6q7res,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uetagt/covert_carriers_evolving_methods_and_techniques/i6qi6v2/,1651279802,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651250985.0

Escalate to deescalate, particularly in the nuclear context, is a phrase that seems to have captured the Western security apparatus’ attention and imagination. Furthermore, it has trickled into public parlance, often causing incorrect assumptions about Russia’s strategic plans for nuclear use. This analysis shows that, while escalation in an attempt to deescalate a situation is certainly within the Russian toolbox, the government and major power players within Russia remain split over what exactly such a strategy would entail. Most importantly, the article highlights the likelihood of a nuclear first strike as part of the escalate to deescalate strategy and Russian statements regarding such a situation. The conclusions are still relatively uncertain, as is so often the case with Russian nuclear policy, but this piece at least dissects the issue and provide a clear understanding of how seriously we should be taking the concept of “escalate to deescalate”.",9d8350797f5ae0de4a8d91eb8bd84d23108ea68c,True,False,,,,,0,1651278936,,0,{},i6qgf1q,True,t3_uezlh0,False,True,t3_uezlh0,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uezlh0/is_escalate_to_deescalate_part_of_russias_nuclear/i6qgf1q/,1651278947,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651250136.0

1. Russia has a ton of SAM batteries. Ukraine is having trouble operating their TB2's with so much Russian Anti Air. Plus, they have to identify launchers to take them down and they obviously move around a bit. 

2. In a normal SEAD campaign you'd fly a bunch of jets around, wait for a launch, and then target the equipment while doing your best to mitigate the launch.  Obviously Ukraine doesn't have the resources to do this.  But could they do it on the cheap? A poor man's SEAD campaign. 

3. The USA supply Ukraine with a ton of cheap model planes. They only need a short range, but they'd have to be fast enough to appear like a real UAV. Fit them with something that will generate a decent RADAR signature. Apparently there is something called a ""Luneburg lens"" that can do it.  And then fly them around the battlefield. Draw out a launch while having the USA in a position to provide coordinates and then fly a TB2 or a suicide drone to the coordinates. 

4. Equally it would provide cover for TB2 strikes on depots in enemy territory. You send the TB2 with an escort which forces them to launch multiple AA rockets against model planes and potentially sneak in your well armed drone to take out the real target.

No, it isn't. Again, it's not a missile system. It's a multiple launch rocket system that can optionally use missiles. Even France, who prefers to develop all of their own hardware, didn't develop their own rocket artillery. They purchased the US M270, Germany uses the M270, the UK uses the M270. None of them operate ATACMS for it. 

The US and the Soviets, later Russia, were bound to the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty(INF) until 2019. The INF prohibited the development of land based cruise or ballistic missiles in the 310–620 mi range, or 620–3,420 mi range. The Precision Strike Missile's range was changed after the US left the INF, some 4 years after it was in development. This is the US Navy is used to deploy long range cruise missiles, the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile(TLAM). Also why the US scrapped the GLCM, Pershing Ia, and Pershing II. ATACMS falls within the INF range. 

Most of Europe, including Russia, are party to the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). This doesn't directly forbid anything but it does politically play a large roll in what countries export in regards to payload and range for surface to surface missiles, specifically to SSMs capable of exceeding 190 miles in range.

And we've probably got a weapon that stops that too! We dedicated our best minds and _literally_ all the money in the world for 50 years to combat the USSR.

I have absolutely no doubt that we have a button that you press and all their artillery pieces go 'nyaarg!' and fall to pieces.

Actually it's probably just HIMARS isn't it?
HIMARS makes their artillery go away. Like, those towed artillery they use?

Obviously it can't make that many tanks, and the tanks in ""storage"" are at best good for parts. But Russia still has some significant hard currency from gas and oil sales.

So who could it buy used tanks from? [This is a list by Global Firepower](https://www.globalfirepower.com/armor-tanks-total.php), but it's basically approaching NCD level of credibility by counting every junk in ""storage"" as a tank.

Anyway, what are Russia's best options?

* nobody's super enthusiastic about pissing off the West by selling Russia huge number of tanks - even China so far isn't doing much more than allowing shell companies evade Western sanctions
* most Third World countries have some truly ancient trash, but then again, if Russia is desperate, maybe it's better to have a bad tank than no tank?
* at least most of them are Soviet-style tanks Russia can deal with

Looking at most likely candidates we have:

* North Korea
* Syria
* Iran
* Algeria
* Cuba
* maybe some Russian ""allies"" like Belarus or Uzbekistan might be unwilling to join, but might be willing to sell some tanks?

None of these options are good, but let's just assume that Putin wants to fight to the last drop of Chechen blood. What are his options?

Obviously it's humiliating af, but at this point it's not something Russia can afford considering.",17b77133569f5be5014bedb86fd6ee567961c622,True,False,,,,,0,1651276905,,0,{},i6qc67q,False,t3_uekbni,False,True,t3_uekbni,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uekbni/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_29_2022/i6qc67q/,1651276919,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651248105.0
