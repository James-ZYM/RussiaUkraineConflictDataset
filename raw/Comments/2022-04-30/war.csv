But in 2014-2015 a spokesperson from Azov said there were about 10-20 Nazis in Azov. I can only hope the **total number** of nazis has gone down.

Yes Azov is using the Wolfsangel symbol but has rotated it to show that they moved away from the old Azov and into a new Azov and came up with a new motto ""Ідея Нації"" that stands for ""Untied nation"", ""national idea"" or ""idea of ​​the nation"" and tbf that does sound a little fascist.

But I do agree with you on ""you think bringing up red armbands can equivocate Russian soldiers to Nazis?"" as the armbands are showing numbers and are showing no symbol.

What the hell are you talking about? Dude you have no clue what so ever. You just don't understand this conflict at all. Biden is NOT expanding America's power. Europe is inviting America to come. I live here, I know. Stop watching Fox, it's not good for you, and their take on this conflict is atrociously bad and wrong.

All of their ex army generals are republican hardliners who are paid to discredit anything the current administration does, because they are not in control. 

Did you know that Russian television shows Fox clips, because they consider them to be detrimental to America? That's when they should consider changing their rhetoric.

Ukraine IS a slaughter house. All the foreign aid is **helping** them, they are saying it themselves so don't pretend you know better because your opinion differs from Ukraine's and it's their war.

Of course Biden wants to bleed Russia dry, and he is not alone. **We all do.** 

  
*I still don't get how people seriously think Ukraine can win.""*

Good thing you're not their commander then. 

They will because every indication is that they already are. Their chief strategist have said so, and British intelligence, as well as NATO and Americans agree. Russia is a spent force in Donbass, they have made zero gains despite 20-30 attacks per day. They have lost nearly 100k troops. 23k fallen and 70K wounded. In a week or two, heavy reinforcements will start trickling in to the front and Ukraine can start thinking about counterattacking.

This is what they are up against. You don't lose to these people because then you die.

It's not going to be a strategic first strike like in fiction. Putin cannot be Czar of nothing. He isn't suicidal. Russia will use one, small nuke and take out a city. The idea being to tell everyone to back off their little war of conquest. Then  NATO has no choice but to respond in kind. If not, then we (and you) become nuclear hostages. How do you think that will play out on the world stage if any rouge nation can pop a nuke and have everyone else just back off or else? How do you think it will play out if North Korea and Pakistan and Iran suddenly sees that tactical nukes are a really useful tool? Then you can start fearing the sky. 

If Russia uses nukes, then NATO must respond and then we are at war with them.  This will all happen here. Thousands of kilometers away from you. 

And this is **not** about beating the drums of war. All of Europe were quite happy paying Russia for it's gas and playing host to their billionaires. 

But then they decided to go full retard. Mine, and everyone else's reaction in Europe since then has been gradually escalating in sync with the atrocities. And they are truly vile. Did you hear about the 40 children who arrived in Poland from Mariupol? The Russian soldiers had pulled their teeth so they could rape them in their mouths. This is their military doctrine. Be as sadistic and vile as possible in order to subdue the population. 

Did you at least scroll through the war crimes Reddit? These are the kind of people we are up against. We are, not you. There are serious rumours that Russia will declare war and fully mobilize on May 9th. If so, then the big war we all grew up fearing will become a reality. I have kids who will be rape victims of they come here. 

There was a post from the 1992 Armenia war in the russianwarcrimes Reddit and it described some documented war crimes made buy Russia there. Among all the be headings and rapes, one stood out to me in particular. ""Girl unknown:  Cut in half, and taken to a hospital with a note saying: Just like you can never put her back together again, so will Nagorno Karabakh never again be a part of Armenia.

What you see in here and on TV from Bucha and Mariupol is standard military doctrine in Russia. That cannot be met with anything other than full frontal assault.

To join NATO, one of the key requirements is that the applicant nation must not have been involved in any border disputes or conflicts inside the last 10 years.    Do you think it was a coincidence that Russia sent troops (don't say they didn't, Putin is on record admitting Russian regular forces were deployed to Donbass) to arm, supply and agitate the separatist forces.

Separatist militias formed because it was in Russia's national interest that they do.  Putin has been desperate to stop the eastwards expansion of NATO, so by creating armed conflict within Ukraine he had achieve precisely that.   How the fuck else does the DNR militia get their hands on a BUK M1?  Did they build it themselves out of paperclips and matchsticks?

No, to be clear, I'm not saying there aren't separatist elements within Ukraine.  There are large Russian speaking parts, and no doubt some would like to cede.  But without Russian support and agitation, it would never have reached the level it did, especially post 2014.  Putin was very angry the people rejected his puppet in Viktor Yanukovych.

However due to the blurry lines, and the US and russias flawed expections to each other (russia wants to be on the same level as the US, same rules, same illegal wars, same buffer zone of states etc, the US is not recognizing russia as a peer (""regional power""""lost cold war""""gas station with nukes""""nato expansion"" etc))

Why do you think Russia is the largest country in the world? By accident or by conquest?

*""OK dude. Do you understand what kind of suffering Russians have faced historically? Do you realize WHY Russians don't like democracy for their state? They had their experiment with it, and many associate it with massive poverty.*

Yes, I do. I also happen to know the kind of suffering they have brought upon others. This is the Russian mindset. They love to suffer and it is their primary export article. And when free nations say 'No' They come to punish. 

You see everyone else from the Warsaw pact also had their experiments with democracy and they made it. Russians chose not to. Their choice, they have to live with it. When Putin is dead we can have this discussion again, and the west can help them become a nation that doesn't have to rely on terror to function. But first Russians have to chose to let go of their ingrained reverse cargo cult group thinking. 

You see they are all, and have always been, led to believe that live everywhere else is just as shit as it is for them. When a politician talks he lies, because that is what their politicians do. This is the reverse cargo cult and this is why they ultimately want Ukraine destroyed and their lands taken. It's success is a direct threat to Russias way of life. 

Fuck their suffering, it is no justification for any of the shit they try to bring upon their neighbors. 

You claim not to be a Russia sympathizer, but then you say this:

**You're attempting to fucking justify this attack**, which means you haven't got a single clue what is really going on. This has never been about strategic thinking. **It's fascist imperialism**. Putin has said so himself, many many times! Did you even read **their** articles? No? 

Do it and then we can have an informed discussion. 

They want to destroy Ukraine. Wipe it off the map. That is not from a ""strategic decision"". That is a blatant land grab. Fucking open your eyes.

*""Do you think if Putin died tomorrow, anything would fundamentally change with Russia's international strategies? If so, I'd argue you are naive.""*

No. That is why I hate Russians. Putin is just the last manifestation in a 1200 year consecutive line of psychotic strong men hellbent on fucking everyone over for their own benefit. And he happens to have record approval ratings becuse these orcs don't know any better. Last I heard it was well over 80%. The whole fucking nation supports this shit. That's why I hate Russians. If they were nice I'd like them.

When there is every chance that Putin will fully mobilize and send his orcs here to kill me, rape my children and their mother. Well. 

*""Plunging Russia into poverty or civil war will make the entire world less safe. What needs to be prioritized isn't revenge, but peace. We need the war to end.""*

There will be peace when Ukraine has it's 2014 borders restored through force of arms because it is the only language these orcs understand. But this will only last when two things occur. Ukraine becomes a NATO member that makes Israel look undefended, and Russia is economically denied the capability to rearm. 

Russia is a backwater with nukes, a mafia controlled gas station masquerading as a country. And they lie about everything, always. A filthy, dystopian shit hole. Leave Moscow, or St.Petersburg and you find nothing but poverty  and wife beating alcoholics. THIS is Russia. 

Have you seen a single second of footage from Ukraine? When they aren't raping women girls, children. When they've executed everyone and drunk all thieir alcohol, they steal washing machines and toilets! 

Because Putin does not give a flying fuck about Russians outside of the big western cities. A civil war and a dissolution is an excellent opportunity at a brighter future for everyone east of Yekaterinburg. 

Have you seen cunts like Solovyov? Day in day out spewing his bile about the 'degenerate, gay loving west' and yet he has villas in Italy. They fucking all do. 

I can only say thank you to NATO and America for calling Putin's nuclear bluff. Sure he can use one, but it will be like setting off a hand grenade in an elevator. He will have his face and dick blown off along with everyone else. 

When Russia is beaten and Ukraine is free, the west can lift all sanctions. In the event that they use nukes, NATO has no other option but to respond in kind. 

Then where are we at? Back to square one. Plus the fact that Russia will be isolated from the west in perpetuity. We will forget they even exist. Then ask yourself, how will they ever be able to afford a gigantic set of pipelines east across tens of thousands of kilometers? 

Have you heard Putin's rat analogy? It's a laughably stupid and simple cliche which he made up. Apparently he trapped a rat in a corner and it attacked. Life lesson, don't trap rats in corners. Unsubtle hint to the world: Don't trap Russia in a corner NATO. So here's my issue with it. Russia isn't trapped. Never was, never will be. Second. **Ukraine and NATO is the rat**. And Putin is the one attempting to trap us. The US lend lease act is the counterattack.

They ve stated several times things like ""our nukes are ready"" (but that is something the us or uk state all the time aswell) and that they would only use nukes if russias existence is at risk.

So on paper, they will use nukes, if they think its about the survival of the russian state and security. They would not have started this very difficult war, if it wasnt about that. But this war is probably far from over, there is substantiated speculation, that soon russia will declare war on ukraine.

The nuclear war analysts from princeton have made the likeliest scenario that russia would use a first strike not on the US or ukraine but poland most likely or czechia. And then most likely a barrackts or depot, not a civilian target. (So between 50 to 10k dead only)

And that would be a (final) warning shot against nato to not support ukraime anymore. Nato (usa) can do 3 things.

A. Retreat, let russia have ukraine and no nuclear war.
B. Respond with nukes which leads to 1500 nukes dropped in the next 8 hours and the end (!) Of human civilization in weeks/months.
C. Respond not with nukes but launch an conventional war against russia. As russias army is very busy with ukraine alone already, severely smaller and underfunded compared to nato, they stand not chance and would use more tactical nukes on enemy formations, which would probably then lead to scenario B in the end.

So i dont think russia would have started this war just hoping for the best, they prepared for the worst. This war is probably far from over, this depends less on equipment but on the will to fight on both sides.

We could see russian desperation in the end escalate to nukes,  but it would certainly takes us by srprise. And they would target nato (in europe, not the us,probably) as the biggest enemy in ukraine is western support.",4e9246ef25ebe40a5a3501e7561668805a0dc8fe,True,False,,,,,0,1651307615,,0,{},i6rpsyx,False,t3_ueqed4,False,True,t3_ueqed4,/r/war/comments/ueqed4/will_putin_use_nukes_against_ukraine_if_he_does/i6rpsyx/,1651307631,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1651278815.0,

OK dude. Do you understand what kind of suffering Russians have faced historically? Do you realize WHY Russians don't like democracy for their state? They had their experiment with it, and many associate it with massive poverty.

Putin has committed an unforgivable act, and the blood of every person raped or murdered in this war is on his hands. But these people don't just do things for no reason. Putin didn't just wake up one morning, twirl his mustache and choose to invade.

This decision was a strategic one, and they have warned us about it for years. If we don't even try to understand the motives of our adversaries, then peace is impossible. 

Do you think if Putin died tomorrow, anything would fundamentally change with Russia's international strategies? If so, I'd argue you are naive.

Plunging Russia into poverty or civil war will make the entire world less safe. What needs to be prioritized isn't revenge, but peace.
