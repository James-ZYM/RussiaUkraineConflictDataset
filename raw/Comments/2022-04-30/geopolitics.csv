In your opinion, is it wrong for any country to engage in actions to prevent any of its regions or groups from declaring independence or allegiance to a foreign country? When the foreign country incites or assists with these schisms to gain another country’s territory and resources, does that affect your opinion? Surely if the only issue is citizens wanting to live in Russia, and not an illegal theft of territory and resources, those citizens can simply move there if Russia will have them?

Is it not Russia who is starving its claimed citizens by refusing to provide (through its own infrastructure or purchase from Ukraine) water for them? By refusing to provide water or pay Ukraine for their water, and further provoking and attacking Ukraine’s infrastructure instead of maintaining diplomatic relations, it sure seems like Russia has abdicated responsibility for the territory and its residents.

If you really think Ukraine is responsible for providing Crimea with water, then would you agree it is right for Ukraine to reclaim Crimea to regain control over the use and maintenance of its utility infrastructure and resources?",203ba0357b007571df737d3dba6a0a86d103287e,True,False,,,,,0,1651363172,,0,{},i6ukewh,False,t3_uf5leq,False,True,t1_i6ucr9t,/r/geopolitics/comments/uf5leq/unanswered_questions_on_the_ukrainianrussian_war/i6ukewh/,1651363188,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1651334372.0

The competing effects are, the strengthening of political will and cooperation in western countries. The long term economic trajectory of Russia being significantly reduced. The collapse of Russias reliability and credibility on the world stage, not only militarily but also politically. Additionally, the US will benefit from a stronger dollar due to the euro being seen as unsafe, increased military sales and increased natural gas exportation to Europe.

&gt; China alone is such a massive portion of the west's trade that, Chinese reduction of western reserves is a major hit.

The west is also a major portion of Chinese trade. I severely doubt China will reduce trade over this in either the short or long term.

&gt; Russia is simply too big and important to kick out of the global economy so you like all things made illegal, you are going to see parallel (""black"") markets emerge.

Russias economy is not 'too big' to kick out. The effect is largely a reduced growth and increased inflation for a few years. It's a significant impact for sure but not a long term problem. Also while there will likely be a black market it will be in no way comparable to trade with Europe for Russia.

&gt; China is 100% going to completely commit to moving off the dollar. Once a parallel market exists, others will participate in it too eroding the US advantage.

Key words is 'once a parallel market exists'. We're a long way off from any other reserve currency being competitive and I seriously doubt the Ukraine war has had any effect on the trajectory of this.

For almost 30 years, the conflict over Transnistria - a russian-speaking separatist region of Moldova - was barely ever a topic discussed on the world stage. But due to the war in Ukraine, the situation has changed dramatically. As soon as the invasion began, various analysts and politicians began to suspect that Transnistria, being located right at the border with Ukraine, may end up playing a role in the conflict. In April, a series of explosions occurred across Transnistria as well, further fueling fears that the war may soon spill over into Moldova.      
Since 1992, the region has been administered by a Russian-backed separatist government, after Russian military units helped the seperatist in a 4-month war against Moldova. This video explores the history of the conflict, the status quo up to February of 2022 and how the war in Ukraine may impact the region.

There is also the additional factor that Russia is running out of places to store the oil that they cannot sell.

If they're forced to close wells, it could take years for them to get that production capacity back online.

Forcibly integrate them into Russia. Prison sentences for those who continue to express pro-Ukraine views and things such as being forced to learn Russian

&gt; Why is the Russian Naval force in the Black Sea still afloat?

Because Ukraine themselves doesn't have the weaponry necessary to cover much of the Black Sea, and training Ukrainian personnel on the use of western systems and those systems then being deployed takes months.

&gt; Should Ukraine and the west offer a face-saving way out for Putin and if so, what could that be?

Nope, impossible. Also, your suggestion that Russia could use submarines to do stuff such as blockade western ports is frankly insane, that's an act of war and would cause WW3. This war can only end in one of two ways: Ukraine surrenders, or the west keeps supplying Ukraine to such an extend that they're successfully able to launch offensive operations against Russian occupied regions, forcing Russia to sue for peace with for example Luhansk and Donetsk being reintigrated with some special rights (full recognition of the Russian language, demilitarised, maybe become a single Oblast) and Crimea becoming jointly administered.

Russia has indeed already lost thousands of young people and will continue to lose thousands more, but a lot of those are people who aren't ethnic Russians and those which are will be replaced by deported Ukrainians.

Not if Russia themselves screws it up.

Demographics effects: a Russian civilian YouTuber (inside Russia) was talking about the brain drain of software devs leaving Russia, and how Uzbekistan is so nice and warm compared to Moscow.  Apparently neighboring former Soviet states that historically provided low wage labor to Russia are now setting up state funded incubators to welcome in the educated young professionals who want to avoid being drafted.   Imagine if the US went to war with Canada, and Mexico started building a ""silicon valley"" but in Cancun. 

Russian state officials are starting to recognize the losses, and are shocked and dismayed and unbelieving. (Meaning they don't have a plan to handle it).  The nightly nuts news in Russia is talking about how nuclear war would be bad, but, meh. We all die eventually.   Three doctors who complained about the state handling of COVID jumped out of windows last year. 6 gas company executives have killed themselves and their families lately.   So either it's so awful to be rich in Russia that executives and professionals are offing themselves.... or something else is going on that *also* makes professions seem less attractive.   It's like they don't want a young professional class to stay in the country. 

According to Peter Zeihan, the Russians never reinvested in education after the fall of the Soviet Union.  The elite in Russia now were educated before 1989, or outside of Russia.  So, according to him, there isn't a deep bench for leadership.   Peter Zeihan also says that Russia is expanding to try to reach borders that are more defensible with a small population. I don't know if I buy that.  My sense is that Putin didn't think there would be resistance, and if he just chose his timing carefully, he could roll on and roll on and roll on.   

What will they do with all those civilians from Ukraine?

They are supposedly adopting the children out to Russian parents. They have offered to trade some back to Ukraine in exchange for POWs.  

I think there is some part of this whole war that's like, I'm not trapped in here with you, You are trapped in here with me. Russia now has a million angry potential subversives inside it's borders.  


Naval: I have been watching peruns analysis on YouTube, and I believe he was saying that after the Moscow sank, the rest of the fleet pulled back farther (making them harder to reach), and they aren't providing the distance cover (with artillery) that the Moscow did.   

The face saving exit for Putin:. He could just declare victory and leave at any time.  The US did it in Iraq and Afghanistan, and whether or not it's true, it's a totally viable strategy that Putin might be headed for.   The original goal was demilitarization and denazification.  He declared that Ukraine has been mostly demilitarized when they pulled back from kyev to concentrate on the Donbas and now doesn't talk as much about denazification.   It seems likely that at some point he will declare the aims have been satisfied and Russian troops can come home, and have a big parade. 

It has been and will be tremendously expensive for them either way.  If they claim territory, they will have to pay to rebuild it and occupy it. Apparently a lot of Russian military was dedicated to occupying previously conquered territory.  they have moved some of the occupation forces to Ukraine, and now people are restive in those places.  A lot of plates spinning for Russia right now.

India is quite powerful today on par with middle powers like Germany, Japan, France etc. What it has is enviable geography, demographics and resources. That's a lot of latent power.

The legacy of colonialism has left India distrustful of the West and it's intentions. However as the older generations are dying off that distrust is going away.

Xi said during the Olympics that the partnership has no limits. Why isn't China sending troops to Ukraine to help Russia? The West or most of Asia isn't going to take China seriously.

**What is Putin planning for the 1 million forcibly deported Ukrainian civilians?**  
Nothing good. They'll be too restive for them to be counted as ""boosting Russia's' population"". Prisoner swaps and then work camps/execution once the war gets even uglier is my guess, and this war has plenty of ugliness left to explore. Ukraine can't enter Russia for a rescue at this point, an operation would lend credence to any Russian false flag operations and half of the West's goodwill to Ukraine has been due to them fighting conventionally in their own territory. It makes them easy to mark out as 'the good guy'. 

Why is that important? Just having a 2000 force of Azov battalion with some Nazis out of an entire military of 200,000 was enough for Russia to run a propaganda campaign and Ukraine to lose support in some segments of the West. If it's obvious Ukraine are conducting operations boots-on-ground in Russian territories, a false flag can then happen and then the narrative gets all muddied and support drops away. Things would have to be desperate for a rescue to happen. 

**Why is the Russian Naval force in the Black Sea still afloat?**  
Despite Ukraine's success with Moskva, it doesn't seem like the kind of action that can be performed any old day they want. The execution and circumstances were remarkable. As for the use of tech from other countries, as stated by yourself, it's still early days. Most of European decision-making seems to be only a few weeks past thinking that Ukraine actually had any chance in this conflict.

**Should Ukraine and the west offer a face-saving way out for Putin and if so, what could that be?**  
Personal opinion - absolutely not. Every instance over the last two decades where Putin has been given breathing space to act rational and back off, he has interpreted it as weakness and doubled-down. It is beyond obvious that any peace struck with Putin still at the helm of Russia would be a false peace that will be broken by him at the moment he feels is most opportune. The nuclear threat doesn't go away if a deal is struck. Putin and his version of Russia do not honour deals. 

The few exceptions would be if perhaps China's Xi negotiated a ceasefire agreement and staked his reputation publicly on it - that would be worth entertaining. But a ceasefire negotiated by Macron or the UN for example would be absolutely worthless. 

**What is the demographic effect of this on Russia?**  
Disastrous, and as you noted things weren't already good. If I was a Russian with any access to external information living in the country, and I realised what the demographics were like and what a long and grinding war we were stuck in, I'd be scared. More than anything, it's the brain-drain overlaid on the top of a shrinking population engaged in full conscription that would concern me. If the gas goes out in Europe, it's a disaster...but there are options. There are no options for Russia going forward if they can't scrape together enough capable energy specialists who want to stick around keeping the infrastructure going. And the health industry was bare *before* COVID. Like you, I don't see a post-war baby-boom happening for Russia. 

It also makes me wonder what on earth Putin had planned post-war. I mean, all territories seized would need to be held and administrated going forward. Held and administrated by who? States as happy to be held to Russia as during the USSR era? 

**Will any other countries see this as an opportunity to reclaim territory from Russia as well?**  
I'll speak only of the few countries I could take a wild guess at. Japan will make sounds about the Sakhalin and Kuril islands but military adventurism is still out of the reach of their constitution, plus they are still playing within the rules-based order for now. Moldova won't adjust their position enough to account for what happens in Transnistria, and are next on Russia's invasion list. If they come up with an immediate agreement with the Ukraine military to operate from their territory...it might count for something. Or they could abandon Transnistria, petition for union with Romania, and that would get them a security guarantee with NATO. But it may be too late for either option.

Things stay exactly the same as they are right now in Chechnya unless Kadyrov actually stops pretending and ventures into Ukraine and gets killed, preferably with as many Kadyrovites as possible. I sense if that was to happen and Chechnya made independence moves, and another year of two war grind Russia's army and population down, then other states would follow. 

While normally I'd cheer this on, this may actually bring a generation of instability to these countries as there may not always be an organised and armed democratic alternative waiting in the wings. It could turn into a strongman punch-up who then turn on their neighbours to carve out a fiefdom.",f08bfaa3081968210340413d92b30afed8b360e0,True,False,,,,,0,1651308596,,0,{},i6rqv9v,False,t3_uf5leq,False,True,t3_uf5leq,/r/geopolitics/comments/uf5leq/unanswered_questions_on_the_ukrainianrussian_war/i6rqv9v/,1651308608,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1651279796.0

That being said, if armed conquest of contested land is allowed rather than the current model of diplomatic meetings carried out at the UN, G7, G20 conferences, a core function of the UN is kaput.

It’s not like these soldiers did it completely alone, for sure there was an order from the top.

You know that Moskva was a relatively old ship with old radar and antiaircraft systems?

3. There is a lot of pride at stake for the Russians. Putin has got the vision of rebuilding the Russian empire in the borders similar to Soviet Union or even bigger. After war crimes in Bucha, I don’t think the peace talks can yield any results.

May 9 will be an important date. It’s the victory day and very important from pov of Russian propaganda. My guess is that Putin will announce a victory of the “special operation” and officially start a war, and announce a draft to the army.

But in reality, china's biggest threat is the US navy and India's is Pakistan. The border territory is also minor in the sense it contains very few people or resources so going to war is highly unlikely and a simmering issue is a problem (more so for China because it gives anti China countries a card to play).

I'd imagine there's aspects of that which don't need to be reconstructed from scratch, such as the compressor stations. Total cost was 1.2 trillion rubles (but I could be wrong on that - figures are coming from [gem.wiki](https://gem.wiki) and various news items so correct me if you've got something better).

Say we halve the time a second pipeline takes and halve the cost of construction. That means 6 years of construction and a cost of 600 billion rubles. Eminently doable in normal times. But here's the headwinds:

\- they'd be attempting construction without overseas technical or engineering talent who have fled the country  
\- they'd be doing it without any overseas capital, and any capital coming from China would have to be small and secretive so it doesn't get sanctioned  
\- every gas executive is under sanctions, impairing their ability to work and source talent  
\- any materials not sourced from Russia would have to be paid in rubles which are struggling to maintain value   
\- construction needs to be done on both the Chinese and Russian sides...one would expect a projected downturn in available young people to train and work on the Russian side, and China is locking down for the foreseeable future (probably til Xi gets his 3rd term)  
\- construction is happening during a pandemic. That doesn't help things speed up
