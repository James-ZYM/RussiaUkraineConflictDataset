&gt;Yet many of those arguments leave out a crucial fact; that this is already a Global conflict, we are already well on our way to WW3.

There were lots of proxy wars during the Cold War and none of them led to WW3. It's a baseless assumption. Why would this war be different, if it continues the way it's going? 

How's this a global conflict? War is fought in only one country. Everyone else is just supporting either Russia or Ukraine.

&gt;We have a chance now to completely neutralize Russia and nobody wants to take that chance.

Because 'neutralizing' a nuclear power by directly attacking its forces would likely lead to nuclear war and several billion deaths and end of life on Earth as we know it. USSR was slowly 'neutralized' by collapsing due to economic and other issues in the long term - no one neutralized it by launching a full-scale attack on Soviet Army.

&gt;What happens in 3-4 years when a bloodied, but most likely reinforced Russian military thanks to China’s alliance attacks another or more countries, most likely NATO countries

Why would Russia attack any NATO country? This was never seriously attempted during the Cold War when balance of power was a lot more in Soviet favor than it is now. Simply, the costs outweigh any potential benefits.

By the way, NATO didn't respond in 1956 in Hungary or in 1968 in Czechoslovakia despite both of those countries being invaded by the Soviets. It's not unprecedented.

I don't understand how we just jump from 'Russia attacks Ukraine' to 'It's WW3 already'.

If Ukrainians don't like Russia (which is completely obvious at this point), Putin will probably be perfectly okay with them being very, very afraid of Russia for the next few decades.

There is a good chance that Putin won't accept a simple agreement with Ukraine and will insist on achieving a clear victory first to somewhat improve Russian military's image (after the debacle of first few days of war) and show they're still a very capable fighting force. I've seen quite a few people online claiming that Russian army is a joke - I'm sure Russian leadership doesn't want to leave such an impression. 

The other issue is that if Russia has to withdraw (from what will be left of Ukraine) after reaching a peace agreement, the implied threat of Russia military response in case Ukraine doesn't follow through with the peace terms must credible.

I hear the warnings of a larger conflict, but we’re already headed in that direction anyway. As much as I can’t stand George W. Bush, his administration paved the way for how to bully Russia into submission and sanctions alone ain’t it. They put destroyers in the Black Sea with semi clear warheads pointed right at Moscow, and despite Putin’s then nuclear saber rattling, he ultimately backed off his then military aspirations. 

A similar approach could be done now. A fleet of Navy Destroyers, and Aircraft Carriers in the Black Sea, amassing of US/UK troops on the western Ukrainian border (meaning about 200,000 troops), along with NATO forces, and a strict “No-Fly Zone” with the intention to shoot down missiles and not actively target aircraft unless absolutely necessary. As much as Putin wags the Nuclear flag, he has to know that for every Nuclear Warhead he is pointing away he has the same pointed right back at him, and he isn’t stupid enough to destroy Russia, because that is what will happen. Moscow would get flattened in retaliation. He doesn’t want that and he surely knows that it’s not just the US pointing Nukes right back at him. France is, the UK is as well. And his now significantly weakened military thanks to the Ukrainians cannot withstand a conflict with the US, UK, and other NATO members. 

I’m sure there are lots of arguments against my points, and  many are sound. Yet many of those arguments leave out a crucial fact; that this is already a Global conflict, we are already well on our way to WW3. We have a chance now to completely neutralize Russia and nobody wants to take that chance. 

What happens in 3-4 years when a bloodied, but most likely reinforced Russian military thanks to China’s alliance attacks another or more countries, most likely NATO countries with China’s backing as China wants to do with Taiwan what Russia is doing with Ukraine save for killing civilians (you never know with China though).

The US were fighting a country with barely a professional army, more comparable to militias than any modern army with an air force, anti aircraft guns and modern warfare in general.
Plus Afghanistan was and is a very divided country that is hardly a nation but more of a bunch of clans that barely stand each other. Meaning they had a lot of allies in the territory.
And we're talking about a country that had all the military and financial support of NATO and that didn't receive any sanctions in the process.

Russia on the other hand is fighting a country with a professional army that had been receiving NATO support for more than six years, including military training and weapons. 
A country that except for the two separatist provinces seem to be very united against the invasion and is receiving limitless amount of resources from the entire west.

Both situations couldn't be more different. Yes, probably the US army would fare better in a similar situation (after all they're the strongest army on earth), but the truth is the USA has never fought a war like the one Russia is fighting in Ukraine since more than 50 years (and probably more akin since WW2).

I don't believe for a second the US would only take a few dozen losses if they were fighting a similar war against a professional army that is receiving limitless resources from the west.
Plus, if the US were receiving the same economic sanctions Russia is receiving, I don't know how the people would take it given that people in the US are way less used to economic hardship compared to the Russians.

[],False,,PitonSaJupitera,,,[],,,,text,t2_3uursvcq,False,False,"Russians originally expected little Ukranian resistance - basically their idea was that when Ukrainians see Russian tanks and cruise missile, most of them will surrender or give up, making it easy for them to quickly crush any remaining defenders (or something like that). They probably omitted destroying airfields because they thought it was unnecessary and they would have to deal with Ukranian SAMs or spend a lot of otherwise expensive cruise missiles. Any destroyed infrastructure would have to be rebuilt, so they probably wanted to avoid having to do that or antagonize the population.

I think Russian leadership has given up on any idea of a total occupation (if they didn't, they really should because it's completely unfeasible). Even regime change is highly unlikely, and cost of performing it is greater than any benefits it might bring them. Ukrainians have shown they won't accept Russian rule and will reject any puppet government.

Best case scenario now for Putin is to compel Zelensky to agree to a neutral Ukraine and accept independence of Crimea and Donbas. Therefore, Russia won't really need airports, especially those in the western half of Ukraine.

Shooting those MiGs might be a bit harder said than done if they fly out from western Ukraine, stay at low altitude and attack Russian forces (similar to what Russian air force is doing) - they won't really be detected by long range SAMs and will only be in range of short-range systems for a brief amount of time. Given that Russians had a lot of their SAMs destroyed, abandoned or captured, I wouldn't be surprised if countering Ukrainians MiGs proves to be somewhat challenging. They certainly have enough equipment to do so, but it might take some time (or maybe it won't if Russians send in their own air superiority fighters, though they would be at risk from Ukranian air defence). 

It's really likely Russia will just decide to stop those plans entirely by destroying most airfields, fuel depots and everything else Ukranian air force would need. This will also ruin Ukrainian commercial aviation, because I'm pretty sure their planes are still in Ukraine stuck in some hangars and even if they survive Russian attack won't be able to operate from destroyed airports.",b43dcef2a34800907dd07c0f362f23a9b4af2a71,True,False,,,,,0,1646773832,,0,{},hzw0jez,False,t3_t0cgvt,False,True,t1_hzvvum1,/r/geopolitics/comments/t0cgvt/ukraine_megathread_all_new_posts_go_here_so_long/hzw0jez/,1646773846,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646745032.0,

Russia and Azeri came to an agreement before the war where Russia would allow the conflict to occur but in return they'd be allowed peacekeeper troops once the dust settles. That's why Azeri didn't keep progressing to conquer all of Artsakh, because then Russia's justification to bring peacekeepers would be lessened; that's why Azeri didn't invade Armenia proper, because then Russia would have a more difficult time turning a blind eye. The other Russian motivation often mentioned is as a warning to Armenia for drifting towards the West.

That's why this Russian Ukrainian war is especially worrisome for Armenia. If Ukraine wins or Russia is too distracted, Azeri will no longer require Russia's permission to wage war, and there'd be nothing to stop it's superior military from completely occupying Armenia proper.

The deal was made to limit how much equipment they could have and how enriched they could make their uranium.  


Of course it doesn't stop Iran from someday making more enriched uranium if they wanted to end the deal. They could just build more centrifuges and continue research into enriching uranium further than they ever have before (as they are now). But the deal certainly was not ""kicking the can down the road"" or ""still allowing them to develop nuclear weapons""

  
People here seem to be forgetting that much of the deal was about internal Iranian politics, not just X number of centrifuges and Y% enrichment.  
Obviously its not this simple due to the rules within Iran about who can run for parliament and whatnot, but if a more pro-western leadership is seen as having won gains in foreign policy that improves the lives of Iranian citizens, they may start voting in more and more pro-western politicians. It may take decades, but over time normalization of relations can create a populace in the country that becomes unwilling to go back to the old ways and willing to fight it.

[],False,,DrIGGI,,,[],,,,text,t2_77fli,False,False,"To me it seems like the only sane way out of the war is when Russia and EU/US/Ukraine come to an agreement. Sanctions against Russia might hurt them in the long term, but for now it doesen't seem like Russia is even thinking about bending over. Russia's response rather seems to be the old ""eye for an eye"". The next threat - to stop delivering any gas through Nordstream 1 - seems to show exactly this and the next winter is already on its way with a few months left for the EU to become completely independant from Russian gas, so basically impossible. While everyone is filling his own gas reserves to prepare for the worst case scenario it is going to be a hard hit for the EU economically.

Since negotiations between the West and Russia are heading nowhere but the wrong way and Ukraine getting more determined day by day in not giving up and fighting back to the last drop (I'm sure there would be no acceptence for a puppet if russia managed to take out the currently governing heads, but rather partisans) it seems at least worth a try to take up China's negotiation offers. China's BIP is 10x higher than Russia's, the economical ties between both are huge and growing even faster than ever before which also means that Russia is basically dependant on China and thus more likely to listen to them. China has not aligned with Russia on the UN votings but abstained. They even condemned Russia for its invasion and seem to be the only major super power that comes close to a ""neutral"" position in this conflict.

So why is at least the EU not talking with China? The US doesen't want that, this is clear because China is without a doubt the greates threat to it economically wise. But why isn't the EU at least trying to get into talks with China? I've never seen this question even being asked during this conflict. Is this a ""tabu"" or a red line the US doesen't want the EU to cross? What's the alternative? If Russia stops delivering gas to europe the biggest short term alternative seems to be China again. So if all of this points to the direction of China, what is holding the EU back from taking that step? Is it the Hong Kong–Mainland China conflict? Does it fear that China is not an ally to be trusted or is it because it would break the trans atlantic ties?

Or probably the most important question: Does upholding an ally (which is also Russia's biggest foe) that is heading torwards an isolationist direction even make sense in times of resource dependency?

[],False,,RazorMilkshake,,,[],,,,text,t2_cql0gc9v,False,False,"**What is the game theory on Putin and tactical nuke use in Ukraine?**

I've been trying to rationally and neutrally analyze the game theory of Putin's use of small tactical weapons in Ukraine.

Here are my reasons:

- Putin has already spread propaganda that USA has been supplying UA with uranium and what not. He has mentioned biolabs in Ukraine and that Ukraine is making a ""dirty bomb"" and this is good groundwork for potential false flag nuke attack on Russian soil. So Russians could stage a small attack on a military target using some crappy mini-nuke and say it was Ukrainians and they have to retaliate.

- The maximum negative impact of sanctions has reached is maximum or near it, therefore it's not like there could be any more sanctions. The west is out of instruments.

- A military retaliation from west is unlikely as they do not want to start actual NATO - Russia war. Germany would never allow it, especially not over Ukraine.

- If he uses a very precise tactical nuke which at first wouldn't even be clear: is it a nuke or not, hitting Zelenskiy's headquarters, for example, then this would shock the west and give Putin another instrument to threathen western countries to have his way or else.

- It would put Putin in history books as second case of nukes being used in world. (doubt this is that important, he will already be in history books).

What is he losing?

Not much. If for some reason (under 5%) NATO decides to take military steps in retaliation, then it's NATO-RU nuclear war, which means end of northern hemisphere. In this case China might come out as a winner.

What is he to gain?

Seems that much more than he is about to lose.

So this helps me conclude that there is a high chance of him actually using such dubious tiny tactical nukes to take out Ukraine's headquarters in Kiev.

Where am I wrong in these calculations and what do you think would be the likely unraveling where such scenario take place?

What other scenarios could take place?",4b27abfc897059725d2222b9a294914ee9e3bda3,True,False,,,,,0,1646735983,,0,{},hztmfhx,False,t3_t0cgvt,False,True,t3_t0cgvt,/r/geopolitics/comments/t0cgvt/ukraine_megathread_all_new_posts_go_here_so_long/hztmfhx/,1646736032,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646707183.0,

* The reputational loss of attacking a sovereign nation is independent of how large the country is. Russia would face the same barrage of sanctions had it invaded Latvia. But the payoff of success is 20 times smaller though
* Ukraine, Belarus and Russia are seen as core territories by Russian nationalists. It's somewhat odd to us living in nation states, but something like 75% of the people who consider themselves Belorussians actually don't speak Belorussian at home - they speak Russian. Similar figures for Ukraine are subject to some politicking, but I've seen figures lose to 30-40%. Russia, Belorussia and Ukraine used to be called Big Russia, White Russia and Small Russia in the 19th century. None of that applies to Baltics

Unfortunately this is modern history so every political group uses an acronym. This can be difficult for beginning readers because here, the acronyms are incredibly similar. 

Here might be a list of helpful terms. 

ELF: Eritrean Liberation Front: The original militia group that fought for Eritrea independence. Essentially Eritrea had been separated from Ethiopia following Italian colonisation, but Ethiopia wanted it back after WWII. They were allowed to get Eritrea in return for having a federation between Ethiopia and Eritrea, but the Ethiopians immediately broke their promise and ruled Eritrea directly as a province. The Eritrean Liberation Front formed as a result, fighting for independence. They would outlast the Ethiopian empire, going on to fight the Derg, a communist junta. The Derg sought to solve the ethnic minority problems by effectively bringing everyone under a common set of directives and renaming the provinces by numbering them instead of giving them names. They also suppressed minority autonomy movements while promoting cultural assimilation into Amharic, only inflaming the war.

EPLF: Eritrean People's Liberation Front: These were originally just a radical leftist faction that split off the ELF, led by Isaias Afewerki. They would be trained by China, which back then was looking to increase its influence in Africa politically. The EPLF would fight the Derg, but also the ELF for control of Eritrea. Because Tigray and Eritrea are quite similar ethnically speaking, Eritrean rebels had long coordinated with Tigrayan rebels, and the EPLF was no different. They teamed up with the TPLF against their common enemies. The Derg eventually weakened following Gorbachev's foreign aid abolition reforms, allowing the EPLF to prevail in Eritrea after defeating the ELF. Following the Derg's demise, the EPLF were able to get the Americans to push for an Eritrean independence referendum. Because by this point the EPLF had monopoly of force and were the only major political player left, they easily controlled the government, with Afewerki himself becoming President. However, lingering border disputes would lead to the Ethiopian-Eritrean War, resulting in Ethiopia occupying some territories. The EPLF technically changed into the  People's Front for Democracy and Justice(PFDJ) during the period immediately before independence, but they can be regarded as versions of each other. After the war, Eritrea and Ethiopia still squabbled over the border even after an ICJ ruling, which had effectively allowed the Eritrean government to continuously declare states of emergency that give President Afewerki an immense amount of power. 

TPLF: Tigrayan People's Liberation Front. The Tigrayans had long faced discrimination by Ethiopian governments, who tried to get all their citizens to assimilate into the Amhara culture of the Ethiopian political elite (Despite the Tigrayan branch of the imperial house taking over briefly in the Zemene Mesafint political crisis of the late 19th century). Faced with new oppression from the Derg, who tried to completely remove ethnic identity, the Tigrayans slowly formed armed organisations to resist the oppression. The TPLF in particular formed from Tigrayan leftists who had previously opposed the government. They fought a long insurgency against the government, helped by the mountainous terrain. The TPLF would fight alongside the EPLF, helping each other evade government repression.  The Derg, a hardline communist group, survived as long as the Soviets continued to provide funding. But once Gorbachev stopped providing aid , they started to run out of resources. The TPLF started advancing, backed by popular sentiment in Ethiopia. The TPLF had made a policy U-turn in the sense that while they originally only aimed at the liberation of Tigray, they had decided to take over all of Ethiopia. They created new parties for other ethnicities that shared their opinions, to construct the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Defense Front (EPRDF), which took over Ethiopia after the Derg gave out. The TPLF proceeded to monopolise power through the EPRDF, appointing Tigrayans to all the important positions of government. Any opposition that did arise was either swiftly dealt with or too insignificant to challenge them anyway. The TPLF had opposed Eritrean independence, wanting to preserve the Ethiopian coastline, so used an ongoing border dispute to launch the Ethiopian-Eritrean War. Despite the superior manpower of Ethiopia, they were only able to advance a part of the way, before a ceasefire was declared. Though the Ethiopians pulled back, they occupied the disputed territories, refusing to return them even after the ICJ ruled that Eritrea rightfully owned them. The TPLF, as leaders of the EPRDF, were the ones who ordered the intervention in Somalia. They also organised a proxy conflict against Eritrea and Sudan. They were only ousted as a result of widespread Oromo and Amhara protests that led the government to step down. The new Ethiopian government were led by the Oromos of the EPRDF, which reversed the long-standing power dynamic. The TPLF refused to give up power, clinging on to Tigray and trying to declare the government illegitimate over COVID-19 related election postponement. The contest of power between the Ethiopian state and TPLF is essentially what is at the heart of our present war.

The Tigrayan War can be characterised as an internal war with foreign extensions.",70f2e46f3bd5e4874afe746c5f85a976b86a37cb,True,False,,,,,0,1646722630,,0,{},hzt677g,False,t3_t597fe,False,True,t1_hz5r366,/r/geopolitics/comments/t597fe/why_did_eritrea_vote_against_in_the_draft/hzt677g/,1646722643,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646693830.0,

&gt;Furthermore, I have no idea where this claim that Russia expected to take Kyiv in three days comes from. General Millie said something to that effect, but the battle plan the Ukrainians captured showed Russia expected the first phase of this invasion to take 15 days

Here is why people thought Putin expected to take Kyiv very quickly.

[Putin Thought Ukraine Would Fall Quickly. An Airport Battle Proved Him Wrong.](https://archive.ph/N94dg)

The theory is based on air assault at the Hostel Airport on the first day.  it's a decapitation strike.  Its a gamble, and most likely going to fail, but if there is a 10% it will work, it saves billions of dollars

The battle plans could be planted by the Russians. We don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;One of the issues here is most western analysts know nothing about Russian military doctrine. It is Russian practice that if they encounter resistance, they will exit the city, encircle it, and bombard it with heavy artillery and their MLRS. After that, they take their tanks to the center and radiate outward. That's what they are doing. Americans don't do that, so they have no idea what it looks like.

Well, the Ukrainians have served in the Soviet military, so have many Eastern Europeans. So the Americans don't talk to their NATO counterparts? You seem to think Russian military doctrine is a secret that only you, who picked up a book from the library can understand.  Military officers over 50 in the US understand the Soviet/Russian way of fighting because that is what they prepared for during the early part of their careers.  People who lived during the Cold War that is all they thought about, were the Soviets. 

[Here is the paper you are talking about.](https://www.armyupress.army.mil/portals/7/hot%20spots/documents/russia/2017-07-the-russian-way-of-war-grau-bartles.pdf) Released by the US Army Press.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; It is Russian practice that if they encounter resistance, they will exit the city, encircle it, and bombard it with heavy artillery and their MLRS.  After that, they take their tanks to the center and radiate outward. 

They could easily be lured in and wiped out with anti-tank weapons. That is what happened to them initially in Grozny.  After [failing with the initial assault](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA394517.pdf) (page 3). They adopted the following

*  All approaches to the city must be sealed off while detailed reconnaissance proceeds.
* Key installations and buildings on the outskirts of the city must be taken once artillery has suppressed defenders and assault positions have been occupied.
* The city's residential, industrial and central sections must be taken successively.
* Trapped enemy units must be eliminated, mines cleared, weapons collected and military control and curfew established.

The tactics that you suggest are outdated, especially given the Ukrainian military is armed to the teeth with anti-tank weapons. The question is are the Russians following what they learn in Grozny?  

Here is another note (page 3)

&gt;Since the battle for a city continues non-stop, the Russians learned that they needed fresh troops and adequate reserves. Soviet doctrine called for a 4:1 advantage in troops for urban combat. Some 60,000 Russians and 12,000 Chechens fought in Grozny, yet the Russian's 5:1 advantage was sometimes not enough, because they had to guard every building that they took.

In the Battle of Marawai, the Philippines in 2017 it took 6000 Philippines Soldiers and Marines to retake the city against 1000 ISIS militants (it took 5 months). How about Mosul in 2016? Unlike Gorzy and these encounters, the defenders had no airforce and no anti-aircraft weapons (ie no planes were shot down in any of these battles).

The Russian Army doesn't have enough soldiers to take and hold those cities according to their own doctrine unless they add a lot more troops. The second question is how encircled are those Ukrainian cities? 

 

&gt;In the long term, Russia may get what it wants out of this. I suspect they will take the donbas. Crimea is just gone. They will demand a neutral Ukraine with no NATO weapon systems.

To be honest from a US perspective, does it matter? Maybe. How does it influence US strategy in Europe? Well, the Europeans have increased military spending.   Do you think a sanctioned Russia will be able to invade Poland? The Americans ironically got what they have been arguing with the Europeans for close to two decades, which is increased military spending.  Some of these military assets will make it to Asia.",feb312b25e7f388a2d5c5564d64f2979b31ae2da,True,False,,,,,0,1646719261,,0,{},hzt1d0d,False,t3_t8v8wz,False,True,t1_hzqpycw,/r/geopolitics/comments/t8v8wz/top_russian_ukrainian_diplomats_to_meet_thursday/hzt1d0d/,1646719274,1,True,False,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646690461.0,

And it is putting the burden of de-escalation on the victims of aggression. Here in Taiwan, we get the same thing from people suggesting our leaders stop ""inflaming tensions"" with China while they harass and threaten us on a daily basis.

You generally don't see a lot of serious consideration of these kinds of strategies because they are not novel and are proven to be ineffective not just in historical examples but in daily life examples that most people have encountered in social and workplace situations. It's just basic human psychology. It doesn't work.

People who fashion themselves to be compassionate and non-violent should at least attempt to put themselves in the shoes of people who have had their country, their neighborhoods and their families seriously threatened or outright attacked. Personal safety, national security and national sovereignty are basic human rights that come first, before anyone should feel compelled to sit at a table with aggressors. Would people ask the Palestinians to negotiate with the Israelis before their basic human rights have been upheld? Mearsheimer should ask himself the same question.

What you mentioned that is worth considering is ""geopolitical realities and repercussions"" and that pert of Mearsheimer's analysis is what I find to be the most interesting aspect for discussion. His geopolitical realities are that Russia has more determination than Ukrainians, that Russia has no imperialistic intentions with Ukraine and that appeasement is the only solution. I find these to be unsupported assumptions. People also make the claim that Taiwan will get steamrolled by China and that Taiwan and the rest of the world will be beholden to China economically forever and that we have to accept those geopolitical realities and I find those to be unsupported as well.

One point that leads me to be skeptical of any breakthroughs is that America may not offer good enough terms for Maduro to accept. Washington is not completely immune to domestic opinion, which has tended to be predisposed against Maduro's perceived autocratic rule. With there having been an exodus of Venezuelans to America, they may express opposition to any rapprochement with Maduro without significant liberalisation, if at all they accept his continued tenure. This is very much in line with the Cuban-American population's voting patterns. There will also likely be widespread conservative rallying against any compromise with  Venezuela even now, due to the ideological divide. With mid-term elections around the corner, there will be a strong incentive for policymakers not to pursue diplomacy at the expense of public opinion, even if they are personally inclined towards reconciliation. Certainly I believe that politicians like Manchin will be treading a fine line in trying to court their voters. America in my view will be unlikely to abandon its desires for liberalisation and support for Guaido, which after all serve as good bargaining chips for concessions. 

Maduro and his Chavista supporters are however unlikely to accept any arrangement that would jeopardise the survival of the current Venezuelan government. That would at best set back their political platforms  and at worst lead their own detention. Moreover, they deem themselves legitimate authorities and will not be too happy to removed. Maduro would likely desire some kind of guarantee from America that Venezuelan sovereignty be respected, but that would tread on the toes of Juan Guaido's government. From Maduro's perspective, it would be of no use to concede power for short-term survival if it cannot ensure Venezuela's long-term continuance anyway. Besides, renouncing Russia now would entail a dislocation of their diplomatic network that would at least temporarily leave them isolated, allowing America to better strongarm them. Venezuela therefore requires some surety that America would absolutely support them in the same way they back the LDP of Japan.

Every day that grinds on, Russia's resources are strained more and more and Ukraine receives more and more foreign aid.

With a conventional military victory growing increasingly costly, and the economic and political pressures continuing to increase, Russia will likely sue for peace at some point.

Allowing this conflict to continue until it reaches a decisive conclusion is bad for Moscow. What happens if Ukraine throws the Russian forces out of Ukraine proper?

-Sun Tzu

I don't think the Russians were trying to appear weak.  Quiet the opposite; Russia was desperately trying to convince everyone that they are very strong, and very scary.

Before the Ukrainian invasion, everyone believed that Russia was strong.  Everyone thought that they had the 2nd or 3rd best military in the world, and that Ukraine was going to be stomped.  In fact, the Russia strategy banked on this.  They drive straight at Ukraine under the assumption that the same thing happened in Georgia that happened in Ukraine.  In Georgia, the government promptly fled the capital and surrendered when Russia pulled the same sort of ""peace keeping"" invasion.  The ""peace keeping"" operation was finished in the week with little fighting.

In Ukraine, Russia tried this same strategy.  The difference is that the Ukrainian people were more prepared to fight (though still unprepared) and, perhaps most importantly, the Ukrainian people had Zelenskyy as their leader.  Zelenskyy, as it turns out, appears to be one of the greatest democratic war leaders... maybe even THE greatest democratic war leader to ever draw breath.  Zelenskyy's decision to stay in Kiev and rally the people exposed Putin's autocratic Russia as the rotting fraud that it is.

Russia gains absolutely nothing by looking weak.  Russia wants to look like it is strong and can sit in Ukraine forever.  I don't think that this is Russian propaganda made to make Russia look weak; this just an actual honest assessment of the rotting hulk that is Putin's well corrupted Russian army",6a0fabe2e20fb77de2719661a29ab074c9b811c5,True,False,,,,,0,1646700632,,0,{},hzs0ey4,False,t3_t8o9og,False,True,t1_hzp7nko,/r/geopolitics/comments/t8o9og/this_war_will_be_a_total_failure_fsb/hzs0ey4/,1646700647,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646671832.0,

Only among western media outlets and analysts. Everyone I've watched out of Africa, the Middle East, and mainland Asia (minus china and russia, I don't watch them) is not saying Russia is losing. That's just us. Everyone else is calling it a ""slow advance"". 

One of the big issues here is that most people are only viewing this from a western perspective. Through another set of eyes, this looks very different.  Most of these outlets in the US and EU have a bias, and that's ok. It's natural, I sympathize with it, but the problem is that bias sometimes colors how we view the facts. Furthermore, the US government does have a reason to misrepresent the facts just like the Ukrainians and Russians do. 

Let's think critically here: if Russia was losing, why would Zelensky be demanding a no-fly zone? The level of anger and desperation I've been seeing out of Ukrainian government officials in the last three days of appearances has been ramping up. If Ukraine was winning, that would not be the case. Even the level of desperation out of the US has been pretty evident. If something is too good to be true, it likely isn't true. We all know the saying. I get what everyone wants out of this, but it's unlikely to turn out that way and instead of deceiving ourselves about the world, we need to do our best to see the world as it is and prepare ourselves for the most likely outcome.",810b3fa140976c8e5c7cdf33173b649a9af39a17,True,False,,,,,0,1646699623,,0,{},hzry87z,False,t3_t8o9og,False,True,t1_hzqxhu7,/r/geopolitics/comments/t8o9og/this_war_will_be_a_total_failure_fsb/hzry87z/,1646699635,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646670823.0,
