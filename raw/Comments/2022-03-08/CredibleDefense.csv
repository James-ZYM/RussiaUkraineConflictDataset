I'm not going to spend an hour going through that YouTube video, but if it is what you describe, people saying that Ukraine stands a decent chance against Russia, then you are just confirming what I said; no is out there saying that Ukraine is about to have some sort of bloodless victory over Russia.  ""Ukraine can win"" is an entirely different statement than ""Ukraine can win bloodlessly"".  

Everyone understand really does understand how bloody this could be.  There isn't anyone even vaguely credible out there running around saying that Russian sieges of Ukrainian cities are going to bloodless affairs that end up with Russia meekly going home.  Everyone agrees that the result of Russian siege and occupation of a Ukrainian city is going to be bloody and brutal for all involved.  

It's just a pure strawman to say that anyone credible out there is saying that this isn't going to be anything less than bloody and awful.

I'm sure it was much the same elsewhere.  Surprise, followed by some casualties, desperate fighting to withdraw in good order.  Once the Russians began to penetrate into the country, infantry ambushes would have been effective in slowing them down.

The Ukrainian Army has conducted some limited counter-offences and have even retaken a city or two.  It's possible that this is all infantry attacks, but it probably involves some of their armored units too.  As u/Ararafufufu mentioned, the closer you get to Russia or Belarus, the more vulnerable you get.

I've seen a narrative emerge over the past few days which suggests that Russia's massed troops were intended as a ""bluff"" to force a diplomatic solution to Russia's concerns, but when diplomacy was rebuffed Russia was tipped towards invading.

[The linked article](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/russia-s-ukraine-invasion-may-have-been-preventable-n1290831) provides as good a summary as any.

Simplified; Russia was determined to exercise a veto over NATO involvement in Ukraine, either diplomatically or militarily. The US then elected to have the veto be exercised militarily.

What I find appealing about this narrative is it helps explain why the Russians ultimately seemed so unprepared for an expedition launched in a time and place of their choosing. If ""plan A"" was diplomacy at the barrel of a gun, and ""plan B"" was to actually invade, perhaps plan B was not fully considered and the objections raised internally were swept aside.

Because the latter is true, it will resist direct NATO intervention in Ukraine, which opens the aforementioned infinite possibilities for escalation.

[],False,,othelloblack,,,[],,,,text,t2_llyivao,False,False,"Lots of initial thoughts:

1 its a very good sign perhaps a turning pt. in this war. The US would not be going to all this political arm twisting if it thought this was going to be  waste. Its a risk for Poland in many ways, a risk for US credibility w/ its allies if this doesnt work, and of course a risk of escalation of war.  

I believe the defense dept/CIA think its a really good idea and perhaps a war winner otherwise they wouldnt be risking all this. 

2. Combined with other several other ongoing issues suggest this is basically US calling many of the shots. The fact that UKR has made a number of successful counter attacks in the face of a first line military w/ air superiority is really striking. Can you imagine that happening in Iraq or Kuwait? b) UKR taking out many RUS airplanes and rotor types. c) whats the toll of RUS generals now? 3? that's not a coincidence, that's not some UKR guy sitting in the woods taking shots at what look like officers. That's the US identifying and calling in coordinates on these guys. Theyre obviously reading RUS communications. d) lack of RUS air dominance. Not sure exactly why but there must be some massive jamming of the airwaves going on as well as all the SAMs, etc being successful.  THis is clearly a proxy war. 

3. Heres the statement on the Axios site linked above: 

""Russia's Defense Ministry had warned on Sunday that any country that allows Ukrainian-operated airplanes to use their soil to attack the Russian military could be considered a participant in the conflict""

But not an Act of War? Maybe something was lost in translation so we can be sure. But RUS is stopping short of calling this an act of war? 

One has to guard against being overly optimistic especially in wars where emotions are always running high and often vary. I think this is a very crucial event in this war and I think how RUS responds to this should be watched carefully.

Poland is now confirming that it's transferring its fleet of Mig-29s to the USA, in exchange for backfill of F-16s from the USA. Poland is expressly not limiting what the USA may do with the tranche of Mig-29s. USA itself does not operate the type, and will certainly be looking for a new owner for these Polish aircraft. We can speculate about who that new owner might be. It could be anybody! Unfortunately we have no way to know. As a hypothetical, however, let us imagine the new owner will be ""Ukraine"".

What does this mean operationally?

* Do the Polish jets have NATO alterations or equipment which the UA pilots need to be trained up on?

* To what extent can UA keep the jets safe on the ground?

* What about weapons stocks and logistics? I assume UA itself has a limited supply. Will weapon supplies from Poland also be transferred to the USA along with the jets?

* I assume UA would not want to fly them into areas with much hostile SAM coverage. How much will this limit their use?

Russia's problem is that even a win is a defeat. Sure they could level everything and install a puppet government, but what happens after that? No puppet government would survive long without a *massive* occupying force that it's unclear whether they could maintain or likely fund in the long run. The Ukrainians know that any insurgency would continue to be well funded and armed by the US and the EU, and those efforts can be funded far longer than Russia is likely to be able to fund an occupation. Ukraine is a big country, so even if the cities are leveled there's still plenty of places to hide. Ending hostilities now and reverting to the status quo is actually more advantageous to Russia than it is to the Ukrainian state and culture, which would still be under an existential threat. Russia would in effect achieve many of its objectives, destroyed much of a neighboring state, and suffer comparatively minimal consequences for it. That will have huge geopolitical repercussions, particularly when dealing with China.

&gt;In those 8-10 years Ukraine could be armed by the west much more than it has been here. Also in that time the EU may have rearmed, and who knows what might have changed in Russia by then. 

You have to keep in mind things can change in other, less favorable ways to Ukraine by then as well. The EU might abandon them, the world might get distracted by China, etc. etc. The way the 2020's are going, Ukraine being in a better position then isn't close to a sure bet. Particularly since Russia has a loooong history of imperialist designs on Ukraine they have no reason to think they'll abandon (not to mention the genocide in living memory).

Putin is the guy at the poker table who will put you all in pre flop if they just have an ace. Ukraine has a small pair and is calling Putin's bluff, because if they don't they'll just get bullied out of blinds and get weaker and weaker waiting for a better hand that might not come.",84a4fa1e40bb8c78ea9814b3df67c102f81971d5,True,False,,,,,0,1646775739,,0,{},hzw4vwr,False,t3_t9jte6,False,True,t1_hzvw6on,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t9jte6/a_ukrainian_insurgency_will_be_long_and_bloody/hzw4vwr/,1646775756,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646746939.0

Budgetary About-Face: Germany Goes Big on Defense Spending

A New Era in BerlinGermany Goes Big on Defense Spending

For years, Germany has starved its military of money. But on Sunday, Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced massive new defense spending. DER SPIEGEL has learned what the money will be used for.

Whenever things get serious, the chief of defense, Germany’s senior-most military officer, calls a meeting of the Military Command Council, the most powerful body of Germany’s armed forces, the Bundeswehr. The most important generals and admirals in the country then gather in a bug-proof room at the Defense Ministry in Berlin for a face-to-face.

Such a meeting was called for Monday afternoon, and this time, Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht, a member of Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats (SPD), joined the group as a guest. It was a clear sign that she and her top generals had some difficult decisions to make.

ANZEIGE

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has completely upended the fundamental constants of German security policy. German troops are being rapidly sent to Lithuania, Romania and Slovakia to reinforce NATO’s eastern flank. At the same time, six German warships have set off to strengthen the alliance’s northern flank.

And since Sunday, the country’s military leadership finds itself facing a problem that they didn’t expect at all. The country’s defense forces, which have struggled for years to make ends meet, suddenly has money. A lot of money.

In his speech on Sunday to a special session of German parliament, Scholz announced emergency funding of the German military to the tune of 100 billion euros while also pledging to boost defense spending to above 2 percent of gross national product.

The idea of dumping a significant quantity of money into Germany’s ailing armed forces has been around for some time. Several months ago, military planners and Defense Ministry bean counters developed a number of confidential briefs for distribution among political party leaders who were involved in negotiation Germany’s governing coalition at the time.

It was an almost desperate attempt to open the new coalition’s eyes to the deep problems facing the Bundeswehr. Not that anyone in the ministry thought the move would actually work. It seemed merely like something that needed to be done despite the almost certainty of failure.

But Russia’s aggression has now completely reversed years of German thinking about its military. In order to send a strong security policy message, the Chancellery pulled out all the old briefs. One of those was of particular importance: a confidential, six-page brief from Oct. 26 seems to have been particularly persuasive to Scholz and Finance Minister Christian Lindner, a member of the Free Democrats (FDP), the business-friendly party which is part of Scholz’s coalition government along with the Greens.

DER SPIEGEL has learned that the memo proposed a special fund for the Bundeswehr worth 102 billion euros. The memo argues that complex and expensive defense projects almost always require several years to complete, making it essential that military planners have long-term funding in place.

Because the German budget is renegotiated every year, however, such a planning horizon has been difficult to come by – especially because allotted money that hasn’t been spent by the end of the year is essentially withdrawn. Should a large defense project run into delays – which they almost always do – the money has to be spent on something else. Or it is lost.

ANZEIGE

A special fund would solve this problem and significantly extend the military planning horizon. Because the German military has been forced to be so parsimonious in recent years, there are a huge number of major investments that have been placed on the back burner. The new funding will get things moving forward.

According to the memo, the Defense Ministry hopes that once the Bundeswehr is brought up to speed with the sudden injection of the 100 billion euros, daily operations and the numerous smaller upgrades could then be financed with the normal defense budget. But even that budget would have to be significantly boosted in the coming years to over 2 percent of gross domestic product.

The memo also provides a list of projects into which the money is to be invested. Around 34 billion euros would have to be invested in the following multinational defense projects:

the TWISTER system, designed to improve defenses against supersonic weapons;

the development of a ""combat cloud”;

the development of strategic air transport capabilities;

the German-French development of a new air-defense system, a new generation of battle tanks and the Eurodrone;

a new artillery and munitions system in cooperation with Britain;

the development of new frigates and landing platforms in cooperation with the Netherlands;

the development of new submarine technology in cooperation with Norway.


The memo, though, calls for the vast majority of the special defense fund (around 68 billion euros) to flow into large, national defense projects:

At the top of the priority list is a successor to the ancient Tornado fighters. In his speech on Sunday, Scholz indicated that the current strategy calls for a hybrid solution, essentially taking elements of the modernized Eurofighter and from the new American super-fighter F-35 from Lockheed Martin. This project alone is estimated to cost around 15 billion euros.

Around 5 billion euros are earmarked for the new heavy transport helicopter. The Bundeswehr’s old CH-53 helicopters from the 1970s have become prohibitively expensive to maintain. A new successor model is to be purchased from the U.S. as quickly as possible. There are two different models, both of which are already available, under consideration.

Some 20 billion euros must be invested in new munitions. Because the threat level has been low for so long, the Bundeswehr hasn’t been regularly refilling its weapons depots for decades. The result is that there is a severe lack of rockets and artillery shells for tanks, ships and helicopters. If the German military is serious about fulfilling its NATO pledges by 2030, the depots must be urgently restocked.

Another expensive project is the ""Digitization of Land-Based Operations"" (D-LBO), which essentially means a revamping of all communications systems. Even today, German troops don’t communicate digitally, with the PRC117 encrypted devices a rarity in the Bundeswehr, generally only issued to special forces like the KSK. The Bundeswehr believes the digitalization of military communications will cost around 3 billion euros.

Almost 2 billion euros are to be invested in new corvette warships.
Around 600 million is to be earmarked for the modernization of Patriot air-defense systems.",00649303cd51a9d88c653be4897946850da05ba1,True,False,,,,,0,1646772202,,0,{},hzvw7zx,False,t3_t9dtk9,False,True,t1_hzulunb,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t9dtk9/what_will_germanys_armed_forces_look_like_in_2030/hzvw7zx/,1646772217,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646743402.0

First off, Ukraine is of massive economic and strategic importance. It has been called the breadbasket of the world because it has some of the best agricultural land on the planet, and almost a third of global wheat supply comes out of Ukraine. It’s strategic location on the Black Sea, and as a land buffer between NATO and Russia, makes it much more strategically valuable than Taiwan.

Secondly, Ukraine is internationally recognized as a sovereign nation, unlike Taiwan. Also, the US and UK were signatories of the Budapest Memorandum which gave assurances (but not guarantees) of Ukraine’s independence in 1994, in exchange for them surrendering the worlds third largest nuclear arsenal.

China is watching this situation closely, and if we don’t have the resolve and courage to defend Ukraine, then it seems to me that China will rightly calculate that Taiwan is free for the taking.

Furthermore, I have not been living in a world where rogue states can take territory by threatening nuclear war. I have been living in a world where such a thing has been conceivable, but it has never been tested until last week.

[],False,,TheLastVegan,,,[],,,,text,t2_a18o6o62,False,False,"Cities provide a lot of defensive cover for infantry. When Japan occupied a US city in World War II, the US army shelled and bombed US nationals to [preserve military strength due to the tactical inefficiency of firefights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaKOOqXDnqA&amp;ab_channel=ChicagoHumanitiesFestival&amp;t=34m48s). I think advertising that Ukraine is European soil whilst obscuring the fact that Ukraine is not a part of NATO gives Ukrainians a false sense of unity over the fact that they are defending European soil. Yet the decades of US military escalation in Ukraine indicate followed by a total refusal to provide direct military support indicates to me that NATO wants a sacrificial pawn to sap the RSII Coalition's military strength, in order to gain the upper hand in Iran, Syria, or the Arctic. This would also benefit China in the long-term, because every Middle Eastern country that the US topples will become economically dependent on China. What's happening to Kiev is reminiscent of what happened to Manila during World War II.

&gt;[The one big thing that the United States did to prepare its far Western territories for war (or for the possibility of war) was that it set the Philippines on the course for independence.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaKOOqXDnqA&amp;ab_channel=ChicagoHumanitiesFestival&amp;t=24m52s) 

During World War II, the US collaborated with Britain to blockade Japan's oil supplies whilst pushing the Philippines towards independence to use Filipinos as a sacrificial pawn to promote British interests. I think an interesting parallel would be to ask whether using Ukrainians as a sacrificial pawn could promote US-Saudi interests in the Middle East? This would be a repeat of what happened to Al Qaeda, with the US providing weaponry, munitions, training and military intel to start proxy wars against the RSII Coalition. After Syria repelled US interests, the US got more involved in South America, but South America has an extremely politically active populace with strong anti-imperialist sentiments (kinda like France). On the other hand, Ukraine has many yellow vest extremists and started blockading Russia years ago. War is all nonsense in the first place, and I'm baffled that combatants believe Ukraine can beat Russia. Subverting urban areas to military strongholds just leads to shelling and bombing, and it's stupid to believe that NATO will get directly involved with troops on the ground because Saudi Arabia, the United States, and China all benefit from a US proxy war between Russia and Ukraine! Crimea seceded from Ukraine in response to the military escalation against Russia, and it should be obvious that so long as Syria and Iran remain at peace, then Ukraine can never win a war against Russia. We are only repeating The Battle of Manila and giving Ukrainian combatants a false sense of hope in the same way that America guided Al Qaeda and the Philippines.

Yet I think it's entirely possible that the US will focus on the Arctic rather than Syria and Iran, because Russia and the US both have stakes in Arctic oil, so my personal hypothesis is that if Ukrainians prolong the war with Russia then the US can begin extracting oil from the Arctic.

The benefit of Ukraine being part of Europe is that Ukrainians are less likely to surrender to Russia. The benefit of Ukraine not being part of NATO is that NATO has no obligations to defend Ukraine. Joe Biden intentionally redacting Ukraine's affiliations with NATO gives Ukrainian combatants a false sense of unity with NATO and the belief that they are defending European soil, even though NATO just wants a sacrificial pawn.

The article mentions this briefly:

&gt; The other way to avoid such an insurgency is for someone—either the Ukrainians themselves, or an international coalition—to force the Russians out of Ukraine. At the moment, this seems unlikely, although the combination of robust economic sanctions and stiff resistance is making an ongoing occupation very costly.

However, this may be making light of the real economic situation here. I can't think of a situation where a country as economically weak as Russia could maintain such a massive military expense. Unless the Russians can find a way to extract resources from Ukraine fast enough to self-fund  the occupation, I simply don't see where they will get the means to pay for it.

In addition to this, Russia itself is going to soon feel the bite of having the economic rug pulled out from under them. If they were always a desperately poor nation, then the hardship of economic sanctions would be more bearable. But that's not what the Russian people are facing right now. So while Russia is engaged in a costly war, they also need to engage in a costly structural reform of their own economy.  All while the people are wondering why any of this is worth it.

Perhaps this invasion goes on for a while longer out of pure momentum. But I don't see this turning into an Afghanistan-(USSR/USA), a Vietnam-USA, an Iraq-USA, etc.  Perhaps it could evolve into some sort of situation more similar to suppression of a minority ethnic group (Iraq/Turkey-Kurds, China-Tibetans/Uyghur, Myanmar-Rohingya etc). But I see too much funding and territorial integrity for that to happen to the Ukrainians.

[],False,,Casual_Wizard,,,[],,,,text,t2_ioxv7,False,False,"Some big ticket items to consider in the next ten years (non-comprehensive list): 

**Army / Heer**

* The IFV Marder needs replacing. Germany currently operates 390 of them, and while they have been upgraded, they are almost obsolete. Industry has pitched the Puma, but the idea has also been floated to obtain Rheinmetall's Lynx instead. Cost: low two digit billions, including training, maintenance parts etc. 
* Germany drastically shrank its main battle tank force after the end of the cold war (over 2,000 in 1990, 350 today), considering big tank battles in Europe a thing of the past. Seeing what prompted the recent surge in spending, it is realistic that Germany would aim to reverse this, both by investing in the future MGCS project with France and obtaining more state-of-the-art Leopard 2 tanks in the meantime. So several billion Euros for modern Leopard 2 variants with APS as well as training for the necessary tank crews  would be a reasonable expectation. 
* With the mothballing of the Gepard, the German army lost the ability to properly conduct air defence for its armoured formations. Thoughts for a replacement have been on the table for a while, e.g. using a Boxer with a Skyranger turret and stinger missiles. Purchase of such a SHORAD system would be a reasonable expectation. Germany has also already ordered Boxers with airburst grenade launchers to defend against small drones at ultra-short ranges, so the Bundeswehr clearly considers something like that or a more advanced anti-drone vehicle a necessity for the future.
* Germany wanted to replace its service rifle, the G36, but legal proceedings have stalled that effort. The planned replacement was the Haenel MK 556. This, or its competitor - the HK 433 - may be procured, unless the US NGSW programme really speeds up and makes Germany consider a 6.8mm system. 
* The Eurocopter Tiger is a big problem, its reliability is abysmal. Germany may join a recent programme of France and Spain to upgrade the Tiger and try to salvage it, but there is a chance the Bundeswehr abandons the system entirely and buys a replacement, like the Apache. 
* Germany also urgently needs a new heavy transport helicopter, possibly the CH-53K King Stallion. That is one of the most important recent items. 

**Air Force / Luftwaffe**

* Eurofighter Typhoon needs upgrades to its radar (new AESA) and electronic warfare systems to remain relevant. If FCAS doesn't fall through, Typhoon upgrades will also be used to test systems that will be used in FCAS components like the Next Generation Fighter. 
* FCAS has hit another roadblock a few days ago, we'll see how it goes. If Dassault and Airbus can resolve their issues and Germany stays committed, then this new combat cloud as well as the Next Generation Fighter, remote carrier drones etc. will be big items on the spending list. However, France currently doesn't trust the Germans to stick with the programme, partly because ... 
* The Tornado needs replacing, especially in the nuclear carrier role. The previous administration said they would buy Super Hornets and Growlers for this role, Typhoon having the problem that certifying it for US nukes might take way too long. However, Chancellor Scholz recently mentioned the F-35 as an option for this role. This has France antsy about FCAS. If the FCAS programme fails, F-35 may be procured in roles beyond the relatively small fleet of nuclear carrier aircraft. 
* Air defence has been a big sticking point for years now (yes, that's part of the Air Force in Germany). Germany has been talking about buying the new MEADS air defence system for years, but requirements changed, then a planned order was not submitted after all ... It's a mess. It might still happen, or Germany might continue to upgrade Patriot. 
* The European TWISTER missile defence programme is quite recent, but Germany is a participant, so that'll play a role. 
* Armed Eurodrones are basically a given, now that the government has voted to certify lethal armaments on UAVs. 

**Navy / Bundesmarine**

* The new U-212 CD submarines are already on order, but Germany may well choose to procure more, provided they can train more crews. Current U-212 A submarines will likely receive upgrades down the line as well. 
* The new F-126 frigates are a big priority, since as opposed to the currently new F-125 class, they are designed for symmetrical conflicts, not primarily for anti-piracy work. With the boost in spending, more F-126 might be a possibility. The F-125 might get upgraded weaponry - currently, it does not even have a VLS. F-124 just got upgraded, but since it's the primary air defence warship, more upgrades before 2030 are likely. 
* A bigger support fleet and additional amphibious capabilities, possibly once again in cooperation with the Netherlands, are a likely priority. All in all, though, I would guess that the navy will get less priority than air force and army because Germany does not have overseas territories to protect and little reason to conduct blue water operations.",9703e7a30fc860ac5d1aaef2e307b77c14ded7f9,True,False,,,,,0,1646756860,,0,{},hzuqoy0,False,t3_t9dtk9,False,True,t3_t9dtk9,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t9dtk9/what_will_germanys_armed_forces_look_like_in_2030/hzuqoy0/,1646756878,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646728060.0

Essentially, then, I think Germany is likely to revert back to much of it's early-cold-war role - armoured infantry, tanks, ground forces. Probably alongside Poland, their goal would likely be to rapidly respond to an attack on Poland or the Baltics.

The biggest change we're likely to see is that Germany is likely to hit a point where they could pretty much single-handedly hold Russia off in Poland/Estonia/Latvia/Lithuania (particularly alongside the forces of those countries - the others are small but determined, and Poland's military isn't to be sniffed at) - which is very significant in the fact it likely frees up the other European NATO allies to operate elsewhere or counter-attack via Hungary/Romania or Norway/Sweden/Finland

Russia's most likely tactic in an attack on NATO would be the ""fait accompli"" approach of taking the Baltics very quickly and then dig in, threaten nukes, and hope NATO decide it's not worth the risk and come to a ceasefire arrangement.

Eg Russia and the US each have around 6000 warheads, but only about 1500 are deployed on each ""side"". Some will be in the process of being decommissioned, others are undergoing maintenance, and more are being held in strategic reserve (in case tensions ramp up etc)

But that still begs the question of ""Why 1500, not 500?"" - in part that's because if you've fired your nukes, you presumably believe you're under nuclear attack yourself. Which means you want absolute certainty that your response is going to be effective.

If you have 500 nukes, that may be on 60 missiles of 8 warheads each. If a handful fail, and a handful are shot down, that's suddenly down to about 400... that's still a lot, but is it going to GUARANTEE you destroy your enemy?

More importantly, does the *enemy* believe you have sufficient nukes to do so? Because nukes aren't about killing people, they're about deterrent. A quote from Charles de Gaulle (or at least, attributed to him) says it better than I ever could:

&gt;  I truly believe that one does not light-heartedly attack people who are able to kill 80 million Russians

At the end of the day, nobody (hopefully) wants to actually use their nuclear weapons. Nobody wants to kill 100 million people, nobody wins when that happens... they just want to make sure their opponent knows that they COULD do so, if attacked themselves.

Personally, I think Germany might take a less conventional approach to the increased spending. In classic German fashion, I'm expecting a revolution in how an increase in military spending can be used to upskill the wider continent.

Germany is more committed to the success of the EU than any other single member, so I'd expect them to find some inventive ways to make that 100 billion extra Euros benefit the wider Union. Some examples might be:

* Money directed towards 'native' European arms industries to reduce reliance on external providers
* Spending on infrastructure/logistics to help get material to hypothetical fronts. This includes traditional airlift (something Europe is lacking) but also dual-use infrastructure; trains or highways to get troops from Western/Central to Eastern Europe fast
* Upskilling and equipment upgrades for those European countries on the frontlines of hypothetical conflicts that don't have the same economic power as Germany. Funding for this comes out of Foreign Aid/investment in the context of countries like the US, but Germany seeing defence of Europe as the same as domestic defence, might use a portion of this money for the same purpose.

I think the above alongside a general upgrade to equipment and increase of combat airframes (manned and unmanned) would the best cost-effective way for Germany to spend its money.",0b09a97d7ed1023dcb1e3222ad7590ae2879e9df,True,False,,,,,0,1646754682,,0,{},hzul3it,False,t3_t9dtk9,False,True,t3_t9dtk9,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t9dtk9/what_will_germanys_armed_forces_look_like_in_2030/hzul3it/,1646754699,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646725882.0

[],False,,TWPYeaYouKnowMe,,,[],,,,text,t2_j7dw0kl0,False,False,"Ukraine has been sending people into combat for the last 8 years. They have plenty of experienced cadre. Part of the reason the Ukrainian military and irregular forces have done so well is because so many of the young people were already conscripted, sent to fight near Donbas, and been discharged. There were people training those people so there are experienced trainers already experienced in training

Contrast that with Russia. They've been sending their elite forces to Syria, but that's a small number, especially in the last five years or so. We don't have good information about which Russian forces have been fighting in Donbas, but it is probably again concentrated in elite units. So the regular Russian army, the rank and file, is poorly trained and isn't experienced in training since Russian conscripts get little training

Russia could pull people from the reserves, including soldiers who did time in an elite unit then got out. There is plenty of former airborne soldiers in Russian cities. We know this because every August 2 they get drunk and beat people up in the middle of the day. But the regular forces just don't have the training infrastructure that is needed to whip the conscripts into shape

Ukraine has trainers and a motivated pool of candidates who want to learn. Russia I suspect will have increasing trouble fielding decent rank and file. Even if they can find good trainers, the students won't be receptive

Look at the American military near the end of the Vietnam War. The Green Berets, SEALs, CIA ninjas, etc were at their finest, maybe ever. They had groups of jungle assassins doing amazing things. But it didn't make up for the fact that the average American infantryman was a conscript who didn't want to be there and didn't see the war as either just or winnable

[],False,,DecentlySizedPotato,,,[],,,,text,t2_5f0gxk9t,False,False,"&gt; Destroying a few S-300 and S-400s around Belarus will do approximately nothing to stop NATO planes being shot down. 

How does destroying Russian SAMs that would shoot down NATO aircraft not prevent them from being shot down? Again, anti-ballistic radars are generally purpose built, and an S-400 would at best catch an ICBM flying over itself, by which time the ABM radars would have picked it up. Destroying the air defence systems alone does not degrade Russia's ability to respond to a nuclear strike at all. The early warning radars close to the border could be left alone, both so Russia can see what NATO is doing and that they're enforcing the NFZ, and so that they won't think a nuclear strike is coming.

As for your last point, a nuclear decapitating strike with Tomahawks makes no sense and has no chance of succeeding. First, there's quite a distance from Belarus to Moscow, over half an hour of flight, you can't really disguise a cruise missile attack on Moscow's ABM facilities as a SEAD attack. And of course, Russia has a strong nuclear force and is able to respond to any attack even after being hit itself. There is absolutely no reason for Russia to just decide to carry out a preemptive nuclear strike because the US launched some Tomahawks. And like I said earlier, no one wants a nuclear war, so it stands to reason that people won't be eager to launch strategic nuclear weapons unless absolutely necessary.

&gt;Do you not think it's at least partially insane to send missiles that are known to be capable of carrying a nuclear payload into Russian territory to destroy the Russian military and expect that there will be no nuclear reprisal for what could very well be a nuclear decapitation strike?

So, nope, don't think it's insane. Also I think you're under the impression that I am in favour of a NFZ over Ukraine, I am not. All I'm saying is that establishing it won't mean Earth would instantly explode like some think.

[],False,,nuclearselly,,,[],,,,text,t2_v479g,False,False,"&gt;Personally I don't buy into the ""Omg nuclear armageddon"" talk. **russia is not suicidal.**

If Russia is being invaded (or feels an invasion is imminent) then it's suicidal for them to not at least use tactical nuclear weapons against invading forces if they can't beat them back via conventional means.

The problem from that point onwards is the risk of an escalation spiral. No one would introduce nuclear weapons at a strategic level from the get-go, it will be an escalation as leaders become more desperate. The scenario is the case you've described would be as follows:

1. NATO being the conventionally superior force, push Russia back to its border. Russia is fearful of the force on its border and doesn't have the equipment to push it back conventionally.
2. Tactical nuclear weapons are used - justified by Russia as defending their country from invasion. This immediately upsets the conventional balance and gives Russia a chance to regain ground with conventional forces.
3. NATO is then under pressure to respond and is itself fearful of the superior conventional forces heading towards them (and reeling from possibly tens of thousands of troops being killed).
4. NATO similarly releases tactical nuclear weapons against the Soviets.

All bets are off from that point, but you could have 100,000s servicemen (and undoubtedly civilians) dead from nuclear weapons on the European continent. Perhaps cooler heads will prevail at this point, or fear of continued escalation leads to more targets across Russia and NATO being hit.

I think people in the post-Cold War era still think of nuclear weapons purely in terms of these huge lumbering multi-megaton strategic weapons that are only useful for MAD purposes, but the US, UK, France, Russia all have contingencies where they would use weapons outside of a nuclear attack on themselves. They've all got access to tactical (or variable yield) warheads, and have delivery methods that would not instantly trigger a massive retaliation (IE - ICBM missile farms are not the only way to deliver a nuke).

This is why it's so important to stop nuclear powers from engaging in open conflict with each other - especially when the borders of one or more of the countries is involved. If one feels they are at threat of invasion by a force they can't repel, they will be under pressure to use everything they have to guarantee their continued independence.",8bc971ddbe11bba084b7a351f4e55f8addd8fc1d,True,False,,,,,0,1646729985,,0,{},hztffwg,False,t3_t8ybue,False,True,t1_hzsffgl,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t8ybue/nofly_zone_in_ukraine_war_with_russia_by_another/hztffwg/,1646729997,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646701185.0

Something between that and planes, which it's starting to look unlikely will be supplied (in time). For example, any longer-range AA systems, artillery, drones, etc.

It seems like the biggest challenges faced by Ukrainian military are:
* cruise missiles degrading C&amp;C and airfields in Western Ukraine
* matching response to ranged artillery with own artillery
* Russia's air superiority which limits armored counteroffensives

In terms of AA is there anything between MANPADS and patriots? Aster or any medium range systems out there? Is it too late/not enough value add as damage done by cruise missiles is already done/Russian air is not super effective?

I understood the reason for not providing patriots was the 6-month training period, worry about falling into Russian hands (and cost?) maybe with hindsight how the invasian has gone, had Ukraine had patriots and a 3-month crash course in training it could have limited cruise missile impact and C&amp;C/air infrastructure and we'd see Ukraine even taking a slight edge at this stage. Of course that's hindsight with poor Russian performance in other areas.

There are a lot more than ""a few"". There's no limited SEAD that doesn't result in significant losses for NATO aircraft. They either succeed in SEAD or they don't. We're talking about dozens of battalions and more than a hundred individual units that would need to be destroyed in detail to avoid any NATO aircraft being shot down.

&gt;S-400 can't detect ICBMs that aren't targeted at its region.

They can detect Tomahawks, which are nuclear missiles of a particularly dangerous variety because of their low warning time. Destroying S-400s further degrades an already short warning period for a short range decapitation strike. If the US wanted to complete a nuclear decapitation strike, it would most likely do so with nuclear Tomahawks, and then follow up with a counterforce ICBM strike after the Russian C&amp;C infrastructure was degraded, and reserve bombers and subs for second strike capability against China and remaining Russian nuclear forces. If Russia sees it's earliest warning system for a short-range decapitation strike being degraded it's not going to just accept that. It's part of their nuclear defence, it's also part of their conventional defence against NATO planes.

There is generally a very clear line between material support and direct intervention. The former is firmly within the realm of proxy warring, the latter is an escalation from it. Such an escalation occurring on and perhaps across the Russian border, as it would likely have to in order to be effective, would be very easy to perceive as a direct assault on Russia, and thus a situation that calls for escalation.

I don't think so, but again I don't have an idea of how many they had on hand at the start of the war. They definitely used them during the attempted blitzkrieg, and my sense is that, as with most of its cutting edge tech, Russia doesn't have as much of it as it wants outsiders to think. That seems to be a theme throughout - a little bit of cutting edge stuff with a ton of old, badly maintained things in reserve all showing up on counts as the same broad category of equipment/armament. 

It seems much more likely to me that if any were saved they were saved for a few specific intended uses in *this* war and that Russia had fewer PGMs than people guessed rather than having significantly more. Before this war I thought the Russian army had largely reformed and modernized as compared to where it was during Chechnya, but it really looks like that process was only carried through halfway at best and some of the old stereotypes are proving true to a level I didn't expect.

As far as pilots having a say - I think that's an example of outdated impressions. There isn't that much of a class aspect to it, and they'll fly the mission assigned just like in any semidisciplined army. Russia's also not been shy about using its elites - the paratroopers are seen internally as its 'crack' troops and were deployed early on in the blitzkrieg to almost uniformly disastrous results. 

I think the safest thing here is to not speculate not having the info on it.

MAD was essentially cooked up in US think tanks and may or may not have been policy in most western nations nuclear posture. Deterrence theory makes too many assumptions and it requires both parties to be on the same page. The first problem with this is that those think tanks were not located Russia and unfortunately the Russians did not get the message regarding deterrence. Here is a ""well articulated"" quote from an American cold war field commander regarding the Soviet war plans and their views on the use of tactical i.e. battlefield Nukes. 

""This kind of evidence, of course, does not confirm the widely held view in Western circles that the Warsaw Pact and its Soviet leadership understood or adhered to Western “deterrence theory” as constructed for the use of nuclear weapons. On the contrary, it shows how wildly misplaced such assumptions about Soviet thinking on nuclear weapons really was. This is not to argue that Soviet leaders took a reckless view of their use. On the contrary, abundant evidence exists showing how awed they were by nuclear weapons. But they had to decide what they would do with such weapons if war actually broke out. And this Czech war plan shows that they decided to use them like big artillery, to support and speed up a traditional ground invasion of NATO territory.

I disagree that it’s likely to kill us all in the medium term. We just have to give Putin a way out besides outright capitulation; a peace deal that he can sell to his supporters as a partial victory (This shouldn’t be hard for him, as he is selling war as a peacekeeping mission). Maybe we agree that Ukraine will never join NATO, or maybe let him keep Crimea. He is already failing miserably at his strategic objectives, and I believe he would take a generous peace deal rather than double down and start a nuclear war, which would likely lead to his own destruction.

Moreover, instituting a no-fly zone is not just about saving Ukrainian lives. I don’t want to live in a world where people like Putin can simply take over countries, on a whim, simply by threatening nuclear war.

You say that after just acknowledging the first several steps up the ladder are all rational.

You are also not accounting for the risk of miscalculation or error. A western jet firing on a SAM battery that's locked on thinks the battery is in Ukraine, but is actually just across the border. Congrats, you just struck targets in Russia. Or a missile sent to take out a radar array used by a SAM battery ends up slamming into an early warning radar instead by accident, just as Russian cruise missiles have accidentally hit tower blocks or container shits when on the way to other targets.

Third, it's not the generals making the decisions here. A civilian leadership that bows to the public's desire for a NFT, followed by a bombing campaign against Russian ground forces in Ukraine when the NFT fails to halt the Russian advance, might not balk at further escalatory steps.

To clarify, I'm not saying this is the most probable future, that one step up the ladder will always result in another.

1. Nato airbases along the entire border are immediately hit by a significant number of the remaining russian missile forces including ballistics, cruise and hypersonic missile strikes. NATO defenses would not be able to intercept all of them and many airbases would be damaged temporarily. US would probably respond in kind with massive cruise missile strikes at russian airbases with similar results
2. Nato would then have to initially launch long range strikes from much further away air bases relying heavily on the significant US air tanker fleet. This would drop their sortie rates and degrade NATO air power performance relative to what it could be.
3. The US / French and maybe UK carrier battle groups would attempt to fill in some of the gap from the destroyed airfields but they would be attacked by russian missile forces as well. If a carrier battle group were badly hit then the gloves come off and NATO would likely be fully commited to at least conventional war vs russia
4. Eventually once enough nearby airfields are repaired NATO airpower effectiveness will increase and russian capabilities will start to suffer more.
5. In the long run I have no doubt that NATO has the ability to trash the russian airforce as a fighting force and significantly degrade their missile forces but NATO would still have significant aircraft losses.
6. Russia would probably go to a total war footing domestically
7. Even worse we have to deal with the possibility that China would begin to supply the russians with weapons and aircraft much in the same way we supply ukraine. This would be a smart move for them.

NATO shooting down Russian aircraft or engaging ground targets within Ukraine - fine, that's why they would be there.

Russia shooting at NATO jets with SAM sites - to be expected.

NATO engaging Russian SAM sites within Russia - perhaps, but is escalatory and it may not be necessary. NATO could just as easily deploy low observable aircraft like F-22s and F-35s with heavy EW support to mitigate the effectiveness of SAMs outside of Ukrainian territory.

Russia striking airbases in Poland/elsewhere - also definitely escalatory and Russian might not have the capacity to do it with any effect. They've yet to defeat the Ukrainian air force and air defence system and their capacity to launch strikes that far is limited.

West striking elsewhere in Russia - this would just be stupid, and there's no reason to do it. It would serve no tactical purpose, and NATO generals are usually not idiots. Even as a reaction to a strike on a NATO base, it's not compulsory to engage in tit for tat strikes just because the other side did it first. There's absolutely no chance they would strike at strategic assets as it would again be needlessly escalatory.

 I’ve been trying to find data on this, looking at historical trends, but sources are limited for someone who doesn’t know Ukrainian or Russian. I did find some information from [GlobalSecurity.org](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/ukraine/personnel.htm) (their staff looks excellent, are they considered very legit or not so much?)

&gt;From 2014 through 2018, the Armed Forces of Ukraine lost more than 33,000 people to desertion. As of early 2019, about 9,300 troops had deserted from the Ukrainian army. This is more than 4.5 percent of the total number of servicemen approved by the Verkhovna Rada in 2015. According to the first Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Ivan Rusnak, who voiced these data, such a number of deserters leads to a serious understaffing of the military units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AF). Under current law, deserters formally continued to be on the military unit's list for as long as they are wanted. So, during this time, financial and financial support is allocated to them, and their position cannot be taken by another person.

&gt;By 2018 Ukraine faced an ongoing flight from the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces - 11 thousand people broke the contract for the first half of 2018 and another 18 thousand were ready to do this before the end of the year. ""For the Ukrainian army, if we consider that its real composition is less than 200 thousand people, every seventh quit or quit this year,” Yuri Butusov, editor-in-chief of the website “Censor.net”, said on August 5 on Ukrainian television. “Moreover, the most experienced and motivated servicemen will quit.”

&gt;In 2014 the army suffered heavy desertion and nearly 30 percent of the servicemen called up in the first wave of mobilization (March 17) abandoned their positions, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said.

I suppose Zelenskyy preventing young men from leaving the country will clamp down on desertion, but I feel that would-be deserters will just become POWs.

What a no-fly zone in Ukraine would mean for the U.S., NATO

 There have been growing calls in recent days for the United States and NATO to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Ukrainian President Zelensky reiterated the plea on Monday, but what is a no-fly zone and how would it work? For that we turn to two former U.S. ambassadors to NATO. Retired Army Lt. General Doug Lute and Kurt Volker join Judy Woodruff to discuss.

Nope. Risk averse isn't the right term. 

The cost benefit analysis of a no fly zone does not pan out in NATO's (or the human race as a wholes) interest. 

Establishing a no fly zone means choosing to climb the escalation ladder. The only credible response Russia has to that escalation at this point is Nuclear war or capitulation, because it is clear that Russian forces cannot stop NATO conventionally. 

It is not a given that Vladimir Putin would choose the logical option (capitulation) at this point, mainly because it would likely result in the end of his regime and death. 

As such it follows that the most likely response to a no fly zone would be a first strike. Because it is initiated by NATO action the order is likely to be followed by Russian high command. 

So it follows that a no fly zone is a bad idea because there is a direct line of decisions between that and global thermonuclear war.

Really wish he would've expanded more on this besides ""A lot of people don't know what they're talking about and I do.""

You can't be an expert on everything and this is his weakest case, imo. It takes a lot of time, energy, and practice to conduct complex air ops. And that has to be done prior to wartime. Russia conducts large force exercises with air forces present, sure, but they're not nearly as complex as NATO/Allied/even Chinese air exercises. Russian air force participation in these large exercises are usually pretty sterile engagements against passive targets. To think they can just turn this ability on in wartime is wishful thinking. Their air forces may conduct more intense training at home, but that will be with their own squadron; meaning no dissimilar air combat training or combined arms with ground forces/JTAC equivalents.

Russia may have crack squadrons (like the Su-34 unit we've seen employed in the last few days), but they clearly haven't been successful. Ukraine's air and air defense forces are a generation behind Russia's yet are surviving and continuing to bring down advanced aircraft 10+ days into the war. That does not speak to an air force that trains against complex air defenses.

He mentioned they've employed ARMs. An ARM, while technically can be just point and shoot, is not the magic air defense killer that many people and DCS players think it is. A variety of factors improve or degrade probability of kill and if Russian pilots are just slinging them at any emitting radar (which I assume since they don't have dedicated SEAD units) and the radar operators are competent (which we can assume since they've survived for 10+ and continue to shoot down aircraft), their probability of kill is very low.

Sure, I can't say ""100% Russia can't conduct a complex air campaign"", but I will say it is likely most of their forces don't have the capability. Their top of the line regiments who went to Syria and regularly participate in large force exercises like Zapad? Maybe. Their other air regiments who rarely train with other units?

I'm not advocating for getting rid of democracy, I love the representative republic I live in, but in the scheme of things, on a world power scale, the fact that public opinion can so easily change the actions of the leaders is actually a weakness. 

all it really takes is a committed media campaign to change what the people think. the war between Spain and the US being a perfect example of this.

what I'm pointing out is that Putin cannot depend on the EU, NATO, or the US to continue to sit on their hands if he goes for a siege type invasion. If the media runs video of starving people who look just like them, dress just like them, have homes and lives just like them, day after day, the public opinion will swing to getting involved no matter the cost.

Historically what generally happens with attrition warfare is that the front lines look stable for a long while and then one day something crumbles and there is suddenly a major shift. At the moment I do not know enough about Russian and Ukrainian logistics, reserves, potential reinforcements, and willpower to be able to judge which side will crack first. If I had to guess, I would say that the Ukrainians will crack first. However incompetent the Russian military might be, still Russia as a country has no shortage of trucks, fuel, ammunition, spare weapons, and so on - to get them to the front is just a matter of effective organization, and I would imagine that the Russians are probably getting better at that as the war goes on and the various Russian military leaders gain actual experience at doing things besides looking good in meetings and stealing the Russian taxpayers' money.

That said, even if the Ukrainians crack first, that will just mean that the stalled Russian advance will resume - it will not mean that Russia has won the war. The Russians would then be faced with the task of maneuvering further into Ukraine towards the new Ukrainian lines, with trying to take heavily guarded cities, and so on.

[],False,,ProfessorDowellsHead,,,[],,,,text,t2_hxfc4,False,True,"Russian army is &gt;1 million, 190,000 is just what was deployed for the invasion, which is why the idea is/was if Russia *really* wants to lean it can do it at even 1:4 casualty ratios. The other two thoughts most had were that Russia would immediately have total air superiority and, in the background, the idea that the Ukrainian army was as badly trained and prepared is at had been in 2014 right after the revolution.

As to the numbers difference - I think a lot of people didn't really consider Russia's logistic capability (or lack thereof). It had done well in very limited engagements against largely irregular forces and that gave the impression the army was that competent throughout, which has been proven false.

The lack of air superiority is probably the oddest thing because Russia has many more aircraft. For a few days that was because it was trying to blitzkrieg through and minimize civilian casualties (which stopped on day 4). It looks like it's a combination of Russia having bad intel and hitting the wrong targets when trying to eliminate Ukraine's airforce on the ground. It's possible that the airforce has similar morale, training, and logistics problems as the rest of the army but there's no evidence of that as far as I'm aware. Quite a bit of it has stayed out of the fight, and that may be because of the third factor...

Western weapons. The Ukrainian army was much better trained and, due to the ongoing conflict in DPR and LNR that Russia has kept going, battle tested than previously but still lacked the equipment to deal with the most modern of Russian tech widely. In the month leading up to the war, and particularly in the week that it was delayed through Biden calling out Putler's plans publicly (and China not wanting its Olympics spoiled further), the west flooded Ukraine with the anti-tank weapons, MANPADS, etc that have been used to such good effect against Russian vehicles, planes, and helicopters. Those weapons have been a huge force multiplier and may have contributed to some of Russia's reluctance to fully deploy its air forces.

A final thing that's hard to quantify is morale and expected reaction. No one could have predicted the extent of the west's unprecedented sanctions. Few if anyone would have predicted how directly arms are continuing to be supplied. Without either of these, the war would be much more a matter of when Ukraine gets stomped, not if (it's still far from a sure thing that it isn't, and that's with shocking Russian incompetence and morale issues and pretty much everything breaking Ukraine's way in a way it hasn't broken for a country in immediate memory). If people felt that Russia is just stomping us, there wouldn't have been the resistance mobilized which is demoralizing Russian troops and screwing with supply lines. So I think part of the prediction was a sort of circular 'the war is clearly unwinnable for Ukraine, and people won't fight an unwinnable war, and without popular support a war against a numerically and technologically superior opponent is unwinnable.'",78d20ebdf36a1a258b71f7f78750ec3829b7949e,True,False,,,,,0,1646699712,,0,{},hzryf8d,False,t3_t8o76e,False,True,t1_hzrw00t,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t8o76e/ukraine_megathread_march_7/hzryf8d/,1646699726,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646670912.0

- Daylight bombing that mostly just blows up houses, IE what the USAAF often achieved: possibly a war crime, depends on proportionality.
- Night bombing that is allegedly trying to hit industrial targets but falls all over the city, IE what the RAF started off with: war crime.

-Ukraine materiel losses lower than Russia in absolute terms but not as a percentage of the entire supply.
