""Nations that engage in war are rightfully criticised and punished by the global community."" 

Nobody was punished for Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, or any other hot war or proxy war for that matter. 

And we've been competing over economics and science forever. Where the hell did you think the nukes came from in the first place? 

Humans don't really innovate in the sense of that word. We create better ways to kill ourselves. We create better bombs, bullets, knives, and armor. When the top soil is eroded from bad farming practices we synthesize fertilizers and pesticides that poison us because we never listen to the natives when they told us to rotate crop fields. 

Science will only take one so far, as a nation needs ethics for it to help humanity. As a computer scientist I can tell you standards from Lockheed Martin that date back decades are still used in the field to this day. You wanna guess what that system was used create?

Or what about operation paperclip? I mean Nazis are bad, but it's OK when they make you rockets, right?

I love the scientific method, but we create to destroy, control, and subvert other nations.

In the end i don't know much about the conflict between them so i can't say anything all i can say is I'm not huge fans of either of these countries.

But China ? I fucking hate China. I'm Turkish we have Turkic ancestry and these Chinese mother fuckers are killing my Uyghur brothers. I hate it. We've been enemies with them ever since we, the Turks, used to live in Central Asia and to this day i consider ourselves to be still enemies. There is only a single event in which i support China. The Western nations used to do a lot of colonization (something they still do to this day.) That's how they got so powerful in the first place just used every other part of this world for their own benefit, never giving a fuck about the people living in these parts of the world. Now China is trying to do the same thing colonizing and all that and the Western nations are against it. Why ? You did the exact same thing before and it is something you still do ? Why isn't other nations allowed to do what you have done previously ? i hate China but in this single situation I will support them.

I don't think NATO is a threat to world peace. The big nations inside of NATO like USA are a threat to world peace. Smaller nations inside of NATO are there only for protection and i don't blame them for that. However i do blame ALL of NATO for backstabbing us time and time again. It's not NATO that's the problem. It's the big nations inside of NATO and the fact that NATO and just the Western World in general always alienates us. Because we are Turkish ? Because of our history with the Ottoman Empire ? Because Turkey is a majority Islam nation ? Because we own İstanbul the West's really precious city ? Because we are in the Middle East/Asia ? There is a lot of reasons and i don't care at this point. If NATO wants to keep alienating us then so be it.

667.0,[],False,,JoshPigeonfeather,,,[],,,,text,t2_8j85prr0,False,False,"In the movie ""Dr. Strangelove"" based on Peter George's novel ""Red Alert""   
(1958). A United States Air Force Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper has   
gone mad and commands a group of nuclear bomb carrying bombers to attack  
 targets in the Soviet Union in the hope that all US nuclear forces will  
 launch an all out attack in order to avert being wiped out by the   
inevitable retaliatory strike his attack will elicit. He tells his   
underlings ""Yes gentlemen, they are on their way in and no one can bring  
 them back. For the sake of our country and our way of life, I suggest   
you get the rest of SAC in after them, otherwise we will be totally   
destroyed by red retaliation. My boys will give you the best kind of   
start, fourteen hundred megatons worth, and you sure as hell won't stop   
them now. So let's get going.There's no other choice. God willing, we   
will prevail in peace and freedom from fear and in true health through   
the purity and essence of our natural fluids. God bless you all.  
""The referenced to ""natural fluids"" is the general's paranoid belief   
that fluoride in municipal water supplies is a Soviet plot to pollute   
the ""precious bodily fluids"" of Americans. What follows is mostly scenes  
 inside a command center with top US military and government figures   
along with the president of the US. The other scenes are mostly onboard   
the one US bomber that has survived Soviet and US attempts to shoot all   
bombers in their group down so they don' set off WW III. The plot ends   
badly with the one surviving bomber bombing the Soviet's""Doomsday   
Machine"", which is meant to set off some kind of nuclear scenario which   
will end all life on earth so that if the Soviet Union is bombed into   
nonexistence, at least they'll take the rest of the world with them.  
The conversation in the war room is turned to options for surviving   
the nuclear war by wheelchair-bound, presidential scientific advisor, a   
former German Nazi Dr. Strangelove. The Doctor suggests that a small of   
elites (including of course his self and all present in the war room)   
could survive the radiation fallout in shelter built into a salt mine.   
He goes on to insist this redoubt be populated with a1 0:1   
female-to-male ratio for a breeding program to repopulate the Earth once  
 the radiation has subsided, with the females being ""of exceptional   
sexual nature.""  
Are there parallels between this plot and the current kerfuffle   
coming out of Russia today. Is Putin General Ripper? Is Putin's military  
 venture to retake a reluctant (to say the least) Ukraine back into   
Putin's proposed reconstituted Soviet Union meant to elicit direct   
combat between Russian and NATO forces,eventually leading to nuclear war  
 between the two nuclear superpowers?  
Putin is cited by several well established journalists to be   
collecting a harem of women who he has impregnated and set up living in   
exceptionally desirable locations with a lavish trust fund to guarantee   
their survival (and probably to keep their mouth shut).  
Putin has had constructed a massive palace on the Black Sea coast.   
One source states that ""Putin’s Palace has 16-storey underground   
bunker"". Add to this the fact that many of the the Oligarchs supporting   
the Putin regime have taken residence on massive cities on cruise ship   
hulls which could take refuge in harbors with less radiation exposure.   
\*1  
""Putin has moved his family to secret Siberian nuclear bunker, expert  
 claims"" is title of a story in the March 1, 2022 UK Mirror news site.   
\*2  
Is Putin trying to set off WW III, where he and his Oligarchs (maybe)  
 might luxuriate in a 16 story underground bunker stocked with women of   
exceptional sexual nature, with only the job of keeping them perpetually  
 impregnated to occupy their time?  
After all, Chernobyl didn't go so badly did it? There's hunting for   
boar there now and farmers nearby are growing potatoes and probably   
engaging in the Russian sport of remaining drunk on vodka made from them  
 for as much time as possible.   
Vlad and his clan can roam the depopulated planet and live the life, with no one to tell him what to do.  
More room for Vlad and more for his clan.

The same applies to Latvia, for example.  
Poland is more interesting. It's a long history of mutual kicks. Who is stronger than that and kicked. Now Poland is Russia, then Russia is Poland.  
Now imagine an alternate world. A revolution is taking place in the United States and, as a result, Texas and Alaska are breaking off.  
Do you want to say that the United States (more precisely, what will happen after it) will not try to return them if possible?

We asked for AA systems, Americans refused. We needed them so we looked for other people that could sell it to us and share the technology so we can make our own in the future. Russia was willing to do it so we got S-400s from them. Americans got mad, kicked us out of the F-35 program, refused to give us our F-16s and still refuses to help us unless we get rid of the S-400s that we bought.

Western nations have been supporting our enemies. Ever heard of what the Greeks did in Cyprus prior to our ""invasion"" ? Ever heard of PKK ? You probably saw people supporting that group. I've seen videos of it. And guess what ? We've been fighting these guys for the last 30 years. They've been killing Turks, Kurds both civilian and military personnel. They are internationally recognized as a terrorist organization. And our allies refuse to help us, they arm our enemies instead.

I've been seeing people telling me i don't belong in NATO and now they just say ""go get em tiger"" because our drones did good work in Ukraine and we can close the straits to Russia. When the war ends the West will go back to alienating us.

Oh and those drones ? The drones that Americans didn't want us sharing with the Ukrainians ? The drones that were called ""Erdoğan's unmanned killing machines"" in Armenia ? Now they are being praised by the West. The same West that didn't want us sharing them with the Ukrainians, the same West that shoved down shit down our throats when we were helping our ally Azerbaijan in Armenia.

I'm not even gonna get into the sanctions our ""allies"" put on us. 

After all of this how can you ask me to support the West ? It is clear they do not care about countries like us. They never did. And they never will. After the war is over the West will go back to hating us, backstabbing us and calling us terrorists while supporting internationally recognized terrorist organizations. Ukraine is doing the right thing. I used to hate it when I was told that i didn't belong in NATO. But now i only regret not listening to those people.

Don’t hit me with the usual “I actually am against that and was speaking up” because yeah we know we know, how heroic you were defending those Libyan civilians, Syrian ones or Afghani. 

Moving on, Ukraine has a serious nazi problem. And it’s not Ukraines problem, it’s the entire worlds problem. Attacks in the USA and Europe have been linked to terrorists who have had trained in the Azov battalion before committing these acts. Wanted criminals go from European countries to Europe to continue supporting their beliefs. Nazi beliefs, if you will.

This war is way more complicated than you think it is, neither I or you are capable of making decisions about it. You may call Putin a “nazi” (ironic as hell, makes you seem dumb and uninformed) but many others, including my grandma and my family that is currently in Trieschyna, Kiev, believe that Zelensky is a corrupt clown who acts like he’s in a movie for the west, instead of either surrendering or making talks about a coalition to take down the Azov, since they’re the bad guy. But I doubt he’s foggy vision will ever allow him to do that. He was a comedian, has zero experience when it comes to politics and war and people defend him by saying that his grandpa was a jew. So fucking what lol? All the grandpas of these Azov scums were Soviets who were dying for the freedom of the Soviet Union and todays Ukraine. So what?

A Russian motor-rifle battalion has like 300 men, and from what I know, rule of thumb for Russian brigades is that they always have only one infantry regiment (generally 3, sometimes 2 battalions) . 

Of course they would have their tank battalion, 2 artillery battalions, one MLRS battalion, the engineer battalion and the anti aircraft battalion, but those are generally significantly smaller than infantry battalions (an armored battalion is closer to 100 men) . 

Averaging them at 200 men per battalion you get around 1800 men. 


That's my own maths bere, it may be wrong. I just don't know what more you could add to get 3000.

And they generally do it because he promises some kind of better life either on this earth or the next. He then tells them it’s because of these kinds of people that they are suffering and they must be eradicated. And again the peasants go along for the ride. Now the rest of the world say hey guy this is wrong don’t act like this try to be better people. But your peasant class still goes along with the despot blindly.
