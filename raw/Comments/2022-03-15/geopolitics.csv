My personal opinion, based on my own research and discussions with a close friend who is Chinese, is that the odds of China taking Taiwan by force will peak over the next 10 years and ebb away after that.

That is based on Chinese rhetoric (a truly terrible source of information) and the demographics of Taiwan. There appear to be genuine fears that Taiwan will stop identifying as Chinese if China leaves them outside of the fold for much longer. 

Further, the way that the CCP view the first island ring containment is like a gun to their heads. Very similar to the Russian concerns over NATO. 

But ultimately the reason it is so hard for me to predict that, is because I like to see the real capabilities present and I don't see China having the capability to effect an amphibious military operation to take Taiwan. Nothing short of a massive false flag operation, combined with predeployment (somehow) of the Chinese military and total area denial from both the Taiwanese Airforce and external parties would see a successful Chinese takeover by force. 

A critical aspect here would be whether China is capable to building up enough meaningful support within Taiwan in the days leading up to invasion that would support their efforts towards forceful unification. 

If China somehow magically acquired the capability (and I suppose this statement would stand if it was suddenly revealed that they were secretely building the capability this whole time), I would say within the next 1-3 years.

Way to paint a broad brush, huh? The way you describe western countries make it seem like they are some monolith, controlled by an elite circle. Well, the latter is true to an extent, but the elite in western States are not diabolical masterminds. That dissent is tolerated and often encouraged in western countries should tell you that representative/democratic systems are very complex and only rarely do you see a united resolve such that you can say ""America is evil!"" 

There is no singular ""America"", there's just a bunch of people largely insulated from geopolitical conflict with certain demographics having historically enjoyed greater privilege and, logically, are very afraid of losing that status. Some members don't think it's a big deal while others become violent and cling to delusions. It's a messy affair, but this and other issues are out in the open, debated, discussed, etc. Somehow out of this process is a government that largely satisfies the majority of its own population. Sometimes at the expense of other nations, but everyone has blood on their hands and a reasonable person would admit as much.

Contrast this with Russia and other autocratic nations that can't seem to function without strong leaders. These nations are quite literally stuck in the medieval mindset that a single person (or family or tribe or business partners, whatever) who is currently head of State *is the* State (see famous quote by Louis XIV). Such a personal association to power makes for a very unstable system over the long term with peaceful transitions unlikely. Moreover, the flaws of the autocrat greatly magnify into their rule.

I'll consider reposting this with my sources if need be. I contemplated applying sources, but ultimately decided I wanted to focus more on the discussion itelf. 

&gt;Xi Jinping and other Chinese officials love to go around various countries making promises of investment etc.

I'm not disputing that leaders lie, embelish or make false promises. Hence my brutish approach to geopolitics by giving far more priority on the actual actions taken rather than things said. 

&gt;There are many within the CCP that don't like China getting too close to Russia, especially after the invasion.

Your first source here was behind a paywall as I don't subscribe to wsj, your second didn't reinforce this point at all. The only issue it posited for the Russia/China partnership was not all their hardware is compatible. The rest of the article seemed to indicate the exact opposite of the CCP not supporting Russia after the invasion. Also, the article suggests that the partnership is a personal project and priority for Xi Jinping, hardly an indictment on how seriously the CCP views their bilateral relationship with Russia. 

I think that the harsh reality of the situation is China not only knew about Russia's plans to invade Ukraine:

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/us/politics/russia-ukraine-china.html

But also that China anticipated sanctions and continued to deepen ties with Russia:

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/26/business/china-russia-ukraine.html

Furthermore, the Chinese have been actively promoting the idea that the war, while tragic, is a valid response to western interference in Ukraine.

https://www.brookings.edu/techstream/china-and-russia-are-joining-forces-to-spread-disinformation/

&gt;Calling U.S.-China competition a ""new Cold War"" is fundamentally misleading.

I don't recall calling it that. The Cold War was categorised by the non-combative competition brought on due to the parity or near parity between the Soviet Union and the United States. The current balance of power is far more complex, volatile and prone to escalation, in my opinion. 

&gt;What is the whole point of the BRI if China has bad relations with Europe? The whole trans-Eurasian railway is effectively dead right now.

As your source states, there is no indication that it was actually profitable to begin with. I have yet to read an academic article on the actual volume of trade and the actual profitability of the European portion of the railway prior to the 2022 Ukraine crisis. 

But as for the greater point, I don't see why China is necessarily choosing between Russia and Europe. I think they see it as choosing between the United States and Russia. What makes you think Europe will attempt to meaningfully punish China over Ukraine? 

Regarding your conclusion, I'm not quite certain I know enough about Xi Jinping to agree or disagree with you, but I do think that its a little early to claim that Putin played Xi.",bb0c501e6004dfea6274eab052f1529b808ea6a5,True,False,,,,,0,1647385067,,0,{},i0ta7bs,True,t3_teijzm,False,True,t1_i0shuom,/r/geopolitics/comments/teijzm/how_overlapping_core_interests_reinforces_the/i0ta7bs/,1647385082,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647356267.0,

If you list countries that were poor in 1900 but rich in 2000, there are only three countries on that list: South Korea, Taiwan and China with the caveat that China still has massive poverty but that it's also on the verge of breaking into tier 1 status as top great power alongside the US. And all three countries are in East Asia, and all three countries used export manufacturing driven state capitalist or state capitalist lite model for growth. 

The thing is, with new technologies, chiefly automation, that export manufacturing growth model may not be possible going forward, the Chinese may have caught the last carriage on that particular train. In the future, with automation, 3D printing, robotics, AI, developing a massive industry centered on manufacturing may not be economically feasible. Otherwise, you're looking at something like India that's been trying to uplift their population with primarily service based economy with relatively little manufacturing. And that hasn't been working out for them, India is substantially poorer than China now in 2022 and India is yet to hit the insane explosive growth stage like China had 1990 to ~2015. 

Other massive structural advantage poorer countries today have is their massive and young workforce compared to ageing workforces of the rich countries. But, again, with the development of robots *if* robots keep growing that may seriously devalue human resources which would be to the benefit of already rich countries that lack workforce and to the benefit of poor countries that have too many workers. 

The main counter argument to this, btw, since I'm not guaranteeing this will happen as that is impossible, is that many of these technologies may not mature well enough or may not mature fast enough to throttle Africa's growth. People have been promising ""human like robots"" in 20 years since the 1950s and they may never come about, or they may come about in 100+ years which would be enough time for Africa to develop, accumulate wealth and use that wealth in R&amp;D of their own.",219c3757d48433a27a62b5512d717ec1c99e81a9,True,False,,,,,0,1647380988,,0,{},i0t02yj,False,t3_tel8vo,False,True,t1_i0seaey,/r/geopolitics/comments/tel8vo/analyzing_the_russiaukraine_conflict_from_an/i0t02yj/,1647381005,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647352188.0,

Here's an excerpt of a report from an inquiry by the British Parliament. 

*""32. Despite his rhetoric, the proposition that Muammar Gaddafi would have ordered the massacre of civilians in Benghazi was not supported by the available evidence. The Gaddafi regime had retaken towns from the rebels without attacking civilians in early February 2011. During fighting in Misrata, the hospital recorded 257 people killed and 949 people wounded in February and March 2011. Those casualties included 22 women and eight children. Libyan doctors told United Nations investigators that Tripoli’s morgues contained more than 200 corpses following fighting in late February 2011, of whom two were female. The disparity between male and female casualties suggested that Gaddafi regime forces targeted male combatants in a civil war and did not indiscriminately attack civilians. More widely, Muammar Gaddafi’s 40-year record of appalling human rights abuses did not include large-scale attacks on Libyan civilians""*

Mostly that its 2022, and not 1950s.

Why that matters is couple of reasons:

* Movement toward renewables. 

* Plenty of US domestic and Canadian supply. 

* Much simpler to trade than to wage wars. 

Couple of simple anecdotes:

1. It is widely held that US went into Iraq for Oil. It did not. As Trump said ""We did not keep the oil"". Iraq always got to control all of its oil fields. The invasion was ideological in nature, and had zero considerations for economic impact on either US or Iraq.

2. It is widely held that Russia invaded Ukraine for their oil and gas capacity. Russia has plenty domestic capacity that it can't even tap on its own, they literally invite companies like Exxon, Shell, and BP to develop them. In a world where we move toward renewables and infrastructure is expensive, nobody has a lot of interest in starting from scratch with Ukrainian gas and oil.",635fb511a84341992769c2c68ca066c06afe2d17,True,False,,,,,0,1647377339,,0,{},i0sqmkz,False,t3_tenm86,False,True,t3_tenm86,/r/geopolitics/comments/tenm86/reading_a_book_about_the_great_game_for_energy/i0sqmkz/,1647377356,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647348539.0,

Of course a country can be sustainable in many different ways, defining sustainability is actually very, very hard since there is so many ways to approach it. Considering sustainability in a geopolitical aspect is obviously not easy but I would suspect things like independent of foreign products, goods and services, tech development, energy independency, and being able to compete longterm in developing crucial fields would be some of the factors to consider. 

The moment a country isn't leading in certain technological developments, or need energy/food imports it'll have to grant concessions to other countries. America probably were pretty sustainable in some sense back in the 90s since they hadn't started outsourcing much of its production and much of it's know-how to Japan/Taiwan/China.

Every time a dictator is overthrown in Africa, the next one in is just as bad if not worse, and that isn't because of foreign corporations, that's just the internal politics of those nations. Sadly, this shows very little sign of improving apart from the odd exception like Rwanda. 

Africa is blessed with resources, but that is something that more often than not leads to governments neglecting their people. This is the resource curse. More often than not, a good business environment with no corruption will lead to a country being far richer than a nation with plenty of oil, diamonds, etc. 

&gt;	Just as leadership is now starting to pass to China/India

China has developed a lot, but India hasn’t. Population is only one part of the equation and it's as much of a blessing as it is a curse. India's economy is very poor, even in 2022, especially compared to China. This is mainly due to how poorly managed the economy has been since independence. The kind of growth China has seen is not something that is inevitable in Africa or even India. 

China and India are also just climbing back to where they previously stood in the world. The 1800s and 1900s were a poor time for both people's who have normally enjoyed being relatively wealthy/poweful. The same can't be said for nearly all of Africa.

What you haven't considered is that in your example there was an entire world war which was the catalysis for the change you are talking about.

India is concerned about itself, if China and the West are competing with it India doesn't care so long as it is not threatened, which of course is happening.

Another example of long lasting consequences is British colonialism, which has caused immeasurable strife to this day. As far as India is concerned, the west sees it as a rag to be used and thrown.

&gt;And the West has no real use for Pakistan. Seems to me a re-alignment makes sense, but I suppose Cold War alliances can run deep.

Pakistan is a hedge against India the same way India is a hedge against China. The west will never completely let go of Pakistan for this reason.

There are still consequences today of the decisions made in the past. Let's not act like old leaders dying changes that. 

Making a militaristic decision in the 1970s pushed India closer to the USSR, which led to further cooperation even after the war of 71 ended. This same antagonism developed as a consequence of the Indo-USSR relationship and is well proven with how the west sanctioned India during its nuclear tests.

# DIFFERENT PLAYERS

Here is a brief [article describing the various bodies for foreign policymaking in China.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/app5.121)  Here is another article [Who decides China’s foreign policy?: The role of central government, provincial-level authorities and state-owned enterprises](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2021/11/who-decides-chinas-foreign-policy).

This is particularly true with economic matters.  Xi Jinping and other Chinese officials love to go around various countries making promises of investment etc. And people actually take their word for it. You see it with the following

[China, With $400 Billion Iran Deal, Could Deepen Influence in Mideast](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/27/world/middleeast/china-iran-deal.html)

But history and recent events show it's not going to happen, Most Chinese companies buying [Iranian oil are small refineries](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Chinese-Teapot-Refineries-Ramp-Up-Oil-Imports-From-Iran.html), and China has invested 3-4 times more in Iraq than Iran.

There are many within the CCP that don't like China getting too close to Russia, especially after the invasion. Here are two articles

[China Declared Its Russia Friendship Had ‘No Limits.’ It’s Having Second Thoughts.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-russia-xi-putin-ukraine-war-11646279098)

[China has already decided to send economic aid to Russia in Ukraine conflict, US officials fear](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/china-has-already-decided-to-send-economic-aid-to-russia-in-ukraine-conflict-us-officials-fear)

You could spin this off as Western propaganda, but those concerns have sound geopolitical logic and interest behind them.

# CHINESE VIEW GEOPOLITICS THROUGH HISTORY

China places more emphasis on history when studying a country, and when it comes to foreign relations compared to Western countries. This is particularly true for countries it has a long relations with. Here is a sampling of the scholars who study Southeast Asia in the 1990s.

&gt;Many were trained in history or international relations; according to an early 1990s survey, 43 percent of China’s Southeast Asianists were trained in history, 14 percent in economics, and 12 percent in international relations/politics. Accordingly, the work of these scholars tends to manifest a historical and nation-state perspective. 

[https://kyotoreview.org/issue-3-nations-and-stories/liu-hong-on-southeast-asian-studies-in-greater-china/](https://kyotoreview.org/issue-3-nations-and-stories/liu-hong-on-southeast-asian-studies-in-greater-china/)

[For some Chinese Russia's invasion of Ukraine reminds them of the Soviet Union and the Korean War. Some Chinese scholars believe that China was dragged into the War. It damaged relations with the US, and essentially put the 7th Fleet across the Taiwan Strait. There is a huge debate among academics on how much did China know about the invasion](https://www.google.ca/books/edition/China_s_Road_to_the_Korean_War/kL03BAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=China+and+Korean+War&amp;printsec=frontcover).

# CHINA'S THREE IRRECONSIBLE OBJECTIVES

According to former Singaporean diplomat

&gt;First, China wants to preserve respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference as key norms of international relations. The reasons for this can be summarised in three words: Tibet, Xinjiang and Taiwan. The Russian invasion of Ukraine was a direct challenge to these norms.  
  
Second, China wants to preserve its partnership with Russia because Beijing has no other partner anywhere with Russia’s strategic weight. Beijing and Moscow also share a common discomfort with a Western-oriented global order. China has not criticised Russia and I do not expect it to ever do so. Beijing hopes to play some role in brokering a ceasefire or a settlement, but China is not and cannot be a neutral party.  
  
But at the same time, China is much more integrated into the global order than Russia and has benefited much more than Russia from that order.  
  
Calling U.S.-China competition a ""new Cold War"" is fundamentally misleading. The U.S. and the Soviet Union led two separate systems that were only tangentially connected to each other. Their competition was between systems. The U.S. and China are both core components of a single global system and compete within this system. This is far more complicated than the binary competition of the Cold War.

# WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT EUROPE OR RUSSIA?

Even if you believe there is a Cold War, you have to ask which is more important a Neutral EU or Russia as a partner?

It really depends on your view of economics. If you feel natural resources are more important than technology then it's Russia. If you feel technology is its Europe.

What is the whole point of the BRI if China has bad relations with Europe? The whole trans-Eurasian railway is effectively dead right now.

# PERSONAL OPINION

My view is Xi Jinping got played by Putin, and Xi is out of his league when it comes to foreign policy. It is why China is contradicting itself every week with regards to the invasion. They are running around like a headless chicken.

Anyone remember the zombie bank issue from 2002? The amount of bad loans on the 4 majors when China had them IPO? They did solve that problem so that no one talks about it anymore.  
China is not going to implode or breakdown. It will probably gradually decrease in economic competitiveness via demographics and gov't interference in the economy. But that's a long way from 'destabilizing'. As far as the US cutting off oil, the US could do that, but only in the scenario of a Taiwan invasion. And don't forget China is developing a blue water navy.  
And guess who else is facing a declining population in the near future? The United States. Without immigration, we'd already have a declining population. Fertility is currently 1.638 children per woman, below the replacement rate of 2.1.  Anyone here think it'll cause an implosion of US gov't and society? I didn't think so.  
With a huge communist power threatening the free world, in some ways I wish China would be taken down a notch. Even better would be to democratize.

Legitimate or illegitimate, those reasons are just as real of reasons now as they were on 23rd February.

Russia invaded Ukraine with the plan of walking away with a fait accompli in 48-72 hours, and failed. The war is 2 1/2 weeks old now. Russia was caught flat-footed by the magnitude of the sanctions that came in response to the invasion. Russia is partially cut off from mechanical parts needed to maintain military capabilities. Russia might default on its debt tomorrow. They've stirred into action a lot of Europe into further anti-Russian actions, most specifically Germany. Their actions these last three weeks eroded years if not decades of trust with businesses.

My personal opinion is that Russia is in a worse position than on the 23rd of February, in almost every single aspect. The goals are the same. The situation is worse. Retreating now is undoubtedly more painful than retreating would have been three weeks ago. What so you do? Doubling down is IMO was Putin has always done.

[],False,,LeveonNumber1,,,[],,,,text,t2_2k3c8zst,False,False,"The IMF has already included the Yuan alongside the Dollar, Pound, Yen, and Euro as a reserve currency for awhile. 

A far as I know the petrochemical chemical market is the only one where dollars have a virtual monopoly on transactions. US trade with Saudi Arabia has been in decline for awhile. I'm not sure this move is as important as it may seem at a first glance, rather just affirming what has already been the case for several years now (that is that the Yuan is being considered as an alternative to paying in dollars, specifically for some oil sales with Chiness corporations, unlike the post title which implies that Saudi Arabia would only accept RNB, which isn't true)

I feel that the more interesting conversation to have here is about the Yuan. The only tangible barrier to it's widespread foreign adoption is that unlike the Dollar, Pound, Euro, or Yen, it's value is not allowed to freely float as determined by the market. Rather the foreign exchange market with regards to the Yuan is tightly controlled by the Chinese Government, allowing them to control the price of the Yuan. For a while the Yuan was hard pegged to an artificially low value against the dollar to boost exports in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis, and many economist and politicians believe that the Yuan's drop in value in 2018 was engineered by the Chinese government to keep an advantage for Chinese exports, though this is not universally agreed upon and some even argue that this had more to do with an overvalued dollar. 

Chinese desire to control the exchange rate of the Yuan seems contradictory to their desire to see the Yuan widely adopted as an intermediary. Indeed I'm not even sure they really want the latter. This deal would only encompass exchanges between the Saudi's and the Chinese, not the Saudi's and the rest of the world, and I'm not quite convinced it demonstrates a desire to dethrone the dollar. 

Many economist think it is impossible for them Yuan to be widely used as an intermediary currency and also for China to maintain such tight control over it's exchange rate, and given the choice between the two it seems that China much prefers the latter option.",3c1c41e87a88546ec7f0e7e3fe953346f8136152,True,False,,,,,0,1647366472,,0,{},i0rygq9,False,t3_terpbi,False,True,t3_terpbi,/r/geopolitics/comments/terpbi/saudi_arabia_in_talks_to_replace_usd_with_yuan/i0rygq9/,1647366486,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647337672.0,

For more than 40 years, Saudi Arabia has traded oil exclusively in dollars. This is one of the main sources of dollar reserves on which part of the global financial system is based, the petrodollar. In this scenario, oil producers sell the fossil fuel in dollars and invest the revenues in dollar-denominated market, sustaining U.S as the World's financial superpower.

Lately, however, Saudis have grown angry over the lack of American support for their intervention in Yemen and Biden's administration attempt to strike a deal with Iran over its nuclear program; in addition, the unexpected U.S withdraw from from Afghanistan, shocked Saudi officials.

Following this, it's crucial to notice that China buys more than 25% of the Saudi's exports.

Putin definitely wants to avoid egg on his face, so securing Crimea and Donbas are crucial for him. Somehow, he thinks his current tactics are going to bring Ukraine to cede to his wishes on this.

It certainly is not unheard of in world history, in fact it's rather common that a military invasion focused on specific goals often succeeds, at least in terms of treaties and border changes. 

First step would be a cease fire after Ukraine formally recognizes Donbas as an independent state and renounces all claims to Crimea - and perhaps to the coastal towns on the Black Sea as well.

Saudi Arabia using Yuan for Chinese oil sales doesn't remove a demand for US treasuries in general. Their value is based on having an extremely low risk; the US is not one to default on their debts like Argentina, Russia, etc. have been known to do.   


The value in US debt is comes from being the largest economy in the world for the last century, sitting on \~30% of the world's total wealth (\~$20 trillion low interest debt stacked against \~$130T in total national wealth), being the most powerful and secure country militarily (pretty much immune to external geopolitics at a macro scale), being the largest oil &amp; food producer in the world and so on....it's an incredibly secure place to hold money and hedge against risk.

To point, when was Russia ever India's ""friend""? India maintains good relations with Russia for a few reasons:

1. Getting right to first bid on their weapons, so that Pakistan doesn't get the opportunity to buy the best stuff (probably not needed now, since they are buying Chinese)

2. Giving Russia enough of a rope that they won't instinctively side with China, if things were to go haywire on that front

3. Keeping a door open on cheap petroleum-derived products from a non-Middle East region, due to how contentiously the Kashmir issue gets used by populist leaders in Islamic world

4. Having a reliable veto in UNSC when the western nations spontaneously decide to care about _values_

5. Keeping good relations in Central Asia, through the amount of influence Russia wields there, and so on...

For some reason people struggle to realise there are many independent news and communication networks out there, and not everybody believes or follows the same narratives. African leaders have developed their own interpretations of how the world works, and won't just 'believe' whatever western 'influencers' want them to believe.

They also understandably prioritise their own regional interests and Russia and China are both important reliable and historically 'trustable' actors there (China has been the biggest trading partner of Africa for a while now), unlike say some western nations who don't exactly have the best track record there, even in relatively recent times.

In regards to your questions,

Don't see how EU expanding it's military really matters that much. If the EU decides to sell arms there, it'll just be another entrant in the market. The age of military 'adventures' are over, as it's too costly, as the 'outsider'/invader will always be outnumbered and have to manufacture consent from the home grown population. You will get better returns by just trading. Not to mention, the big hit ones soft-power will get without a good international justification. Again, actors outside your echo chambers aren't blind, and will respond appropriately, for example, a devaluation in longer term trust, and being more receptive to your competitors.

If you mean take Russia's arms market share, Russia is already considered a 'farming superpower' to some extent, pretty sure is said to benefit a lot from climate change in regards to that - which is important given the burgeoning African population that will need more and more food.

In my opinion, in real terms, China has nothing to lose by continuing in their support for the Russian's, and the value of their strategic partnership is such that it is well worth whatever second hand scorn the West has levied upon them over their reaction to the crisis in Ukraine. Until we actually *do* something to them, what real reason could they possibly have to apply sanctions, or even cancel existing contracts that benefit China?

An interesting thing I learned recently is that many countries experiencing difficulties with their relationship with the Western World tend to operate with ""anti-sanctions clauses"" that are signed in the initial contract. According to many anti-sanctions clauses, the relevant parties are obliged to perform their obligations regardless of the imposition of sanctions. The performance of obligations is not suspended or extended and the imposition of sanctions is identified as not a force majeure. A consequence of this is that the party in default is responsible for the undue performance of obligations.

Of course, the reality is that many companies can and will find a way around all this, but I'm not entirely certain that China would evaluate the situation in Ukraine as a worthy cause to poison the well with Russia. 

An uncomfortable question with rising oil and gas prices, shockwaves across European economies and the sanctions, thus far, failure at achieving any meaningful results on the ground, is that the West simply cannot afford to sanction the far more globally critical Chinese economy except as an absolute last resort. 

So China is free to trade with Russia and reap the various benefits of an alliance with an authoritarian state with whom it shares a common enemy. For all the reports that indicate that this has had a negative effect on China's goals to integrate Taiwan, I personally fail to see how that is so. The war is not over and the occupied territories are increasing. That does not indicate the Russian's are losing, but rather that they are winning slowly. If Russia seizes Ukraine and suffers no consequences beyond being sanctioned by the West, then I think that Taiwan should be very concerned about the level of support it can expect to receive from the US in the event of a Chinese attempt at ""anschluss"".

With regards to Ukraine, I think that China intended to foster good relations with Ukraine, however the situation on the ground has shifted so rapidly that they are simply unwilling to bet on the continued survival of Ukraine as a state. From a perspective of trade and the value that the Chinese derive from fostering a strong relationship with Russia, this leaves the Ukrainian/Chinese relationship at a bit of a dead-end until this conflict is resolved one way or another.",90e37a106859f8d2715267088f09f8b59af78456,True,False,,,,,0,1647351726,,0,{},i0qxv70,True,t3_teijzm,False,True,t1_i0qkwzd,/r/geopolitics/comments/teijzm/how_overlapping_core_interests_reinforces_the/i0qxv70/,1647351739,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647322926.0,

No one can really fill the void America will leave, there is no real winner this time imo. This is more like the 14th century.

The European states have different visions and ideals for the future, but I believe they can peacefully co-exist. The main issue for that western bloc is north America and France. France doesn't really need explaining, it has been in perpetual state of political violence for half a decade. And is further devolving into some kind of ""years of lead"".

What you see in North America is a dividing line, several separate visions for the future. Most of which envision that future devoid of their political/ideological/cultural enemies. Why is this? It is a giant empire, parallel cultures and ways of life have formed in this 20 million square kilometer state. (USA/Canada)

Over time, the centralization of power to giant urban centers overrides more rural/town cultures. Creating alienation which leads to organized but asymmetric violence. This alienation has been capitalized on by political opportunists, but whom have really only fed off the nostalgia of the past greatness and not much else. If you look at 1960's Afghanistan under the democratization efforts, something similar happened. It lead to a fracture, urban-rural divide and a slow smoldering civil war much like the USA has today. It was only the USSR invasion of Afghanistan that postponed that civil war, instead turning it into an insurgency. You could try as Germany did and turn every large city into it's own federal state, but I believe it is too late and even Germany only postponed it; that country has a 3 way divide.

As the west either is barred from cheap exports by an embargo or loses the reserve currency, we will see their societies fall into a permanent state of austerity. Leading to unprecedented political violence. It has already crossed the point of no return in militarized politics, similar to Yugoslavia. For several years we have watched reactionaries battle in the streets with other factions, all factions growing. Street brawls and insurrections much like Weimar Germany. Extremist agitators of all types take advantage and accelerate the chaos, the fabric of the society is permanently shattered and through necessity during austerity people will increasingly join the ranks of extrajudicial political movements.

There is no real political continuation of the Anglo-American status quo, only really a prolonging it. The ""External enemy to tame"" and nostalgia for the past really won't help the west discipline itself. Far too divided and far too little bread and circuses to go around. The Anglo-American empire can be summed up as ""Weimarislavistan"".

There would be little will to send eu forces to african countries. At most I would expect an increase of activity in the med, mostly to prevent mass migration that will accelerate with climate issues, as well as famine. 

If this drags on africa will be among the most affected. Many regimes are already unstable. Western countries is already stockpiling food. The voters are already angry because their energy and food bills have increased. 

The conflict is also not just about food production in europe. 30 % of raw materials for ferilizer comes from russia and ukraine. These are not replaceable, at the very least in the short term. Obviously western states will horde fertilizer and drive prices up, resulting in lower yeilds globally, but in particular in poorer countries. 

Even in an optimistic scenario europe will have to deal with 10 million refugies. It will be a massive bill to pay while the native population will be worse of with the ever rising cost of living. I doubt there will be much political will to pay for the disaster that is to happen in africa. Even if there is a will it would be tricky to balance the budgets. Basically every european nation will spend a lot more on defence, some already signaling an increase of 1 % of gdp. This is particular true for countries that in the past have spent a lot on hunanitarian aid, as they often spent significantly less on defense. It is also no secret that these development aid budgets is unpopular in many countries. Hence, the portion of those budgets Going to africa will be the easiest to cut.

We can't rely on the veracity of what Putin is saying to the world, because almost everything his administration puts out is a lie. He is trying to project the image that he wants peace in an attempt to curb sanctions.

We should instead look at Russia's actions to judge their intent. Hiring mercenaries from Syria indicates that Putin is in this for the long haul. Willingness to use thermobaric weapons, to shell civilian areas, the attempt to encircle Kyiv--this shows that Putin is determined to win. Reports from Putin's aides also report that he's been increasingly erratic and aggressive in recent years, possibly due to steroid use or declining mental health. To me this suggests that Putin is not acting logically. While a logical person would probably accept Crimea and Donbas as a win, I don't think that's the lens through which we should analyze Putin's actions. 

Putin wants to go down in the history books as the man who restored Russia to greatness. He has tunnel vision, and can't accept that this simply isn't in the cards. I think it will take a lot more punishment before he is willing to let go of his ego--there may be no way to get him to stop.

But assuming he hasn't completely lost his senses, and is still concerned with self preservation. He cannot have possibly expected sanctions to hit so hard and so deep into the Russian economy. If he continues along this line, he risks deep resentment from his populous.

Even if surveys are still saying the majority support the war in Russia (though... If you were russian, would you really openly say otherwise on a government survey?)

1. Would-have-been US allies might not be feeling so sure about teaming up with the US. These countries look at Ukraine, which was a staunch US ally, and the state it is being reduced to. While it may well be true that the US is supporting them literally to the maximum extent possible, the fact remains that the US ally and NATO aspirant is being razed to the ground. 

2. Now that the financial systems have been weaponized at scale, countries which are not firmly in the US camp, might feel iffy about having dollar denominated deposits, or even gold deposited in banks in countries in the US camp. They will be wary that should something cause significant enough displeasure stateside, their assets could be frozen out completely. 

3. Russia remains and will continue to remain a large provider of oil and gas in the medium term. They are already gearing up to use the Chinese alternative to SWIFT and to do trade in non-USD currencies. This effect could easily extend to other countries which are customers of Russia. China too could start asking customers to do business in the ""alternative"" systems. 

4. Countries like Turkey, India, Pakistan, Brazil, Malay, Indonesia, Egypt, etc. (maybe around another 20 - 30 middle powers) are overall pro-US but not ""staunch"" US allies and in many cases disagree with US policy and often enough chart their own course. Given the black and white with us or against us attitude that the US often seems to take, these countries could choose not to deepen their relationship with the US. Especially with military hardware. If you get into a fight that the US doesn't approve of, you might as well find yourself frozen out of spares, or intel, or whatever else. They might also prefer to have the ability to cut off their national systems and international trade arrangements from the US dominated system, if need be. Most of these countries have a non-negligible likelihood of being run by a populist / nationalist leader - which increases the likelihood of these kind of events. 

5. The US seems to make a joke of its own foreign policy and its consistency. a) Trump randomly reversing past agreements, and b) US officials suddenly rushing to make friends with Venezuela after shunning Maduro for so long. There things like ""consistency"" and ""loyalty"" are very important in most cultures. Countries with a functioning government and society typically do not like their status to oscillate between friend and foe depending on what the US finds momentarily convenient.

A somewhat startling article on how Africa (yes, I commit the cardinal sin of treating the continent as some undifferentiated entity) perceives the Ukraine-Russia conflict.

* Although the condemnation of Russian aggression by Kenya's UN ambassador made the deepest impression, the author draws attention to a less-noticed segment of his speech on how this was merely the latest instance of powerful Western countries flouting international law at will. Personally, I get the distinct impression that the Africans think it is a ""White Man's War""; multiple nations disapprove of Ukraine's [recruitment drive for combatants](https://www.dw.com/en/ukraines-bid-to-recruit-fighters-from-africa-sparks-uproar/a-61049323). African sympathy is decidedly muted by [racist treatment](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/2/more-racism-at-ukrainian-borders) of Africans as they fled the country, and perceived double-standards at European attitudes towards refugees. 

* As with Crimea, a significant number of African nations abstained from voting to condemn Russia, most notably South Africa. The author notes that many like-minded autocratic regimes have enjoyed Russian support in recent years, such as Mali and Central African Republic. The fixed feelings between sovereignty/self-determination and irredentism/unfair post-colonial borders is also highlighted.

* The impacts on food supply are particularly worrying as both parties are among the top grain exporters and the conflict drags on to the spring sowing season. Adding to uncertainly, ****China [recently announced](https://www.reuters.com/business/china-ensure-agricultural-product-supplies-including-grains-2022-03-05/) its wheat crop could be the  ""worst in history"". African nations, which have already suffered though plagues of locusts in 2021, are among the least able to bear inflated prices that have hit 20-year highs.

Some questions:

- If the EU does militarise, what are the consequences for the continent? Russia has been a major arms dealer to many African nations and organisations.

- There is [some speculation](https://www.voanews.com/a/can-china-shield-africa-from-fallout-of-sanctions-against-russia/6477448.html) that China could step up as a trading partner, but there is a supply-demand mismatch (especially in agriculture commodities). Is it feasible?

- What other takeaways might the continent have?",eafd5156ecaf1f3369da62ad1f3226915f151e5f,True,False,,,,,0,1647337464,,0,{},i0qb5n4,True,t3_tel8vo,False,True,t3_tel8vo,/r/geopolitics/comments/tel8vo/analyzing_the_russiaukraine_conflict_from_an/i0qb5n4/,1647337478,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647308664.0,

Never mind the color revolutions that were shaking things up as those didn't have the right character for these folks, it was the core group of strongman dictators who were finally going to bring about the change that the world needed.

And I remember when that group included folks like Hugo Chavez, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Muammar Gaddafi, and look what happened to those guys. Now more recently it is Putin and Xi Jinping who are going to do it.

Russias military losses are so unsustainable after two weeks that they have already been technically decimated using ukrainian figures.  At this rate of attrition we are looking at complete force (original force deployed 80% lost in manpower) dismemberment by the six month point. 

The ukranians have a huge reserve of civilian population to draw upon, and are being resupplied in weapons and (to a lesser extent, but ramping up) humanitarian aid food water etc by the west. They have actually *gained* hardware as far as we can tell from all the captured an abandoned russian units which are mostly fully interoperable with their own ex ussr vehicles.

And this is before we look at the domestic economic situation with a russian default likely like, today and the whole supply chain collapsing sector by sector, brain drain, capital flight the whole works is caving in russia minute by minute.

The most russia can hope to achieve is stalemate militarily at this point, with the hope the humanitarian  cost will be too much for the Ukrainians to bear in order to get favourable terms in at least face terms for an off ramp negotiated withdrawal. 

All that is stopping russian withdrawal now is putins bruised ego. They have already failed catastrophically in military objective terms and in any fair assessment of the cost benefits of this misadvised farargo. They will not 'succeed' in their objectives before russia collapses into civil war.

I shouldn't make predictions, but I predict a no nato agreement, where ukraine is allowed to enter the EU, federal independence for the donbass regions(with promise of referenda), water for crimea which will remain russian and some form of agreement that zelensky does not stand at next elections.
Basically status quo ante with some concessions.

Russia has no chips left apart from nuclear oblivion and even I don't beleive putin is that mad, but I definitely beleive he has no line of authority through the military (who have been constantly undermined by him) to have the order carried out.

Additionally, Putin will be killed by the Oligarchs. His only way of surviving personally is continuing the war until sanctions against Oligarchs are lifted or until he dies.

If Russia is failing with infantry and tanks (which it is) and it has lost the element of surprise and speed (which it has) and momentum (which it partially has), then the next step is terror. That means chemical / biological warfare and short range, low payload nuclear weapons, razing cities if neccessary.

Russia does have the means to make Ukraine submit and it will use them. That being said, holding down Ukraine is another matter. I expect they will turn it into another Belarus situation with a puppet government.

This being said, there is still a massive question whether the war ends there. As stated, Putin will be forced to wage war until sanctions against the Oligarchs are lifted. If he stops, the Oligarchs have no reason to keep him alive, and every reason to kill him. That means Moldova, Finland and potentially the Baltic countries are next on the hit list. Keep in mind the goal for Putin would no longer be geopolitical per se. It would be personally motivated. That changes the calculus for who to invade and whether nuclear weapons are on the table.

Beyond the above, there is also the obvious point that this is war. Spillover conflict and mistakes (or false flags in the fog of war) can also arise and unexpected things can happen as a result.

South Korea's economy is heavily dependent on chaebols (family run megacorporations). In fact just Samsung alone is responsible for something like 15% of Korea's GDP. To put that into comparison in the US Amazon which many are claiming to be a monopoly makes up just 1% of US GDP. As such these corporations have a enormous amount of power as well as a monopoly on most sectors of the economy. Monopoly laws are weak in Korea and chaebols can muscle into any industry and kill all small and medium size businesses by undercutting the competition and they regularly do this. And unlike corporations in the US where one can conceivably move up to the top these are family run, if your not a family member then no matter your talent you will not hold leadership positions. Therefore you have a economy where business are regularly crushed by megacorporations and these megacorporations are run by a elite class which intermarrys between each other and those in key government position.

For economist excerpt :- 

 At approximately 1am on March 3rd, Priday and 15 other volunteers crammed into a white van with civilian licence plates, bound for western Ukraine. A yellow van followed with another 15. A Bulgarian in a black hoodie, who’d drunk a number of Tyskie beers while waiting at the Cicada, sat next to Priday for the hour-long drive. He worked as a nightclub bouncer in London and, moments after he entered the van, confessed to being a neo-Nazi. “My plan is to kill as many Russians as I can,” he explained on repeat.The two vans were waved through each of the six checkpoints they passed. The volunteers were dropped off at a Ukrainian army base, a collection of yellow buildings with red tiled roofs, just before 3am. They were led inside one of the buildings to a room with no heating and 25 beds without sheets. The Ukrainians checked everyone’s passports and turned away one prospective volunteer, a Russian who worked in Dublin. He was told, according to Priday, that there was “no way” he could sign up.Priday was woken around 8am by a Ukrainian soldier banging a drum. In a canteen the new arrivals were served a breakfast of noodles and a “weird-tasting juice that smelled like gasoline”. Priday expected staff to assess the skills of the foreigners and attempt to slot them into suitable roles – many volunteers had no military experience. He thought he might be sent to a refugee camp to help the wounded and teach basic first aid. Instead, the co-ordinators explained that volunteers were expected to fight on the frontline. “You were told that you would go where you are most needed,” Priday said. They would get three to five days’ training. Staff informed them that the first two days would be devoted to rudimentary map-reading and medical skills; on the third day weapons would be handed out and volunteers would practise firing them on a range; then all of them – regardless of their prior experience – would be dispatched to the front. A Belarusian anarchist who had been through the training confirmed the abbreviated nature of it. He said he was told that new recruits were destined for Kyiv.The foreign legion does now appear to be adapting. Online application forms for new recruits ask for candidates with “military/combat/medical experience”. 1843 magazine has heard reports that a new commander has been appointed. Veterans are now being winnowed out from those who have never seen combat – the latter now receive three weeks of training. A spokesman for Ukraine’s ministry of defence said that “we are focused on trained people. Untrained people are not going to be sent to the front”.Priday was surprised by the naivety of those eager to fight. Some volunteers likened the Ukrainian struggle to that of the Kurds in Iraq against Islamic State, but he knew how the Russians were a different kind of enemy. “This is nothing like fighting terrorists,” Priday tried to explain to other recruits. “You’re fighting a real country, with a real army, with a real navy, with special forces and heavy weaponry and superb tactical capabilities. And it’s all being conducted by a crazy man.” As he said to his fellow volunteers, no one seemed to have thought through what would happen if a foreigner like Priday – a NATO veteran – were to be captured by the Russians. “Prisoners like me would be a gold mine for Russian propaganda,” Priday said.The most troubling turn of events came just after breakfast. The volunteers lined up and were told that it was time to sign a contract: this stipulated that their pay would be 7,000 hryvnia a month ($230 at the time) and that they would have to remain in the Ukrainian foreign legion for the duration of the war. The contract put them under the same obligations as all Ukrainian men: under martial law, declared by Zelensky on February 24th, no man aged between 18 and 60 is allowed to leave the country. “If you’ve got any commitments at home, you’re going to lose them,” Priday told me. People might lose their jobs or even their houses, if they fall behind on rent or mortgage payments: “7,000 hyrvnia a month is not sustainable”.Two other sources confirmed to 1843 magazine that the contract binds volunteers to serve for an indefinite length of time. (By way of comparison, the French Foreign Legion requires people to sign up for five years in the first instance.) None of the volunteers 1843 magazine spoke to had been told about the terms of contract before they made the crossing into Ukraine. A source in the Ukrainian ministry of defence also told 1843 magazine that the contract was for an unlimited period. He said that, in practice, those who no longer wished to fight could apply for a discharge and were unlikely to be refused. Between 20 and 30 volunteers have already been allowed to leave after signing on. The ministry of defence spokesman denied that the contract requires volunteers to sign on indefinitely but refused to share a copy.The terms of the contract are clearly giving some people pause. A number of would-be volunteers in Lviv in western Ukraine, interviewed by 1843 magazine, said they would like to help the war effort but are wary of signing the document. They are now looking for other ways to offer assistance.Priday implored the other volunteers not to sign. “I was trying to explain to them what martial law really means – and that it’s up to Ukraine to decide when it ends. It can be extended and extended. But no one at the base was explaining this to the volunteers. They just kept reiterating that you were getting paid for your services.”To me it’s deceiving,” Priday said. “They’re selling you a dream – You can help the Ukrainian people! – but then they’re throwing you into the worst place possible in a war zone.” Priday refused to sign and said he was immediately asked to leave the barracks. He was still able to convince nearly 20 aspiring volunteers not to sign the contract, he claims.One foreigner who did sign was a 21-year old from Britain with no military experience. He told Priday he’d been working dead-end jobs for years and his frustration had mounted and mounted. He flew to Poland without telling his housemates or his parents: no one in Britain knew that he had gone. Priday felt like the man was signing his “death warrant”. (The man has subsequently returned from Ukraine.)Less than ten hours after he’d entered Ukraine, Priday left the camp and hitchhiked back to the border.

&gt;  
&gt;For economist :-  
&gt;  
&gt;At approximately 1am on March 3rd, Priday and 15 other volunteers crammed into a white van with civilian licence plates, bound for western Ukraine. A yellow van followed with another 15. A Bulgarian in a black hoodie, who’d drunk a number of Tyskie beers while waiting at the Cicada, sat next to Priday for the hour-long drive. He worked as a nightclub bouncer in London and, moments after he entered the van, confessed to being a neo-Nazi. “My plan is to kill as many Russians as I can,” he explained on repeat.  
&gt;  
&gt;The two vans were waved through each of the six checkpoints they passed. The volunteers were dropped off at a Ukrainian army base, a collection of yellow buildings with red tiled roofs, just before 3am. They were led inside one of the buildings to a room with no heating and 25 beds without sheets. The Ukrainians checked everyone’s passports and turned away one prospective volunteer, a Russian who worked in Dublin. He was told, according to Priday, that there was “no way” he could sign up.  
&gt;  
&gt;Priday was woken around 8am by a Ukrainian soldier banging a drum. In a canteen the new arrivals were served a breakfast of noodles and a “weird-tasting juice that smelled like gasoline”. Priday expected staff to assess the skills of the foreigners and attempt to slot them into suitable roles – many volunteers had no military experience. He thought he might be sent to a refugee camp to help the wounded and teach basic first aid.  
&gt;  
&gt;Instead, the co-ordinators explained that volunteers were expected to fight on the frontline. “You were told that you would go where you are most needed,” Priday said. They would get three to five days’ training. Staff informed them that the first two days would be devoted to rudimentary map-reading and medical skills; on the third day weapons would be handed out and volunteers would practise firing them on a range; then all of them – regardless of their prior experience – would be dispatched to the front. A Belarusian anarchist who had been through the training confirmed the abbreviated nature of it. He said he was told that new recruits were destined for Kyiv.  
&gt;  
&gt;The foreign legion does now appear to be adapting. Online application forms for new recruits ask for candidates with “military/combat/medical experience”. 1843 magazine has heard reports that a new commander has been appointed. Veterans are now being winnowed out from those who have never seen combat – the latter now receive three weeks of training. A spokesman for Ukraine’s ministry of defence said that “we are focused on trained people. Untrained people are not going to be sent to the front”.  
&gt;  
&gt;Priday was surprised by the naivety of those eager to fight. Some volunteers likened the Ukrainian struggle to that of the Kurds in Iraq against Islamic State, but he knew how the Russians were a different kind of enemy. “This is nothing like fighting terrorists,” Priday tried to explain to other recruits. “You’re fighting a real country, with a real army, with a real navy, with special forces and heavy weaponry and superb tactical capabilities. And it’s all being conducted by a crazy man.” As he said to his fellow volunteers, no one seemed to have thought through what would happen if a foreigner like Priday – a NATO veteran – were to be captured by the Russians. “Prisoners like me would be a gold mine for Russian propaganda,” Priday said.  
&gt;  
&gt;The most troubling turn of events came just after breakfast. The volunteers lined up and were told that it was time to sign a contract: this stipulated that their pay would be 7,000 hryvnia a month ($230 at the time) and that they would have to remain in the Ukrainian foreign legion for the duration of the war. The contract put them under the same obligations as all Ukrainian men: under martial law, declared by Zelensky on February 24th, no man aged between 18 and 60 is allowed to leave the country. “If you’ve got any commitments at home, you’re going to lose them,” Priday told me. People might lose their jobs or even their houses, if they fall behind on rent or mortgage payments: “7,000 hyrvnia a month is not sustainable”.  
&gt;  
&gt;Two other sources confirmed to 1843 magazine that the contract binds volunteers to serve for an indefinite length of time. (By way of comparison, the French Foreign Legion requires people to sign up for five years in the first instance.) None of the volunteers 1843 magazine spoke to had been told about the terms of contract before they made the crossing into Ukraine. A source in the Ukrainian ministry of defence also told 1843 magazine that the contract was for an unlimited period. He said that, in practice, those who no longer wished to fight could apply for a discharge and were unlikely to be refused. Between 20 and 30 volunteers have already been allowed to leave after signing on. The ministry of defence spokesman denied that the contract requires volunteers to sign on indefinitely but refused to share a copy.  
&gt;  
&gt;The terms of the contract are clearly giving some people pause. A number of would-be volunteers in Lviv in western Ukraine, interviewed by 1843 magazine, said they would like to help the war effort but are wary of signing the document. They are now looking for other ways to offer assistance.  
&gt;  
&gt;Priday implored the other volunteers not to sign. “I was trying to explain to them what martial law really means – and that it’s up to Ukraine to decide when it ends. It can be extended and extended. But no one at the base was explaining this to the volunteers. They just kept reiterating that you were getting paid for your services.”  
&gt;  
&gt;To me it’s deceiving,” Priday said. “They’re selling you a dream – You can help the Ukrainian people! – but then they’re throwing you into the worst place possible in a war zone.” Priday refused to sign and said he was immediately asked to leave the barracks. He was still able to convince nearly 20 aspiring volunteers not to sign the contract, he claims.  
&gt;  
&gt;One foreigner who did sign was a 21-year old from Britain with no military experience. He told Priday he’d been working dead-end jobs for years and his frustration had mounted and mounted. He flew to Poland without telling his housemates or his parents: no one in Britain knew that he had gone. Priday felt like the man was signing his “death warrant”. (The man has subsequently returned from Ukraine.)Less than ten hours after he’d entered Ukraine, Priday left the camp and hitchhiked back to the border.

Not as crazy as it sounds, though I wouldn't give it more than 10% chance of happening. CPRF got 20% of the votes in the last, likely rigged, parliamentary elections and is trending up. Prior to the outbreak of war, an outright invasion polled at 4-8% approval - it's extremely unpopular. Western press likes to waffle about Navalny, but CPRF is the only substantial (though meek) opposition to Putin. Their true support could easily be ~35% by now. It also skews towards elderly population, with armed forces definitely nostalgic of the bygone era - i.e. generals are likely leaning more Communist than the electorate. They're also in a *it's now or never* moment

#2 - Balkanization of Eastern Ukraine

Ukraine east of Dnieper will be broken up into many small republics. There are hints of this plan in the establishment of two republics in Donbas despite them sharing a contiguous area, as well as the recent attempt to declare Kherson republic. Western Ukraine is ethnically homogeneous - they'll remain Ukraine. This scenario is actually diabolically brilliant for Russia.

Ukraine matters, for reasons I have previously stated.  Yet, the ""international order"" is not jeopardized by isolated conflicts between regional powers, even where one regional power is significantly more powerful than another.  

Russia's invading Ukraine is a regional military conflict.  Other actors may be indirectly involved to varying degrees (e.g., Belarus, for Russia; and other countries, to the extent their citizens have volunteered themselves for Ukraine's defense).  But this does not make a threat to the international order.  Putin is what he has always been, just as the international system exists in anarchy without American leadership.  To the extent there is a threat to the international order, it is the result of declining American leadership, after more than a decade of over-reach since 9/11.  

And in any case, there is no ""fortifying"" of any ""alliiance,"" whether ""democratic"" or otherwise.  Ostensibly new ideas seek to replace any pax Americana that ever may have existed; dangerous ideas that mirror the ones which impelled the world to war in the last century.  Our institutions and their integrity are the price of the ideals currently being advertised, to reset the postwar way of doing things.

[],False,,headzoo,,,[],,,,text,t2_kg68,False,True,"The other answers are probably right about seeking revenge, but it's worth noting that interest in Afghanistan by US companies increased in the 90s, and there was a push to westernize the nation. (For reasons?) Taliban leaders flew to the US quite a bit during that time to talk with leaders, educators, and politicians. There seemed to be some commotion about building oil pipelines through the country.

&gt;Central Asia is home to some of the world’s largest untapped natural resources worth trillions of dollars and, as elsewhere, they play a large role in US foreign policy in the region, particularly in Afghanistan.  
In every crisis there is an opportunity and the collapse of the Soviet Union had oil prospectors in Washington drooling with anticipation. But unlocking the oil dividend would not be without its problems.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Turkmenistan and other former Soviet states are landlocked. The easiest and cheapest pipeline would be the so-called eastern pipeline through Iran. But this is ruled out by a US embargo on trade with Tehran.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
One obvious alternative was Afghanistan. This route would allow Washington to export natural reserves to the world’s most lucrative markets, particularly Pakistan and India where demand is booming and competitors few.  
But it also promised other dividends. A trans-Afghan pipeline is more than a highway for gas and oil riches. It has been described as key component of a broader geo-strategic agenda for total military and economic control of the Middle East.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Former US National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski has described Central Asia as the “centre of world power.” National Security Council energy expert Sheila Heslin was quoted in 1997 as saying, “US policy was to promote the rapid development of Caspian energy…We did so…to in essence break Russia’s monopoly control over the transportation and oil from that region, and frankly, to promote Western energy security through diversification of supply.”  
  
&gt;  
&gt;In 1998, US Vice-President Dick Cheney, then also CEO of Halliburton oil company, said, “I cannot think of a time when we have had a region emerge as suddenly to become as strategically significant as the Caspian.”  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Afghanistan holds only limited oil and gas reserves but straddles the most direct route for exporting oil and natural gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan. Gas reserves alone in Turkmenistan’s Karakum desert holds some three trillion cubic metres, the world’s third largest, and an estimated six billion barrels of oil.

Deals to build a pipeline fell through in the late 90s because the region was still too unstable and the Taliban wasn't playing ball. (Women in the US also protested US oil companies working with the Taliban.)  
Only a year after the invasion of Afghanistan started leaders from Turkmenistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan met to work out a deal on the TAPI pipeline. Which again fell through because the country was still too unstable.  
In 2018 the president of Afghanistan, Ashraf Ghani, announced peace talks with the Taliban, and the [Taliban vowed to protect the TAPI pipeline](https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-to-protect-tapi-gas-pipeline-project/4268767.html), and a couple of years later the US announced plans to completely leave the country.",002434c8508c2e0007f3e3ea92e609e5d6c6432f,True,False,,,,,0,1647310675,,0,{},i0p6kem,False,t3_te0gm4,False,True,t3_te0gm4,/r/geopolitics/comments/te0gm4/what_is_the_realpolitik_reason_for_the_invasion/i0p6kem/,1647310686,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647281875.0,

There are a bunch of differences between America today and the USSR back then which affected the fall, but there is obviously a parallel we can see regarding worsening quality of life indicators, loss of purchasing ability, increasing income inequality and enormous defense budget. The difference between the nominal expenditure and its relative size as a percentage of the GDP is related to the size of the US economy, which is itself tied in part to the strength of the USD as the single dominant currency for international exchange. Were this to change, we'd see the proportion of defense spending as a percentage of the GDP increase. I believe that is what China and Russia are aiming for:

Just from today ""As West shuns Moscow, officials say India eyes more cheap Russian oil"" (in rubbles, that is). India is the world's third larger importer of oil so this is big news and reflects a growing tilt of Russia towards its Asian partners.

https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-considers-buying-discounted-russian-oil-commodities-officials-say-2022-03-14/

Also, defense spending itself is not enough to exercise a Pax Americana. If it were so, Latin countries' position towards the sanctions would be widespread by now, but no a single one has followed suit, not even the ones that condemned the aggression in the strongest terms.

Take a look at the comments made by the Chilean party in a mini tour that has brought an Irish envoy to Chile and Colombia, probably the two countries with traditionally the strongest ties to the US and which offered the strongest condemnation to the invasion.
