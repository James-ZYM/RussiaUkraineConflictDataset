Why even bother engaging in this sort of discussion if you are just going to dismiss the other side as 'the big bad' and refuse to even acknowledge that they have their own motivations and considerations?

You seem to prioritise virtue signalling about how bad putin is over ukrainian lives.

&gt; It increasingly appears that the longer the conflict continues, the worse things get for Russia.

OK genius. Now what do you think happens when 'things get worse for russia'?

Do they:

1. Say sorry and apologise. Note: This changes absolutely nothing but comes with colossal shame, leaves remaining existential security threats, leaves the sanctions in place etc. No leader would ever accept this, because it's worse than continuing the fight. 

2. Become increasingly desperate and start lashing out. Bombing becomes ever more indiscriminate, the risk of escalation goes through the roof, concerns about international condemnation for war crimes etc fade by the day, munitions maybe start running low so they look to their 'other' stockpiles such as novichok. Ukraine gets completely destroyed and we quite possibly end up with WW3.


Option 1 is only viable if you incentivise it somehow. They need a way to spin a failure as a victory, to at least partially roll back the sanctions, and to address at least some of the concerns that caused the conflict in the first place.

&gt; The West has been quite restrained so far in a desire to avoid escalation

what now? We have been actively encouraging our citizens to go and fight in ukraine ffs. Beyond joining the war we have been about as active as is possible, and the only reason russia hasn't considered some of the actions to amount to war is because they are pretending they're not in a war.

155,[],False,,Jack_Molesworth,,,[],,,,text,t2_epcia,False,False,"&gt;I may be mistaken, but has he explicitly said ""remove the sanctions, or I'll nuke NATO"" ?

He has not, but the suggestion of this piece - and maybe yours as well, I'm not sure? - is that maintaining sanctions at this level may push him to nuclear retaliation. To make this argument is to argue that Putin may lose his sanity.

&gt;The question is how we get Putin to *want* to end the conflict.

At some point, between sanctions at home, the apparently disastrous state of Russian military logistics to sustain operations at this scale outside of their border, and rapid attrition to Ukrainian attacks - something like 10% loss of strength in a bit over two weeks - [Russia's position may simply become untenable](https://mobile.twitter.com/general_ben/status/1503367516529250305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw). Putin will have to end the conflict because he has no choice. I think the ultimate outcome for Ukraine, Europe, and the world will be superior if Russia essentially has to withdraw without conditions, and the West doesn't demonstrate wavering resolve on the way to that conclusion.

&gt; Currently Putin's calculus is that the war is becoming increasingly existential for his regime. If the only option aside from victory is death, then I expect he will continue to escalate rather than pull back.

You advisedly say existential for his regime, and not for Russia. In truth, one could increasingly consider Putin's regime to be an existential threat to Russia. It is contrary to any Russian doctrine, and again conjecturing that Putin loses his grip on his sanity to suggest that he would escalate straight to nuclear weapons against the West, which is not involved kinetically, rather than suffer an enormous military embarrassment entirely outside of Russia's borders. This bluff should be called.

&gt;I think this underestimates both the extreme humanitarian costs for Ukraine as well as the economic damage.

I absolutely do not wish to make light of the enormous suffering on the ground, and the new horrors inflicted daily. If anything, they make me that much more intent on Russia not coming out of this with more Ukrainian territory to show for their aggression.

&gt; I could be wrong here, but let's revisit this in a few weeks after the coming ceasefire to observe what the true status is of things. 

For sure, I could be wrong. It's just my impression, based on my sources. We'll see.

&gt;This would be the end of Putin's regime, plain and simple. What motivation does he have to do this?

Possibly. He's made palace coups quite difficult, but it would certainly make his position very weak. But he can and must be brought to the point where he recognizes that attempting to continue the invasion will only make him weaker, and escalation will still not achieve his military objectives while digging an even deeper hole for himself.

&gt;The west has essentially escalated sanctions to an extreme decree, declaring in essence, economic war on the entirety fo Russia. We should anticipate a Russian response to this. 

Yes, we have, and if he didn't have nuclear weapons we'd have already bombed his invasion force to pieces and ended this. We can and should do as much as we can short of kinetic involvement. 

&gt;The rules of the international system exist to benefit the guarantors of said system (namely, the US).

This is a very cynical realist take. Liberal democracy and free trade benefit everyone who participates. There's no moral equivalence between the international system backed by the West, and the [revisionist system backed by Russia and its fellow autocracies](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/russia-ukraine-senate-testimony-autocracy-kleptocrats/627061/).

&gt;I did not see any similar calls when the USA obliterated Iraq

It's certainly legitimate to view the US invasion of Iraq as a blunder, but again there is no equivalency between what we hoped to accomplish there, and Russia's intent got Ukraine. Hussein is not Zelensky.

&gt; What the proposal is is to ensure that Russia has substantial incentives to withdraw from Ukraine and commit to the international order.

Again, the calculus here really is dependent on how you see the war progressing, but if you define ""substantial incentives"" to mean making sufficient concessions to save Putin's ego, then I say nuts to that. Eventually it will be clear that he has no choice except leave and accept defeat now, or stay and suffer more before accepting a worse defeat later. Putin has made the worst blunder of his life. For goodness sake, let's not be rushing to throw him lifelines.",334859b9cb69e5c43b95f7e04adb6113b722ac65,True,False,,,,,0,1647380164,,0,{},i0sxxz6,False,t3_ter2cy,False,True,t1_i0sp48z,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ter2cy/the_russian_sanctions_regime_and_the_risk_of/i0sxxz6/,1647380178,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647351364.0,

Yes, because you made the statement:

I then said:

&gt;I wouldn't describe George W. Bush as ""a dictator""

Because not all diplomatic acts that could, by one person or another be considered ""appeasement"" led to failure for their states.

Your views when it comes to ""appeasement"" clearly means ""an act which doesn't work out that well for America"".

""Appeasement"" worked great when Britain ditched the anglo-japanese alliance, appeasement worked wonders when Churchill appeased Roosevelt at Placentia Bay, appeasement was great when Truman handed over Eastern Europe to Stalin at Yalta, appeasement was fantastic when Yeltsin did nothing in the face of NATO expansionism.

I'll try to illustrate my reasoning.

We well know these countries know the pain of being under the Soviet/Russian thumb. They fear Russian expansion now more than ever. Expansion even outside their borders is concerning to them.

While NATO and EU membership both offer defensive clauses, membership couldn't happen in the immediate or near future without bending qualification rules and being something Russia wants to avoid at high costs. An end to current military actions might leave an explotable window for a round 3 from Russia in Ukraine.

These leaders could hold talks with Ukraine without being in-person or on NATO territory. Instead they are showing they, even personally, are willing to risk their lives in the face of Russian invasion. Why go to those lengths except to show they stand by Ukraine in a way no one else has? 

We know there are ongoing talks between Ukraine and Russia with rumors they are getting closer. We know Ukraine has made notions about abandoning NATO pursuit in the near future and can assume they don't want a round 3. With EU membership looking like it's out of the cards for a decade plus to realistically hit reforms and NATO being a Russian hard-line, what guarantee could be find against a potential round 3?

Ex-Warsaw pact members have more reason than any other to step in to that void. Seeing Russia flounder to this degree likely plays into this calculus. Together it would appear Russia couldn't hope to truly succeed even without direct EU or NATO involvement.

Whether this pans out in reality, who knows. Depends on many unknowns as of yet. The reasoning is there and the overt demonstration of sheer balls and will is also there.

230,[],False,,evo_help93,,,[],,,,text,t2_iul8dbh4,False,False,"&gt;I'm not saying he is insane, but the conjecture that he might escalate to the use of nuclear weapons because of sanctions describes an insane person.

My understanding is that Putin has merely put Russia's strategic arsenal on high alert (likely to reinforce the current deterrence posture). I may be mistaken, but has he explicitly said ""remove the sanctions, or I'll nuke NATO"" ?

&gt;This happens literally as soon as Putin wants it to.

We are in agreement here. The question is how we get Putin to *want* to end the conflict. Currently Putin's calculus is that the war is becoming increasingly existential for his regime. If the only option aside from victory is death, then I expect he will continue to escalate rather than pull back. We should be building the appropriate conditions to minimize the risk of escalation. 

&gt;It increasingly appears that the longer the conflict continues, the worse things get for Russia. Their bargaining position weakens daily, and although Ukraine is motivated to avoid further attacks on civilians and cities the military outlook moves increasingly in their favor with the passage of time. Kyiv will not fall - it probably won't even be encircled.

I think this underestimates both the extreme humanitarian costs for Ukraine as well as the economic damage. I've spent a considerable amount of time in post-conflict countries. Those scars run extremely deep and Ukraine is not going to recover to it's (already less than stellar) pre-war standard of living for *quite some time.* 

In addition, the fog of war is thick and I have yet to see compelling evidence that Ukraine is going to ""win"" in a military sense. We have very little knowledge of the current status of Ukraine's armed forces. Russia took a bad mauling, yes, but continues to be able to inflict disproportionate amounts of pain on Ukraine. I could be wrong here, but let's revisit this in a few weeks after the coming ceasefire to observe what the true status is of things. 

&gt;It would be easy for Russia to enable removal of sanctions: end the war, and give up all claims to territory within the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine. Pay reparations out of unfrozen assets. The fact that Putin's ego won't allow him to do so is simply a reason to continue to apply sanctions until he does.

This would be the end of Putin's regime, plain and simple. What motivation does he have to do this?

&gt;The West has been quite restrained so far in a desire to avoid escalation, thus limiting lethal aid to defensive systems only. With this action Russia has declared itself a rogue nation whose word isn't worth spit.

The west has essentially escalated sanctions to an extreme decree, declaring in essence, economic war on the entirety fo Russia. We should anticipate a Russian response to this. 

&gt;They should be removed from the international system until they demonstrate that they are willing to play by its most basic rules

The rules of the international system exist to benefit the guarantors of said system (namely, the US). I did not see any similar calls when the USA obliterated Iraq (this is actually one of Russia's major complaints about said system, but I digress). In any event, the key here is that Russia should be brought back *into* the international system in a way that assures their buy-in to the system. This has been a difficult maneuver since the end of the cold-war but I would argue the west blundered here and set Russia / Ukraine and NATO on a collision course as far back as 2014.

&gt; Any ""peace"" that rewards Russia in the slightest way for this atrocity should be rejected.

This is... frankly not how negotiation work. I understand the moral imperative at play here, but sometimes you do have to pay the hostage taker to save the hostage. But please, let me be clear. No one is talking about ""rewarding"" Russia for invading Ukraine. What the proposal is is to ensure that Russia has substantial incentives to withdraw from Ukraine and commit to the international order. Russia should be a significant cost for the invasion to deter future aggression, but they also should achieve some sort of satisfying outcome through an international framework. 

&gt; Literally the only thing Putin has over the West is his willingness to engage in nuclear brinksmanship.

This is simply incorrect. If a group of criminal hackers can take down the largest pipeline in the USA for a week, I assume the Russian state likely has cyber capabilities that can do more. They can engage in far more aggressive weapons exports to their networks across the middle east. Hell, what's to stop them now from exporting ICBM technology to North Korea or Iran? Or to reneg on nuclear non-proliferation? Or to further interfere in elections throughout North America / Europe? Russia has meaningful ways to impose costs on the West. Currently we are in the process of removing any blockers from them doing so.

&gt; Ending the human suffering in Ukraine

This happens literally as soon as Putin wants it to. 

&gt; This conflict will end with a diplomatic settlement given neither party is unlikely to collapse completely. Therefore the longer the conflict continues, the worse things are going to be for Ukraine, Russia, and the world.

It increasingly appears that the longer the conflict continues, the worse things get for Russia. Their bargaining position weakens daily, and although Ukraine is motivated to avoid further attacks on civilians and cities the military outlook moves increasingly in their favor with the passage of time.

&gt; These sanctions, basically an 11 out of 10 in terms of severity, are being imposed pretty much exclusively as ""punishment"" so there's very little reason for the Russians to believe that anything they could do would remove the sanctions. 

It would be easy for Russia to enable removal of sanctions: end the war, and give up all claims to territory within the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine. Pay reparations out of unfrozen assets. The fact that Putin's ego won't allow him to do so is simply a reason to continue to apply sanctions until he does.

The West has been quite restrained so far in a desire to avoid escalation, thus limiting lethal aid to defensive systems only. With this action Russia has declared itself a rogue nation whose word isn't worth spit. They *should* be removed from the international system until they demonstrate that they are willing to play by its most basic rules. Any ""peace"" that rewards Russia in the slightest way for this atrocity should be rejected. Literally the only thing Putin has over the West is his willingness to engage in nuclear brinksmanship.

I also figured the US had more soft targets that could be hit as well, given the often low priority of IT security in the US for-profit corporate world.  I would have also figured a lot of the high value Russian cyberwarfare targets were perhaps older, less well connected/computerized in ways that made them less vulnerable to cyberwarfare.

Then there's the idea that the Russians have had years of probing/mining the US weak IT security landscape, perhaps in collaboration with cybercrime rings which are always said to operate with the ""cooperation"" of the state intelligence services.

The probability of Putin having ""gone insane"" is remarkably low. Truman and Khrushchev both engaged in multiple episodes of ""nuclear blackmail"" and neither were ""insane."" But this is rapidly becoming an existential conflict for Putin and his regime. When leaders think of things in existential terms, risk escalates and the likelihood of escalation grows exponentially. There is a dynamic going on where public outrage against Russia is driving an extreme escalation in sanctions / assistance that is very risky (see: calls for a no-fly zone, MIGs to Ukraine, etc.)

Why do we want off-ramps for the Kremlin? A few reasons:

1. Ending the human suffering in Ukraine
2. This conflict will end with a diplomatic settlement given neither party is unlikely to collapse completely. Therefore the longer the conflict continues, the worse things are going to be for Ukraine, Russia, and the world. 
3. Pullback from the escalation spiral we are approaching. Russia will likely retaliate for sanctions (non-kinetically, likely through cyber), and it's difficult to see how Western officials won't climb the escalation ladder and then we end up in a tit-for-tat escalatory spiral
4. Russia has basically no stake in Western economies or, increasingly, in the global economy and therefore doing damage to one or both is now *far* less costly than it was three weeks ago.

This was to put a damper on the influx of foreign fighters into Ukraine.

Military assets in a country you are at war with are viable targets. I don't understand how this is ""escalation"" against NATO. If anything the massive deliveries of NATO weaponry to Ukraine are part of what sparked this current crisis.

I know this will be an unpopular take, but I don't see how Russia refusing to engage with military bases in Ukraine because they're near the border, or refusing to target military aid convoys (once they enter Ukraine) because they have a NATO postage stamp on them, or stopping an ongoing military op because some foreign dignitaries decided to step right into the middle of it is ""russian escalation.""",9bc254d8c0995dba07887348c949e1f75e2a244f,True,False,,,,,0,1647374199,,0,{},i0sie9p,False,t3_tensbz,False,True,t1_i0shlqe,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tensbz/ukraine_megathread_march_15/i0sie9p/,1647374211,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647345399.0,

In most conflicts this tends to harden the resolve of defenders, not break it. The USSR suffered extraordinarily during WWII but kept fighting on because of how terrible Nazi Germany was. This war is being perceived as Ukraine's own ""Great Patriotic War"" and a war of independence from Russia among the populace and the more terrible things the Russians do the more driven the defenders will become. 

&gt;They may simply choose to pound what they can, as often as they can, while trying to pressure Kyiv into a settlement.

For how long though? Even if the Russians decide to just shell every city into oblivion their losses are adding up and the costs in men and materiel are considerable. Will the Russian people accept the Russian armed forces turning *Russian-majority* cities across the East into smoking craters as part of their ""war of liberation"" for Ukraine indefinitely, even as sanctions send them into a second great depression? I'm skeptical. 

&gt;Russia definitely doesn’t have the manpower or the resources to capture major cities, but I’m not convinced that’s their intention (any more). They’re just going to wreak havoc and cause as much carnage as they can until Zelensky relents.

If it's bordering on propaganda then don't post it, take it to LessCredibleDefense.  

Why won't they go on the offensive?  1) because the Russian Army is a mess but not beaten, and still has aggressively large formations of arty, plus a still functional Airforce, even if hamstrung by UA AA.  They don't have the logistics to advance, but defending is a different story.  Now it's the Ukrainians who have to advance up a handful of roads or else get stuck in the mud, etc.  

Right now the UA can stay defensive and bleed the Russians, but concentrating enough forces to launch anything but a local counterattack is going to draw a lot of massed fires from Russia.  It is unlikely the UA has enough force-multipliers on the ground to seriously overcome Russians, though, again, localized counterattacks are a different story.  A large-scale UA offensive would drain them, and Russia has more capacity to re-arm and attack again than the UA Army does.   

&gt; The current assumption is that Ukraine may be fully liberated from the Russians, why not Belarus as well?

No one is making that assumption that will happen outside of propaganda.  The Russians will likely hold the territory they've captured in the east.  Hell, the Russians invading up to the Dniper river and holding everything east of that was considered a possible outcome before shooting even started.  Sanctions and the poor state of the army will probably force the Russians to the table, maybe, but the idea that they'll just walk away from Crimea or Donbas is unrealistic.  

Belarus is looking fragile and unmotivated -- makes me think of WARPACT members not being crazy about being in the PACT, e.g. the Czeckoslovaks -- but the idea that there will be a serious push into Belarus is laughable; they're not even in the war yet, and it's debatable as to if the UA has the resources to even launch a large-scale attack domestically.  

&gt; The Russian military has shown to be useless besides indiscriminate air strikes and artillery

That's how they won WW2, Georgia, Crimea, and 2 wars in Chechnya.  Killing civilians only matters if you care about those things.  Not like it's the first time Moscow tried to cleanse the Ukrainians, either. 
 

&gt; Would the Russians be able to stop semi-guerilla light infantry offensives into Belarus territory? Or would the react with tactical nukes?

Neither of these is a realistic play; Belarus still ain't in the war, and even if it is, the UA doesn't have the resources to do offensives; if they did, why invade Belarus when they need to be relieving encircled units in Ukraine proper?  

Tactical nukes are not an option; that's basically WW3 at that point.",9da6cf1c36e5209a87e1a73d4de31287e5b9b6b4,True,False,,,,,0,1647370215,,0,{},i0s843l,False,t3_tdxg6p,False,False,t1_i0nm7er,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tdxg6p/ukraine_megathread_march_14/i0s843l/,1647370235,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647341415.0,

&gt; Lieutenant Colonel Alex Vershinin retired after twenty years of service, including eight years as an armor officer with four combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and twelve years working as a modeling and simulations officer in NATO and US Army concept development and experimentation. This included a tour with the US Army Sustainment Battle Lab, where he led the experimentation scenario team.

He also wrote a widely shared article about Russian logistics back in November. Hard to believe we have been talking about this stuff since November.

Bump up the threshold to 6 or 7 dollars a day, and consider that many people have since fallen back into extreme poverty due to the economic shock caused by COVID, and at least a billion Chinese are earning just a few dollars a day.

I agree with most of what you said about Taiwan. But consider that this diplomatic, economic and cultural pressure is merely the use of soft power, and China can't take this very far. The Chinese can pressure or threaten Taiwan all it wants, but meanwhile the US can sail a warship through the Taiwan Strait, the island can host US troops, the Taiwanese can conduct joint military exercises with the Japanese, and Taiwan can buy military equipment from the Americans. These are true expressions of power, and there is nothing China can do about it.

Taiwan is an island, and a heavily fortified one that is mountainous. China would need to conduct an amphibious assault if it were to invade. China doesn't have any experience with amphibious warfare. And even if it did, it wouldn't have the capability to pull it off. The Taiwanese air force would be able to easily cut the Chinese supply line to the island, and destroy any forces before they even had a chance to land and disperse on the island.",c13744982972c98267fc00e4711f04591b9260dc,True,False,,,,,0,1647369217,,0,{},i0s5jta,False,t3_te4kpe,False,True,t1_i0qfk4j,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/te4kpe/how_was_ukraine_able_to_conceal_its_true/i0s5jta/,1647369232,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647340417.0,

Cuz that's what they've got, and they're effective.  Doubly so for ground missions.  

See how old the B-52 or A-10 airframes are...


&gt; Why are they operating within range of manpads when they’ve lost so many fighters already? 

They've expended, or don't have, the ability to do large-scale precision bombing from high altitude.  There were a lot of missile and air strikes in the beginning, so it's possible they've burned through many / most / all of their PGMs, or have lost aircraft with the ability to utilize them.  

Or they still have a stockpile but are saving them for high value targets.  They may not also be able to identify or track targets. [Johnnie Cochran voice] *a JDAM ain't shit if you don't know what to hit. *

So unguided bombing necessitates lower altitudes.  The A-10 has PGM capabilities but if it wants to drop dumb bombs or BRRRRRRRRTTTT then it's gotta go lower, too.  Difference is that the UA has a semi-functional AA grid and MANPADs


&gt; Where are their air dominance fighters like Su35s and strategic bombers like Tu140s? Are they not using them or do we simply not have videos yet?

No fat slow bombers because 1) they're big, slow, and easy to see, and quite vulnerable to things like Buk-2s / 9М38s or the like; 2) because of the above question about Su25s: no PGMs, so gotta go low; and 3) no real reason to break out the super-sonic Strategic Bombers, since they're expensive to operate and there aren't any carriers to sink or nukes to drop.  I'm sure they are probably in use to some degree, but every hour of flight time translates to hours of maintenance, and throwing 1000 kg bombs at a UA platoon isn't their main raison d'être.

Same sotry with high speed interceptors and air superiority fighters -- most real air resistance has been neutralized, so everything outside of a basic CAP and anti-drone efforts is burning up fuel and using parts -- and, given the operational tempo, it's likely that it's fuel and parts they don't have.",3b0ca00d586a4e62aafa3337f471e58690187601,True,False,,,,,0,1647367706,,0,{},i0s1nbr,False,t3_tdxg6p,False,True,t1_i0pt3d4,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tdxg6p/ukraine_megathread_march_14/i0s1nbr/,1647367720,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647338906.0,

First off, a major newspaper(I believe it was the New York Times) has confirmed that the airborne troops were driven into the woods by a Ukrainian counterattack, citing soldiers who participated in the counterattack.

A major newspaper also assured us that the ANA would hold out for months, and that ISIL's leader was killed a dozen times before he was, and that Kim Jong Un was dead and replaced with a body double. ""A newspaper said so"" should never be taken as proof. It shouldn't even be taken as encouragement - the news business depends on attention and everything it reports is calculated to maximize clicks.

&gt; Furthermore, this fits with our knowledge that the northern armor column was delayed in arriving to the airfield and historical examples of what happens to airborne troops given insufficient support.

You don't think the fact that they were driving through an abandoned, irradiated swamp with one highway had anything to do with it?

&gt; Even if the airport was held, the operation was a strategic failure as the IL-76s intended to land at the airport and deliver heavier troops were never able to do so, preventing the planned decapitation strike from succeeding.

How do we know IL-76s intended to deliver ""heavier troops""?

&gt; Even if the VDV managed to hold the airport, they were unable to access the strategic benefits of doing so, making the operation a failure.

Distracting the Ukrainians from attacking the main Russian force as it advanced through the Pripyat Marshes is a great strategic success. Attacking through such inhospitable terrain is not possible if the enemy is prepared.

This is a weird take. First off, a major newspaper(I believe it was the New York Times) has confirmed that the airborne troops were driven into the woods by a Ukrainian counterattack, citing soldiers who participated in the counterattack. Furthermore, this fits with our knowledge that the northern armor column was delayed in arriving to the airfield and historical examples of what happens to airborne troops given insufficient support. Even if the airport was held, the operation was a strategic failure as the IL-76s intended to land at the airport and deliver heavier troops were never able to do so, preventing the planned decapitation strike from succeeding. Even if the VDV managed to hold the airport, they were unable to access the strategic benefits of doing so, making the operation a failure.

Also, your source for ""infighting within the Kremlin"" doesn't claim that at all, from my reading. It seems to be a fairly uncontroversial summary of the events so far, and, if anything, praises the FSB, stating:

&gt;“The information is very good,” said Nick Reynolds, a research analyst for land warfare at RUSI and one of the co-authors of the report on the [FSB's] public opinion surveys. ""The way they’ve utilized it has been suboptimal.”

&gt; The logic of deterrence – in particular the fact that it is both very high stakes and also based entirely on perception – explains why NATO and especially the United States took any direct military action off of the table quite loudly well before the conflict began. Saying that ‘all options are on the table’ – as the United States routinely does with Taiwan – would have been a fairly obvious bluff. When Putin called that obvious bluff, it would have damaged the credibility and thus the deterrence value of that same statement when applied to NATO members or Taiwan, weakening the effect of US deterrence, and thus potentially encouraging another state (like China) to try to call an American bluff elsewhere (essentially inviting a piecemeal maneuver). And of course the danger to that is two-fold: on the one hand if the United States and NATO folds, it calls into question even more of its security arrangements, but if it doesn’t fold, the result is likely to be a major war which in turn could (and frankly probably would) lead to an escalatory spiral ending in the use of nuclear weapons.

It doesn't mean level the entire city, it means an artillery-centric advance where infantry acts as a reconnaissance in force asset. This was at least the theory of Putin's strategy in the Second Chechen War, but it was badly practiced and effectively became ""level everything"". Today's Russian army, though still wildly deficient in many areas, has shown itself to be better at employing artillery than before. A great deal of this has to do with vastly better ""eyes"" - Russian artillery has a swarm of small drones scanning the battlefield - but it's also an element of the kind of artillery Russia is now employing. It has the most self-propelled artillery in the world, and these guns are able to rapidly reposition to support an infantry advance or even become ""first responders"" to firefights outside their immediate range.

Tunnels are of course a variable in urban warfare, but wouldn't change much as far as the use of artillery is concerned. You can use tunnels to transport troops, but the key danger in urban warfare comes from rooftops. This is especially the case for the Russians, whose tanks tend to have lower gun elevations than their Western equivalents and who have a learned ""fear of heights"" as a result. Leveling these heights is therefore still effective for the Russians.

592,[],False,,Zhuregin,,,[],,,,text,t2_jzs2u5qq,False,False,"Virtually everything about this article is wrong and betrays a lack of understanding of how the Russian military operates. First, there is no ""Gerasimov doctrine"" and no one man was responsible for the post-2000 doctrinal changes in the Russian army. All doctrinal questions in the VRF are determined by a dedicated branch, the General Staff (""GenShtab"") which bases them off historical study, with WW2 being their main case study. Incidentally this is why Soviet-Russian doctrine gets more and more obsolete over the decades: WW2's relevance to modern warfare is decreasing by the year. 

Second, what we call the ""Gerasimov doctrine"" is just a few comments Gerasmov made on the intersection of politics, espionage, and warfare. The simplest way to define a doctrine is just a ""theory of victory"", and those comments are not that. They are just him spitballing about ways to handle very specific political situations.

Third, there is no evidence the attack on Hostomel failed. There is video of the airport falling, but not of it being retaken. The only proof of its recapture is [this picture](https://preview.redd.it/xspdoitwxuj81.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fed37ae3734b4fb5e0eee7a90101079111b12e7e). The airport remains in Russian hands today. This is a particularly dangerous piece of fake news to come out of this conflict because pundits have used it to attack the airborne MOS in general. The attack should be seen as an endorsement of modern airborne ops, having succeeded even in contested airspace, not a sign of their obsolescence.
 
Fourth, the guy's chronology of the war is not quite correct. True, Gerasimov and his de jure boss Shoigu preferred a firepower-centric doctrine, but that is not the doctrine that Russia opened the war with. FSB assured Putin that Ukrainian resistance would be weak (there is zero evidence Gerasimov &amp; Shoigu agreed - this is why some FSB officials have been fired but Gerasimov, Shoigu, and their staffs have all kept their jobs and actually appear to be in good spirits). Consequently Russia decided to do ""thunder runs"" all over Ukraine with no fire support. What the author is describing - the atrocious, Grozny-style shelling of cities - happened only after Shoigu and Gerasimov regained control of the war, ordered a ""tactical pause"" to bring up the artillery then proceeded to fight ""their way"".

Russian decision making was certainly flawed in this crisis but all evidence points to Gerasimov being on the ""right"" side of the dispute. There are a lot of reports that the invasion plan and the FSB purges afterwards were a result of [infighting within the Kremlin](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-invasion-ukraine-intelligence-putin/31748594.html). For ten years, there has been bureaucratic competition between the FSB and the military, which operates its own parallel intelligence agency, the GRU. Ever since 2016, GRU and not FSB has been the main driver of Russian intelligence operations. This factional battle intensified after COVID, at which point [Putin isolated himself from all but a dozen people](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-10549359/Vladimir-Putin-isnt-mad-hes-evil-writes-Russian-Presidents-biographer-Professor-MARK-GALEOTTI.html) to avoid the virus. GRU and FSB were his only ""eyes"". FSB made a wildly inaccurate assessment of the strength of Ukrainian resistance, and consequently was [purged](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russian-spy-chiefs-putin-security-b2034350.html) after the initial setbacks while Gerasimov is getting on just fine.",90771773ddb28320d287ca923d4303799c16d533,True,False,,,,,0,1647361889,,0,{},i0rmlez,False,t3_terqcb,False,True,t3_terqcb,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/terqcb/general_valery_gerasimovs_great_ukrainian/i0rmlez/,1647361903,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647333089.0,

I am complete layman, but given that the Grozny approach worked for Russia in the past, I can at least foresee that the same approach will be tried again. At the height of the shelling, Grozny was taking 30000 shells per day, according to the podcast. Can Russia sustain such a shelling again on Kyiv? I honestly have no clue.

But then, and I think this is the key insight from the podcast, the rubbled city of Kyiv is going to be much harder to take than Grozny. More fighters will survive in the underground system (unless Russia clears the underground system with thermobaric/chemical weapons? That would take out a crazy number of civilians though). As the podcast lays out in much detail, completely isolating Kyiv will be very hard with the amount of Russian troops dedicated to taking the city now, so supplies will keep coming in to a limited extent. There is now also a sizable amount of sophisticated ATGMs and MANPADs in play, which makes tanks/aircraft that much more vulnerable. As the podcaster points out, tanks are (at least historically) essential in urban warfare to shield from bullets and punch through concrete.

I can see the podcast being right, that the battle of Kyiv will be more like a modern day Stalingrad rather than a new Grozny.

Absolutely. To wit:

They already had one of those, in the form of a non-aggression pact to which Russia was a party.  It promised that Ukraine's sovereignty and borders would be respected.

If another bit of paper is signed by another set of dignitaries, Russia will go home, lick its wounds for 8 or 10 years, rebuild, wait for the US and EU to become more divided, helped along by their agitprop sowing more divisiveness in the west, and try again. Would they do better? Who knows. There are many lessons I'm sure they are learning from the current attempt.

There must be some mechanism to deter that outcome, possibly with sanctions, although one has to provide a carrot as well as a stick. Rewards for good behavior seem advisable. For example, if Russia evicts Putin, institutes free and fair elections free of coercion and overseen by international monitors, and starts behaving as a responsible member of the international community, the west should be prepared to reward that.",ab23a753a9bbcb375dc1c20e6764f610868bb98f,True,False,,,,,0,1647360673,,0,{},i0rjfqd,False,t3_tensbz,False,True,t1_i0r2yhg,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tensbz/ukraine_megathread_march_15/i0rjfqd/,1647360686,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647331873.0,

That makes it a more responsible way to think about nuclear policy.

If you have a view that full-scale nuclear war is a civilization-ending, even species-ending event, and that no other views are worth considering, then nuclear policy becomes trivial: as long as no actors are actively suicidal, every possible path through every party's use/no-use decision tree leads to ""don't launch the missiles, and do everything in your power to make sure nobody else does"". A responsible nuclear policy is based around making sure no apocalyptic death cults get their hands on a major nuclear arsenal... and that's it. Nothing else is necessary, because apocalyptic death cults are a necessary ingredient in nuclear war.

But if you allow for some actors in the system to have the view that full-scale nuclear war is not only survivable but winnable, suddenly things get much more complex, because some paths through the global decision tree now lead to ""launch the missiles"" or ""encourage someone else to launch the missiles"". You don't have to personally have this view, but you do have to account for others having this view. And *that* means that you can take actions meant to discourage other parties from going down those dangerous paths of the decision tree.

This is the wikipedia entry for the doctrine the author is writing about in the article:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerasimov_doctrine

For nearly a decade we have been hearing about this magical doctrine and how effective and smart it is. But it has always rubbed me the wrong way, because it is essentially a guide to acting like an SOB and then declaring yourself a genius. 

It reminds me of playing board games with friends in my youth. There were people who thought that betrayals and cheating to win were genius moves. The problem is that they only work once, after that and your opponents know exactly what you are and block any future success. 

This is essentially the situation that Russia is in right now. They tried to replicate the success that they had in 2014, that were successful because it was so outside the accepted norms of civilized behavior. Then when they tried to do it again in February it failed because it was obvious what they were up to this time. Excuse me if I do enjoy seeing these so called 'doctrines' of vicious duplicity being exposed as justifications of scoundrels who are militarily incompetent.",aa6b655d0ed88c8b7dc324dfc67bb6491aed69b9,True,False,,,,,0,1647359290,,0,{},i0rfvor,True,t3_terqcb,False,True,t3_terqcb,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/terqcb/general_valery_gerasimovs_great_ukrainian/i0rfvor/,1647359305,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647330490.0,

It's less expensive, creates far fewer obligations to the families of spies and other assets, it's less dangerous, and...

There's a hostility to active measures overseas by a large portion of the American public due to the absolute horror show that was Iran and Latin America that US intelligence was involved in during the cold war.

The thinking was, if the CIA doesn't have the capacity to create blowback, blowback won't happen.

This article is an interesting take on the effect of sanctions. I found it to be thought provoking and the first paragraph was fascinating:

&gt; In August 1941, excrement was piling up in Tokyo, literally. Most of the city lacked a sewer system, and human waste had to be regularly trucked away from homes. In late July, the United States had frozen Japanese assets and embargoed oil sales to Japan to oppose the Japanese war in China. There was no longer enough fuel for the motor vehicles that normally transported the sewage out of the city, and bicycle-drawn carts could not keep up with demand. Residents complained loudly. The American sanctions created more than just sewage problems, and Japanese leaders came to believe they would lose power if they did nothing. They also believed they would lose power if they abandoned the war in China. As a result, Tokyo expanded the war and attacked Pearl Harbor. Critically, the Japanese cabinet chose to attack the United States even after it received analysis which reached the “unequivocal conclusion” that war with the United States “was unwinnable.”",f12680a5a2fef68f635c467e0ab214e393003ac7,True,False,,,,,0,1647356863,,0,{},i0r9t48,True,t3_ter2cy,False,True,t3_ter2cy,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ter2cy/the_russian_sanctions_regime_and_the_risk_of/i0r9t48/,1647356889,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647328063.0,

I believe you, but the question is absurd. Trump was friendlier to Russia, and thus not a threat, especially as his presidency allowed a Russian influence operation to divide Americans internally.

The point of preferring Trump to Clinton is that Clinton is a Liberal internationalist who sees spreading democracy as a moral good, and thus would be inclined to support Ukraine and democratic movements in Belarus and Russia proper. 

But the primary goal was to make America's democratic processes seem illegitimate in the eyes of supporters of both political parties. That's the Russian Hacking as well as Stop the Steal. Both were influence operations, and Trump went along with both because he doesn't particularly care about anything that doesn't benefit him personally.

Biden is a much stronger president in terms of foreign policy and rebuilding things like infrastructure. One of the reasons for the price of oil going skyward is that Biden has gotten a lot of people back to work and created the best market for labor I've seen in my lifetime.

The great resignation has led to the best labor market for workers since the 1970s, and if you're not finding the highest rung you can grab on a career ladder right now while employers are desperate for people... what the actual fuck are you doing?

Millennials and Gen Z folks are finding themselves with actual career path jobs for the first time in their lives.

So Biden's strengthening American alliances like NATO, strengthening the economic position of workers who are the foundation of the American economy, and doing a lot that will help the US nationally and internationally in the long run.

But yeah, Putin is invading because Biden is in office. Putin decided to invade when he was likely to still have a chance of success. After four years of American training and supply to Ukraine, fortress Ukraine may have been unassailable. 

So he went in when he was likely to have a greater chance of success than he would in the future given Biden's position as another Liberal Internationalist who believes in spreading democracy by supporting organic internal democratic and liberal movements in developing countries.

And while that's not an existential threat to *Russia*, it *is* an existential threat to the Putin regime. 

So your reasoning that it's Biden isn't wrong. But the idea that it's because Biden is weak, rather than Trump (who was weakening America by weakening its key security alliance) was friendly, and Biden is not.

There's this conspiracy theory floating around that the State Department is going around creating color revolutions and causing internal coups in authoritarian regimes.

And that's absurd. The CIA has absolutely collapsed in terms of HUMINT and is just a SIGINT analysis group right now. They don't have the capacity to pull something like that off.

But in my view, they really ought to have that capacity.

So in light of Russian aggression and interference in our democracy we should rebuild the CIA's HUMINT capabilities, give them the capacity to actually carry out color revolutions, and then carry the American revolution forward to every Tinpot dictatorship the world over.

Democratize and decolonize the planet, I say, so that wars like this can never happen again, and borders will move if they need to via the ballot box, rather than with bombs and bullets.

Russia Deploys a Mystery Munition in Ukraine  
Iskander-M short-range ballistic missiles are releasing a previously unknown decoy designed to evade air-defense systems, an American official said.

American intelligence officials have discovered that the barrage of ballistic missiles Russia has fired into Ukraine contain a surprise: decoys that trick air-defense radars and fool heat-seeking missiles.  
  
The devices are each about a foot long, shaped like a dart and white with an orange tail, according to an American intelligence official. They are released by the Iskander-M short-range ballistic missiles that Russia is firing from mobile launchers across the border, the official said, when the missile senses that it has been targeted by air defense systems.

Each is packed with electronics and produces radio signals to jam or spoof enemy radars attempting to locate the Iskander-M, and contains a heat source to attract incoming missiles. The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about intelligence matters, described the devices on the condition of anonymity.  
  
The use of the decoys may help explain why Ukrainian air-defense weapons have had difficulty intercepting Russia’s Iskander missiles.

Powered by a solid-fuel rocket motor, the Iskander can reach targets more than 200 miles away, according to U.S. government documents. Each mobile launcher can fire two Iskanders before it must be reloaded.  
  
Photographs of the dart-shaped munitions began circulating on social media two weeks ago. They had stumped experts and open-source intelligence analysts — many of whom mistook them for bomblets from cluster weapons based on their size and shape.

Richard Stevens, who spent 22 years in the British Army as an explosive ordnance disposal soldier, and later worked as a civilian bomb technician for 10 years in southern Iraq, Africa and other regions, said he had been exposed “to plenty of Chinese and Russian munitions, but I had never seen this.”  
  
Mr. Stevens posted photos of the munitions to a site for military and civilian bomb disposal experts that he started in 2011, and found that no one else seemed to have seen these mystery munitions before either.

“That Russia is using that size of weapon — the Iskander-M — and quite a few of them I believe, that’s why we’re seeing this now,” Mr. Stevens added. “It’s just that, post-conflict in the past 10 to 15 years, no one has had the opportunity to see this.”

The devices are similar to Cold War decoys called “penetration aids,” the intelligence official said, that have accompanied nuclear warheads since the 1970s and were designed to evade antimissile systems and allow individual warheads to reach their targets. The incorporation of the devices into weapons like the Iskander-M that have conventional warheads has not been previously documented in military arsenals.

“The minute people came up with missiles, people started trying to shoot them down, and the minute people started trying to shoot them down, people started thinking about penetration aids,” Jeffrey Lewis, a professor of nonproliferation at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, Calif., said in an interview. “But we never see them because they’re highly secret — if you know how they work, you can counteract them.”

The use of the decoys may point to some level of carelessness or urgency by Russian military leadership, Mr. Lewis said, given that Russia knows they will inevitably be collected and studied by Western intelligence services so that NATO air defenses can be programmed to defeat the Iskander’s countermeasures.

And it is highly unlikely, he said, that the version of the Iskander that Russia has sold to other countries would contain these decoys.  
  
“That suggests to me that the Russians place some value on keeping that technology close to home and that this war is important enough to them to give that up,” Mr. Lewis said. “They’re digging deep, and maybe they no longer care, but I would care if I were them.”

**Russia Deploys a Mystery Munition in Ukraine**

Iskander-M short-range ballistic missiles are releasing a previously unknown decoy designed to evade air-defense systems, an American official said.

American intelligence officials have discovered that the barrage of ballistic missiles Russia has fired into Ukraine contain a surprise: decoys that trick air-defense radars and fool heat-seeking missiles.

The devices are each about a foot long, shaped like a dart and white with an orange tail, according to an American intelligence official. They are released by the Iskander-M short-range ballistic missiles that Russia is firing from mobile launchers across the border, the official said, when the missile senses that it has been targeted by air defense systems.

Each is packed with electronics and produces radio signals to jam or spoof enemy radars attempting to locate the Iskander-M, and contains a heat source to attract incoming missiles. The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about intelligence matters, described the devices on the condition of anonymity.

The use of the decoys may help explain why Ukrainian air-defense weapons have had difficulty intercepting Russia’s Iskander missiles.

Powered by a solid-fuel rocket motor, the Iskander can reach targets more than 200 miles away, according to U.S. government documents. Each mobile launcher can fire two Iskanders before it must be reloaded.

Photographs of the dart-shaped munitions began circulating on social media two weeks ago. They had stumped experts and open-source intelligence analysts — many of whom mistook them for bomblets from cluster weapons based on their size and shape.

Richard Stevens, who spent 22 years in the British Army as an explosive ordnance disposal soldier, and later worked as a civilian bomb technician for 10 years in southern Iraq, Africa and other regions, said he had been exposed “to plenty of Chinese and Russian munitions, but I had never seen this.”

Mr. Stevens posted photos of the munitions to a site for military and civilian bomb disposal experts that he started in 2011, and found that no one else seemed to have seen these mystery munitions before either.

“That Russia is using that size of weapon — the Iskander-M — and quite a few of them I believe, that’s why we’re seeing this now,” Mr. Stevens added. “It’s just that, post-conflict in the past 10 to 15 years, no one has had the opportunity to see this.”

The devices are similar to Cold War decoys called “penetration aids,” the intelligence official said, that have accompanied nuclear warheads since the 1970s and were designed to evade antimissile systems and allow individual warheads to reach their targets. The incorporation of the devices into weapons like the Iskander-M that have conventional warheads has not been previously documented in military arsenals.

“The minute people came up with missiles, people started trying to shoot them down, and the minute people started trying to shoot them down, people started thinking about penetration aids,” Jeffrey Lewis, a professor of nonproliferation at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, Calif., said in an interview. “But we never see them because they’re highly secret — if you know how they work, you can counteract them.”

The use of the decoys may point to some level of carelessness or urgency by Russian military leadership, Mr. Lewis said, given that Russia knows they will inevitably be collected and studied by Western intelligence services so that NATO air defenses can be programmed to defeat the Iskander’s countermeasures.

And it is highly unlikely, he said, that the version of the Iskander that Russia has sold to other countries would contain these decoys.

“That suggests to me that the Russians place some value on keeping that technology close to home and that this war is important enough to them to give that up,” Mr. Lewis said. “They’re digging deep, and maybe they no longer care, but I would care if I were them.”

“I think that there are some very excited people in the U.S. intelligence community right now,” he added.

However, I've seen a lot of comments suggesting Ukraine's best option is a negotiated settlement that effectively cedes Crimea and the separatist territories to Russia. The only way that actually results in peace is if Ukraine is able to join NATO or an equivalent defensive pact afterwards. Anything short of that is appeasement, plain and simple.

Russia has proven themselves to be a bad faith actor who's goals do not reflect any sort of real recognition of Ukrainian sovereignty. Even a weakened Russia would still have the capability to destabilize and undermine political and economic progress in the country, and they will continue to do so without a major deterrent. Unenforceable terms are akin to no terms at all.

Right now, Russia's ambitions in Ukraine are hanging by a string. I'm not saying they'll necessarily be beaten back, but most of their original goals such a regime change etc. are likely off the table. If the Russians don't manage a dramatic breakthrough or somehow fix their supply issues under fire over the next week or so, there's a very real chance it all falls apart on them. Even if they avoid that, at a minimum they face a decade long insurgency they do not appear to have the resources or will to combat. Ukraine holds most of the good cards now, and should be negotiating from a position of strength.

Putin wins if he gets the previously occupied territory without any real concessions besides a ceasefire. The cost of those gains was simply delayed. Without a **real** security guarantee for Ukraine, Russia will continue to interfere with their sovereignty, and just try and wait things out for a point when Europe is less united, then they'll take another piece.",177834534cd05b8db88bf19c574367de9b5b8812,True,False,,,,,0,1647354023,,0,{},i0r2yhg,False,t3_tensbz,False,True,t3_tensbz,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tensbz/ukraine_megathread_march_15/i0r2yhg/,1647354035,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647325223.0,

&gt;The devices are each about a foot long, shaped like a dart and white with an orange tail... They are released by the Iskander-M short-range ballistic missiles when the missile senses that it has been targeted by air defense systems.

&gt;Each is packed with electronics and produces radio signals to jam or spoof enemy radars attempting to locate the Iskander-M, and contains a heat source to attract incoming missiles. 


&gt;“That Russia is using that size of weapon — the Iskander-M — and quite a few of them I believe, that’s why we’re seeing this now. It’s just that, post-conflict **in the past 10 to 15 years, no one has had the opportunity to see this.**”

&gt;The devices are similar to Cold War decoys called “penetration aids,” the intelligence official said, that have accompanied nuclear warheads since the 1970s and were designed to evade antimissile systems and allow individual warheads to reach their targets. The incorporation of the devices into weapons like the Iskander-M that have conventional warheads has not been previously documented in military arsenals.


&gt;“The minute people came up with missiles, people started trying to shoot them down, and the minute people started trying to shoot them down, people started thinking about penetration aids,” Jeffrey Lewis, a professor of nonproliferation at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, Calif., said in an interview. **“But we never see them because they’re highly secret — if you know how they work, you can counteract them.”**

&gt;**“I think that there are some very excited people in the U.S. intelligence community right now,”** he added.",77b60413891d1050530f6bbe9f37c26c428dc64c,True,False,,,,,0,1647353714,,0,{},i0r29aj,False,t3_tensbz,False,True,t3_tensbz,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tensbz/ukraine_megathread_march_15/i0r29aj/,1647353730,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647324914.0,

It's as simple as that. The US has not disclosed what they know so whatever is going on in the media is speculation.

Absent LL they cannot make high octane gasoline for aircraft making them even worse clay pigeons than historical.  They can’t nake locomotives (all of them were LL).  They can’t make radios.  They basically are machining steel with steel making their production even more hilariously low quality.

Absent the Strategic Bombing campaign the Luftwaffe is not siphoned off to the west and destroyed, and the Germans maintain control of the air.  This is an enormous force multiplier.  They have twice as much artillery and shells, and each Axis (not just German) division has a dozen more AT pieces. That is how much resources FlaK defense diverted. Overally their AFV/truck pool is about 25% larger

Absent British/US activity in the Med the Germans have an extra Flieger Corps, an extra Panzer Army, and a parachute corps available for Barbarossa, as well as an entire Army Group worth of trucks.  That’s how much effort the North African campaign diverted from Barbarossa

The German mobile formations don’t go into Barbarossa after fighting their way up and then down the Balkans

You take how much stronger the Germans would be here and how much weaker the Russians would be and it’s pretty much game over for them by 1943

After the war Zhukov said as much;  ""People say that the allies didn't help us. But it cannot be denied that the Americans sent us materiel without which we could not have formed our reserves or continued the war. The Americans provided vital explosives and gunpowder.

This is all explained by examination of the radar range equation. The USN/AF wont conduct SEAD with insuffiecient Intelligence and Reconaissance so they will know where to expect them generally.

Thrust to weight ratio helps supply energy to high alpha post stall maneuvres, but it isnt necessary for high speed. Strictly speaking it determines acceleration(s). A property for good top speed is low drag. To push the point, the Mig-31 and SR-71 had thust to weight ratios below 0.5 and travelled mach 3 or there abouts. The F-15 travels mach 1.2 or so with T/W &gt; 1. Therefore you can conclude they arent attributes of the same performance metric. Thrust to weight is strictly engine output. Tiltrotors are another example where thrust&gt;weight.

If you want to be supermaneuverable you have to consider thrust vectoring and large control surfaces.

Vastly poorer than the average American? Yes, unequivocally. Every large country is. Equating this with military power is a very fuzzy metric given the differences in purchasing power, population, and government structure.

Taiwan is a complex issue and it can't be expressed solely in military terms. If the PLA invaded and the ROCA got full backing from the US, the casualties would be horrific but I do think there is no way China could take the island. But consider: even if the US hung Taiwan out to dry and the ROCA completely crumbled, China would still lose. They would gain a likely badly damaged island full of people who hate them, with all its previously vibrant industries crippled. It would cost them diplomatic relations with dozens of countries, all kinds of sanctions, huge military buildup in all their neighbors, and a crushed economy. They would then have to invest in an ongoing occupation in one of the densest urban environments in the world with a bunch of nearby foreign powers interested in backing rebels.

When winning militarily is still losing, the most beneficial action is to use Taiwan as a chip for internal and external posturing and try to pick at the ROC with diplomatic, economic, and cultural pressure; exactly what China has been doing for decades.

So, in short, if stealth works, and the possible opponent has a very hard time countering the F-35, you might not depend that much in mobility/speed/thrust-to-weight. Advanced systems compared to older planes also can make big differences - situational awareness and *not being in the wrong place at the wrong time* surely helps a lot.

The problem of this approach is if a potential enemy develops a technology capable of detecting stealth planes. It already [surprised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_F-117A_shootdown) on the battlefield once. Then you'd be in a very bad shape to contest air superiority, possibly keeping a long distance and sniping shots BVR. This would eventually force F-35 operators to reactivate mothballed, old-gen but more agile fighters for different missions. Hell, its even possible to rework the existing F-35s to remove some of its stealth capabilities and increase its agility. 

Keep in mind that a fighter jet produced in such large amounts will definitely see improvements during its life cycle, possible new engines, reduced weight and other optimizations.

It is interesting to compare the [russian approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhoi_Su-57) to stealth: its is like a Pac-Man, stealth on the front side while neglecting side/back stealth in order to have 2 engines, supercruise, Mach 2,  supermaneuverability, higher ceiling , lower wing loading, better thrust-to-weight and more than twice the range. Its an entire different school of thought. Somehow they also have a [similar plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhoi_Su-75_Checkmate) as the F-35 in the works.

One factor not mentioned much is Russia's own fear of a war on the European continent escalating.

We are all very aware that Russia and NATO have a strong vested interest in not coming into direct conflict with each other, but both Russia and NATO will also be aware of how accidents can happen, bluffs not be called, and that can then lead to an escalation.

Russia likely wants to hold a chunk of their near-peer weaponry and forces in reserve in case the worst happens and they need to respond to NATO in a conventional fashion.

Lots of warnings from the US government to Russia that cyber attacks would be considered no different from conventional attacks and that Russia could expect a swift response from the US if it attempted to attack infrastructure or important companies.

In the context of the current conflict, Russia has been somewhat paranoid about how an effective cyberattack could overreach its intended target, and also cause problems for the US (or even Russia itself). The reason that Stuxnet was discovered in the first place was precise because of this kind of 'blowback' occurring. With the connectedness of so much via the internet countries with effective cyber offence are concerned about putting attacks out there. You risk opening a 'pandora's box' and devastating many unintended targets.

So this probably explains why Russia has been hesitant to use cyber - the domain has turned into its own 'mini' MAD scenario with major players hesitant to push the button and cause chaos.

It's also a bit unclear how effective such an attack would be against Ukraine, who have the 'benefit' of being the long-suffering target of Russian hackers. This has enabled them to 'harden' a lot of critical infrastructure.

That led to Finland, as big a disaster as happening now and Barbarossa the greatest disaster of the modern Russia\\USSR. But they scrambled around and plucked Zhukov from the far east and found others like Rokokovsky et al who could managed armies of that size and could orginise the logistics to meet the demands. The Party remained in command and kept the Chekists down for most of the rest of the period, so an army was able to be maintained that could function as one. 

But as Yeltsin fell apart they returned and turned Russia into a mafia, gangster capitalists state whos sole purpose was to feed the Cheka machine.

The whole VDV things was funny also because he said that Russia has not done combat jumps since the 1960's, but the number of combat jumps the US or other NATO paras have done has also dwindled, especially since helicopters became widespread, yet even the US still has airborne capability and air-assault capability, just as the VDV has airborne and air-assault capability. Now of course Russia has also fought fewer wars than the US has, so has had fewer chances to use its paratroopers.  


It's very much a force to take and hold ground until the armored spearhead get there, and it almost worked at Hostomel, with the armoured spearhead reaching the airfield only a couple of hours after the last paras were driven off.

So right now, not accounting for specific types the Ukrainians are at a net positive for vehicles.


Now, that's assuming every destroyed and captured vehicle is photogenic and is whitnessed. Which is probably over 50% we can't confirm.

I'm sure it's very different but it goes to show that while they are taking losses , Ukraine are getting stronger every day. And Russia is getting weaker every day.

It would be reported that 13% of the 125 Russian battle groups have been destroyed with 15%+ are in need or repair and replacements before fully combat effective.

Not only are bullets, bombs, missiles, helmets and bandages flowing into Ukraine by the billions of $$, they are mobilizing their reserves and the foreign Legion is becoming active. And their manpower is growing.

Russia has probably 20,000 casualties at this point, wiki today says 6k dead with about 14k wounded.

If the reports are true, 20,000 foreign volunteer have come to Ukraine, since the war began 140,000 Ukrainian citizens have also returned since Feb 24th. 80% are male and Id say, with salt in mind, probably 30% of males have come to contribute to the war effort (probably more but we're keeping the salt in mind) that has 37,000 who have joined the fight or are contributing to the war effort directly. On top of 102,000 paramilitary. On the 6th of march, reportedly 100,000 citizens have since joined the territory defense force.

So Ukraine has, Very roughly  259,000 citizen milita, paramilitary, and foreign volunteers. Combine those with the 209,000 regular army and we have 468,000 men and women who are defending Ukraine.

Russia started with 200,000 troops and roughly 35,000 ""little Republic army""(organized terrorist army)

468,000 pissed off Ukrainians vs a dwindling army of 205,000 soliders of the Russian side.

Time is the most important element right now. almost 19 days and the aid is flowing and the sanctions are hitting.

2 months Russia will enter unknown territory, or history will repeat its self 30 years later.

Russia is probably going to up their artillery attacks, increase air attacks. If they don't make significant gains from that then they could try and commit war crimes rather than ""accidentally kill thousands of civilians""


Getting away from the question, coming back it is possible with time and resources Ukraine can mount an offensive. Besides holding the capital returning Kherson is IMO the most important part of the war. Not only is it significantly stratigic in the southern front, it would be a huge moral boost to retake a major city.

While Russia has not achieved air superiority, they are the big bird in the air and Ukraine could not ever achieve enough presence to properly support a large scale counter offensive. But with enough time I believe it's possible.

Russia's time is running out, it won't be long before there's enough anti tank and Anti vehicle missiles to destroy every vehicle Russia can bring to the fight in the next 4 months.

Unless there is a major shift in the dynamics, Russia is stalled on the majority of fronts. If they are stuck forenough time the war could turn clearly in Ukraine's favor. 

TLDR: every day Russia gets weaker and Ukraine gets stronger. a counter offensive is possible but they are weeks and a stalemate away from it.",d7d50e84a5294fd597ac0fa110680ccf9ce9d4dc,True,False,,,,,0,1647320238,,0,{},i0pp8kb,False,t3_te0k3s,False,True,t3_te0k3s,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/te0k3s/if_russian_losses_continue_to_mount_and_air/i0pp8kb/,1647320251,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647291438.0,

The popular conception of nuclear war meaning total Apocalypse via nuclear winter comes from the TTAPS 1983 and 1990 models and corresponding papers. No other studies have affirmed those results. Most models affirm that there will be *some* nuclear winter effect, and it will have a serious effect on agricultural yields leading to famine, but it's not likely to be a civilization-destroying effect.

For China, the effect might be something like the Great Leap Forward. Not optimal, but not China-destroying either.

Civilization has endured worse. The Black Death killed something like 50% of the European population over the span of 5 years, which is about as long as modern models predict serious, agriculture-disrupting nuclear winter effects would last.

Secondly for all the talk about Russian massed artillery, you need to keep in mind that it is very supply inefficient. In order for that 155mm cannon to be dropping rounds into Kiev with any volume you're talking literal truck loads of ammo non-stop. IF the Ukrainians start cutting off units, the artillery fire is going to peter out because they'll run themselves dry.  The lack of smart munitions on the part of the Russians means that they need far more supply trucks to give them the volume they need to be effective.

I think if the Ukranians can start turning counter offensives and getting fast mobile light infantry loaded for bear with anti-tank weaponry, they are going to reek havoc in the Russian supply chain.

Their max range is also only 20km (30km for the S2 variant), and Ukraine is a big place, so I suspect they simply can't cover enough territory with what they have. Especially since they seem to be having logistics problems that may limit their ability even to physically transport the AA systems to where they are needed. 

Also, Armenia was not able to effectively counter these drones with Russian anti-air tech during the Nargono-Karabakh War a couple years ago. While Armenian AA was mostly outdated S-300 variants and similarly traditional integrated air defense systems designed before sUAS even existed (notably Armenia did _not_ have Pantsirs), the Russians did provide their latest and greatest counter sUAS polye system, which slowed the Azerbaijani drone activity for four days or so but ultimately proved ineffective against the Bayraktars. 

I'm guessing the Russians told themselves that the Pantsirs would be effective in Ukraine against small UAS where S-300/400s are not, so they didn't need to worry about the experiences of the Armenians. I know the Pantsir was designed in part to supplement and protect S-300/400 batteries, so it sort of makes sense that the Russians would be relying on them as a counter to sUAS.

Ukraine will not accept anything that doesn't give them a security guarantee with teeth like NATO. Anything short of that is an invitation for Russia to continue to violate their sovereignty. Russia has demonstrated that without such a guarantee they will continue to destabilize the country, and can do so even without using the kind of force they're using now and are willing to pay an astronomical price to do so. Even a Russia without Putin isn't enough to satisfy their concerns given the long colonial relationship between Russia and Ukraine 

Any negotiated settlement without that kind of guarantee is a win for Putin. His previous actions in Ukraine are rewarded, and leaves open somewhere down the line a better opportunity, perhaps when Europe isn't so united. Even if a deal included territory, a security guarantee for Ukraine would be a humiliation and likely the end of any further imperial ambitions or expansion of the Russian sphere of influence. The Russian army or the government has to break for that to be an option, and frankly breaking the army seems like a better option.

To be clear, anything else is appeasing Putin and rewarding his aggression, while sacrificing Ukraine. Appeasement has a poor record in regards to aggression in Europe. I'm frankly shocked at how many people view this as an acceptable option.

OP has a point: political instability in Belarus is incredibly dangerous to Russia's efforts in Ukraine. If the reports of the Belarusian military balking at participating in the conflict are true (and I'm inclined to think they are based on some of the past few ISW updates), then it is potentially something that can be exploited without having to commit NATO forces to the conflict. By allowing Russia to stage the invasion from its borders, Belarus is already a party to the war. Rattling a sabre a little at them would be totally appropriate, and pay outsized dividends if it keeps them out of the conflict, even more so if there's political upheaval and the new people in charge want to make it harder on Russia.

You're right, it's not civ. There's a fine line everyone not directly involved in the conflict has to walk here. But let's not be naive: Russia is a bad faith actor and unenforceable terms are tantamount to no terms when it comes to making agreements with them. They're willing to do things we would consider dumb and irrational and pay dearly for their perceived right to do so.

Some interesting things about Russia’s air forces:

-	American pilots get more flight training during their initial training pipeline than Russian pilots get in their first 10 years of service.
-	Their flight time is severely impacted by materiel readiness. Our mechs work straight up abusive hours to keep birds up. 
-	Western flight doctrine delegates weapons engagement authority to the pilot. It prizes the judgement and autonomy of pilots to make split-second decisions. Russian/Soviet doctrine gives weapons release authority to the ground station, even in air-to-air combat.
-	Russia generally has more maneuverable aircraft on paper BUT its pilots usually just train for 2D strike missions rather than 3D air-to-air scenarios. Couple the more difficult training of the West with the extra flight hours Western pilots log and you start getting a picture of the qualitative difference.
-	Russia does not have a similar joint doctrine to the US military’s. Their Air Force is just an Air Force, not a functional piece of a larger coherent defense structure.

In the invasion of Poland, which is generally remembered as a quick one-sided affair, Warsaw wasn't fully encircled for three weeks and the war lasted for 35 days even with the help of USSR invading from the other end. Wars like the Gulf War, the Iraq War, the invasion of Afghanistan etc. are the *outliers*. Historically, most armies in a losing war don't offer zero resistance and instantly collapse.

Ukraine is doing about as good of a job on defense as one would expect knowing that their army did not totally collapse. Their standing military is largely professionalized and has been steadily been reformed and modernized over the course of 8 years, on top of inheriting a gigantic arsenal of Soviet equipment. That said, they've already lost a lot of ground, the fate of strategically critical areas is currently in the balance, and to rescue a genuine victory would require them to go on a counter-offensive that they're probably incapable of.

Taiwan was basically a military dictatorship until 1987. Taiwanese democracy is relatively young and many would likely list economic development and wealth inequality as ranking far higher than democratic freedoms.

I feel you are a really out of touch with how most Taiwanese actually feel or think.

Democracy and civil rights are the fundamental fabric of modern Taiwanese society. The transition from a military dictatorship to one of the freest and most democratic societies in the developed world is the results of years of civil engagement, and almost always involved ""young Taiwanese"" and student movements.

The Wild Lily Student Movement is often credited as the turning point in the push for democracy:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Lily_student_movement

The Sunflower Student Movement which was more recent is where 400 students occupied the Legislative Yuan for almost a month while nearly 10,000 students camped outside in tents. This fundamentally changed the way Taiwan engages with China, both economically and politically: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunflower_Student_Movement

&gt;Many fledgling democracies have serious economic and development hurdles and many would choose higher incomes / standard of living over the ability to go to the polls every 4 years to choose yet another politician.

Evidence that is the case for Taiwan? 

Looking at this survey from [Pew Research that was released last year- ""What Makes Life Meaningful? Views From 17 Advanced Economies""](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/11/18/what-makes-life-meaningful-views-from-17-advanced-economies/).

Taiwan was the only country that ranked ""society"" in their top 5, and it was ranked #1... ""freedom"" was ranked #4 on the list for Taiwan, where it was 1 of only 2 countries that included ""freedom"" into the top 5.

&gt; In Taiwan, society – or the institutions and attributes of where people live – is the top source of meaning, above family, occupation and material well-being. Two women in Taiwan emphasize ease of living on the island: “Food, clothing, housing, and transportation are all convenient. Life is safe and tranquil,” and “There are many convenient stores in Taiwan … The public health insurance system is good; medical service is convenient.” Others note their satisfaction with Taiwan’s political system. One woman claimed she is “fortunate to live in Taiwan, especially in the aspect of public health, democracy, and the rule of law and human rights, because it is very free.” A young man simply noted, “Living in Taiwan is very free, freer than China and Hong Kong.” Some specifically mentioned their government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, like a woman who listed the island’s “stable economy, well-controlled new COVID-19 pandemic, [and] easy access to medical care” as meaningful.

That's another great point! Military intelligence should probably develop the ability to *quickly* find relevant videos and images shared on social media, locate them in place and time, and pass that information down to combatant units while it's still fresh enough to be actionable.

For western democracies, this all has additional ethical and legal realities to deal with. The military or intelligence agencies vacuuming up social media posts from citizens tends to be unpopular. Using social media to disseminate information to a domestic audience without clearly attributing it to a government agency is outright illegal in the US, I believe.

The simpler gist of it is the F-35 cram most things the F-16 and F/A-18 have to carry externally into a pretty efficient air frame.  The result being that a super clean F-16 is an energy monster that is insanely difficult even to this day to take on in WVR combat, but it has almost no fuel fraction in that scenario and is running no weapons and pylons, which would add weight and drag.  Basically they don't fly that way in combat all those pods, bombs, missiles and fuel tanks take a huge penalty on the performance.  The F-35 avoids those penalties and keeps all that stuff internal, look at fuel loads the F-16 carries 7,500lbs internal, the F/A-18 carries 10,500lbs internal, the F-35A carries 18,500lbs, the F-35B carries 14,000lbs internal, and the F-35C is 19,800lbs internal.  So looking at loaded weight it becomes more obvious why the F-35s lose on thrust to weight.

Cross what for other units would be a hard barrier  or an opening only small enough for them, then skirmish and wreak havoc on a flank tying up units.

&gt;More likely what we'll see is Beijing using a combo of the carrot / stick approach: threatening Taiwan with its overwhelming military while simultaneously offering generous reintegration terms and continuing investment.

&gt;From a political perspective, within Taiwan there's a real question if it's worth defending Taiwan. I know this sounds crazy, but the feeling on the ground is that Taiwan has built a fairly remarkable society from basically the ground up over the past 50 years and that a Chinese invasion will obliterate all of that. It's not clear there's a true willingness to sacrifice (unlike Ukraine) that life.

Of course we don't actually know until the bullets start flying, but the consensus seems to be pretty willing, especially for a fully developed country: 

[Taiwan Center for International Strategic Studies and the Taiwan International Studies Association](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2020/10/25/2003745764) poll:
&gt;Asked about their willingness to defend national security, 66 percent of respondents said that they would fight for Taiwan if a cross-strait war breaks out in the wake of Taiwan declaring independence, while 26.1 percent said they would not, the survey showed.
&gt;
&gt;**When facing an invasion by China, the ratio of people willing to fight for the nation rose to 77.6 percent**, and that of opponents fell to 15.9 percent, it showed.

[Poll conducted by National Chengchi University,](https://thediplomat.com/2019/03/are-taiwans-citizens-willing-to-fight-against-china/) from The Diplomat Magazine:

&gt;We asked 1001 Taiwanese respondents above 20 years old: “Is there a casualty threshold beyond which you will consider the conflict (with China) is not worth the trouble?” Subjects chose from six options: 1) 0 deaths; 2) 1 – 50 deaths; 3) 51 – 500 deaths; 4) 501–5,000 deaths; 5) 5,001–50,000 deaths; and  6) over 50,000 deaths.
&gt;
&gt;**The most popular categories were over 50,000 deaths (32.2 percent)** and 0 deaths (20 percent), whereas 51-500 deaths (7.7 percent) and 5,001-50,000 (9.9 percent) are the least selected options. The result is surprising, as there is not a linear association between battle deaths and Taiwanese tolerance of war. Existing studies on American support for war overseas have often pointed out that the higher the number of deaths, the less popular the war. Such a pattern is non-existent in Taiwan.
&gt;
&gt;According to the poll, about one-fifth of the population is completely opposed to war (not willing to tolerate a single death), **but many more were also willing to endure quite a significant number of fatalities (50,000).** This number is even higher than American support for the military mission in Iraq early 2003 (when public support for the mission was still high). At that time, only 11 percent of the public would tolerate a casualty threshold of 50,000.",8bb515dacc6f4fc32e7ff2df46fac5f44e9b3ab2,True,False,,,,,0,1647309016,,0,{},i0p2v2s,False,t3_tdxg6p,False,True,t1_i0o11b8,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tdxg6p/ukraine_megathread_march_14/i0p2v2s/,1647309031,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647280216.0,

I'd have to think they'd put these assets into play, knowing their air defense coverage would be challenged by stealth aircraft- knowing they'd need to cruise missile saturate everything, as hard as possible- and so on.   


You mentioned naval power- and i wonder about that. I still have to think that the scariest thing for a NATO ship or battlegroup is to have a Kuznetsov, a bunch of Sovernmennys, a Kirov, some Slavas- , coming towards you to launch mass Sunburns and Shipwrecks- while Oscars and attack subs surface and also spam missiles in bulk at the same groups.   
With Tu-22's contributing to the missile spam as well. (and yes, right now though the Kuznetsov is out of action, but they'd prefer it in an attack group)

Not getting wrecked by this sort of technique(which is the most dangerous situation possible for a NATO group) would require a LOT of CG's and DDG's ready to test if Aegis could handle the literal worst case scenario.  


Naturally, if the warheads are the nuclear variant, you're getting mission kills on every hit even moreso- but even without that, they'd not be in a good state- and Russia's best method of conquering seas would be submarines. (They have few of the high-end subs though, while Virginias aboud, and even with one damaged from an undersea mountain, Seawolves still would do the most punching above their weight class here)  


Their air situation is similar- not enough of the high end assets that would be tricky to act against- and if they did muster 5 or 8 or 10 SU-57's- they're compeeting against an intelligence apparatus that's on the lookout for their basing area, and in the air a lot of F-35's and F-22's when they get brought to the theatre- and the idea is to never fight fair, but strike critical assets with their low observable platforms- and this would be hard to do with hit and run attacks even. They'd want to actually pull from NATO's playbook, and tap into that precious reserve of PGM's, unleash their bomber fleet properly, and so on.  


Fighting NATO- they'd need to start using ASAT weapons , launch a cruise missile barrage like has never been seen before from their bombers, ships, and submarines all around targeting intelligence assets)- and try to establish an information flow so they could very carefully preserve their high value assets that are the most survivable, and use those to give cover to assets like artillery and SRBMs and cruise missile launchers , for the Baltics.  


I wonder if using attack subs to spam cruise missiles at bases throughout Europe would be a major disruption event (I've always though that a submarine launching Cruise missiles at DC and a few other spots even, could if targeted right slow down the US- although decapitation strikes I get the feeling wouldn't succeed.) - They would have to learn a lot immediately from the issues they've seen in Ukraine, and adapt immediately - as the logistics issues would be magnified , with NATO coming after them.

With the exception of military historians (at least in the Anglophone world) historians have been walking back from Great Man analysis for literally 60+ years. But that hasn't filtered out to pop culture conceptions of history like, say, pop history books written by journalists rather than historians or the vast majority of history buff podcasts and Youtube channels. Are foreign policy analysts reading these sources or actual historians? And, does it matter?

How often do foreign policy professionals interface with contemporary historical scholarship outside of military history? Are they reading contemporary historians or relying on stuff that was canonical 50 or 60 years ago? In particular military historians of the past and to some extent today were/are extremely conservative (in the academic/theoretical sense not political) and tended to treat military matters and military in a vacuum cut off from the rest of society. Since the 60s or so in the Anglophone world they've almost been a completely separate intellectual community from every other field of history and the social sciences more broadly (this might be less true today - I don't really read contemporary military history). And, as mentioned, pop history works draw heavily from these very narrow and sometimes quite dated viewpoints.

But obviously when it comes to strategy and analysis good decisions are being made and good analysis is being done by some people and less good stuff is being done and made by other people. I guess my question really is: do the people making better decisions make better decisions because they read better history and the people making less good decisions are reading worse/dated history?

1304,[],False,,Xyzzyzzyzzy,,,[],,,,text,t2_6qgej2g0,False,True,"&gt; But if you think there is something innovative or particularly new about this war please do share.

The importance of widespread, timely usage of social media in support of conventional military operations.

This was already heralded by successful social media usage among non-state actors, particularly in Iraq and Syria. And of course there's been successful social media campaigns not associated with conflicts, like the 2016 Russian campaign to influence the US elections, or the various grassroots activist movements that originated and spread on social media.

But I think this is the first time we've really seen large-scale use of social media to disseminate information, influence public opinion and achieve policy goals in the context of a conventional conflict between states. It shows that social media isn't just important for protest movements and insurgencies.

Ukraine's social media campaign has:

* Bolstered morale among its troops and citizenry by promptly sharing battlefield victories;
* Promoted a positive image of Ukraine as a modern, developed, democratic society under attack by a backward, autocratic empire;
* Attracted quite a few foreign volunteers (for whatever that's worth);
* Rallied public support for strong action to support Ukraine and punish Russia, even in places like Germany that previously had a very dovish approach to Ukraine;
* Drawn attention to Russian attacks against civilian infrastructure, further bolstering international criticism of Russia;
* Had an unknown but probably non-zero effect on Russian public opinion;
* Integrated grassroots social media usage among front-line units and normal people who I assume haven't been formally tasked with social media operations, *mostly* without compromising operational security. (I doubt this was intentional, but unintentional innovations can be just as impactful.)

Given what we know now, I think it's likely that Ukraine's swift, decisive social media campaign directly influenced European states' willingness to impose stronger-than-expected sanctions against Russia, and thus has already had a major . Of course it's possible that more hawkish allies like the US, UK, Poland and the Baltics had already secured a commitment from Germany to back strong sanctions and dramatically boost its defense spending, and public opinion shaped by social media had nothing to do with it. But think that any sanctions that had widespread support among NATO and the EU would have been publicized before the invasion, as a deterrent.

The social media campaign is *definitely* having a positive effect on keeping Ukraine in the news. Even among American media, with their notoriously short attention spans, Ukraine remains headline news over 2 weeks after the start of the invasion. This, again, helps to shape public opinion in favor of support for Ukraine and acts as a prophylactic against falling public support because of economic effects like higher gas/petrol prices. 

For example: in the US, the usual suspects are grumbling about gasoline prices for political gain, but the grumbling is much more muted than you'd expect for the highest gas prices in US history. If the current price spike were because of a war nobody knew or cared about then we'd be seeing street protests right about now. Remember the huge ""Freedom Convoy"" that shut down major cities in the US? Me neither - because it fizzled out over a week ago. Without the (true!) narrative that higher gas prices are Putin's fault and are the unfortunate but necessary cost of supporting freedom fighters in Ukraine, the ""Freedom Convoy"" probably would have been more similar to the Canadian version. That would have impacted how the US administration approaches the conflict, making it costlier to support Ukraine.

There will definitely be some lessons about social media operations during conventional conflict that other militaries can learn from, and I think the ones that apply the lessons will have an advantage over the ones that don't.",ce3352906c59a85955cbe1a9fa66e5fdbb1a81ee,True,False,,,,,0,1647304707,,0,{},i0otcbk,False,t3_te4kpe,False,True,t1_i0ocn1u,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/te4kpe/how_was_ukraine_able_to_conceal_its_true/i0otcbk/,1647304725,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647275907.0,

-unreachable political objectives dictating tactics and operations, 
-limited logistics partly due to previous things,

-political constraints on the use or force, especially artillery
- political optimism making the military use organisations against doctrine, going as far as not even using the BTG's in a concentrated manner before the Brovary ambush.
- lack of supporting elements even on the regimental/brigade level due to political optimism
- lack of higher level coordination (I'm not sure Russia has a single top commander for the operation)

What the first 4-5 days Ukraine got a lot better for that, they blew up a lot, which had forced Russia to detour, attempt pontooning, and made resupply chaotic.
They did do well in destroying the rail links early on though. That's one of the highest factors in crippling Russia's offensive, they aren't capable of full resupply over land. The destruction of key bridges, and hit and run attacks on supply convoys has also helped massively.

The assumption was that Russia was just as powerful an enemy as the Cold War mythos of the USSR made them to be. In reality they are clearly suffering from serious organizational issues, a lack of experience in supplying large scale operations, and a lack of modern equipment. Their military budget, despite having been increased significantly under Putin, is stretched across far too many systems and platforms to be utilized as efficiently as possible.

Everyone also assumed Ukraine's forces would fair about as well as they did in 2014, maybe a little bit better. The reality is that Ukraine did a lot to fix their deficiencies. Back then tons of their military equipment only existed on paper. They tried to break out stocks of weapons and vehicles only to find them completely unusable due to years of zero maintenance or accountability. Their communications were effectively shut down by the Russians. The Ukrainian military at that time would not have been considered a military by any modern standards.

In the interim they improved their technology, they replaced old and non-functional equipment, and they regularly rotated their troops in and out of combat zones to build up experience and give them a reserve component of many thousands of battle-tested troops.

They basically improved in every aspect that Russia had the advantage over them in while Russia did very little to improve at all in the meantime. For example, the Ukrainians modernized their radios so they wouldn't again be vulnerable to Russians turning them off.

I think that's hyperbolic. Ukraine has done phenomenally well, but they aren't South Korea. South Korea has 650k active duty personnel - that's not far off three times Ukraine - and several million in reserves. And their armed forces are substantially better equipped in every regard. With as much of a protracted threat as Ukraine had, and assuming a similar Russian strategy, South Korea would have achieved air superiority on the morning of the first day, stalled the Russian advance in the afternoon, and pushed them back beyond the border and into Russia on the second day. 

&gt;The overall number of the troops the Ukrainians had available was likely known, however the figures for portable weapons, tanks, armored vehicles, air-defense and artillery systems they were able to modernize and actually field appear to have been severely undervalued.  

I'm not sure there's evidence of this? I've not seen any suggestion that Ukraine had a bunch of AA and tanks hidden in a bunker somewhere. Possibly Ukraine achieved somewhat higher readiness than anticipated, but most of the shock in this campaign has been the extent to which they've been able to *preserve* key high value equipment, to employ it carefully where it can have the greatest impact, and continue to fight without it where necessary using man-portable kit.

1372,[],False,,BiAsALongHorse,,,[],,,,text,t2_k0qzi,False,False,"Not an aerospace engineer, but an aerospace engineering master's student. What you've linked is mostly talking about the control laws that translate pilot inputs and the state of the aircraft into commands to the control surfaces. Excellent control laws allow a pilot to keep the plane at angles of attack that optimize for (instantaneous or sustained) turn rates with relative ease. Optimum AoA depends on airspeed, structural/pilot limits and whether sustained or instantaneous turn performance is preferred, aircraft weight and air density among other factors. Additionally some airframes are great at sustained turn rates (like the F-16), while some are far better at getting extreme instantaneous turn rates through a mix of manageable stability at high AoAs and non-terrible aerodynamic efficiencies in those regimes (a particular strength of the super hornet).

It's also worth keeping in mind that the TWRs of the F-16, F/A-18 and F-35 largely overlap depending on the variant in question (not to mention fuel/weapons load). If we instead compare weight to \*excess\* thrust, which is thrust available minus the drag, we can expect this comparison to vary wildly depending on how fast the planes are flying, what altitude they're flying at and (crucially) what they're carrying. Having internal bays will give you a big advantage in the drag portion of that equation with a realistic combat load.

The other thing to consider is what indicated airspeed, mach number and AoA do to the thrust figure you're considering. All of these factors will have a huge effect on thrust, largely due to intake performance, particularly with how distinct the intake designs are between the aircraft. I'd be willing to bet that the superhornet has a distinct advantage at supersonic speeds due to the ramp intakes, and the picture is messy as all hell below the speed of sound. 

I'd also like to mention that we should be considering that body lift would obscure what we could otherwise conclude from wing loading. It's impossible to conclude anything about body lift without the results of CFD and real world data, but my guess would be that the F-35 (particularly the variants other than the F-35C) have somewhat higher aerodynamic efficiency than what the wing loading would suggest. 

So what we can conclude here is that the different airframes have a wide variety of peaks and troughs in performance across different flight parameters and loadings and with respect to different performance parameters. What you've linked suggests that the control laws used by the F-35 are far better at interpreting pilot intent and making the best decisions to balance those trade-offs in a wide variety of different situations. An F-16 pilot might be able to keep their airspeed and AoA perfectly optimal in a rate fight on the deck and beat an F-35 handily if they don't have any other goals, threats or distractions, but even in the most simple types of dogfight, a modern fighter pilot has a lot more work to do and decisions to make than managing speed and AoA. Computers are great at letting pilots offload those sorts of responsibilities and are often simply better than people when it comes to weighing a lot of different options dozens of times a second.",5662339b36a334094c45e37a8effd22fcd891ba1,True,False,,,,,0,1647302497,,0,{},i0oog31,False,t3_te6k2u,False,True,t3_te6k2u,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/te6k2u/how_does_the_f35_boast_comparable_mobility_to_the/i0oog31/,1647302515,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647273697.0,
