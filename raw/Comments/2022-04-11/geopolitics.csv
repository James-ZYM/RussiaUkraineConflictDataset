[],False,,RainbowCrown71,,,[],,,,text,t2_ekch7248,False,False,"**Submission Statement**: In this article by Stephen Cook, the author posits that the USA and its Middle Eastern allies are reaching a critical juncture by which their interests no longer align.

From Israel and Saudi Arabia's repeated criticisms of a new nuclear deal with Iran, to Israel's muted criticism of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, to Washington increasingly free to criticize human rights abuses by their allies (of which the Khashoggi killing was just the tip).

The core reason is that the energy world has completely upended from just a decade ago. In 2005, the U.S. imported a net 12.5 million barrels per day according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. In 2010, it was 9.4 million barrels per day. By 2017 (when Obama left office), it had dipped to 4.8 million barrels per day. In 2020, the U.S. became a net exporter of petroleum, a status it has maintained even through COVID-19, when the rapid collapse of oil prices seemed to threaten the ability of small oil rigs to stay in operation. In 2020, the U.S. averaged net exports of +635,000 barrels per day. In 2021, that dipped to +164,000 though high petroleum prices due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine (and Europe quickly shifting its energy security to North America as result) augurs a significant increase in net exports this year.

Essentially, the U.S. no longer feels bound to maintain a set of transactional relationships with powers in the Middle East. The Middle East has received the hint, and no longer feels compelled to play ball with the U.S. on foreign policy. 

From the article:

*""More broadly, the core interests that drove the United States in the Middle East—the free flow of oil and helping to ensure Israeli security—no longer seem so urgent. Yes, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has underlined the importance of Middle Eastern oil for the moment, and the energy transition was never going to be as smooth as some imagined. But as the process of adapting alternatives to oil starts picking up speed (the U.S. intelligence community estimates this will begin after 2030), the oil fields of the region will be less important to the United States. Already, U.S. policymakers have signaled that they no longer want to defend and sacrifice for Middle Eastern energy security. One of the least controversial things former U.S. President Donald Trump did in office was not respond to the 2019 attack on Saudi Arabia. Israel is a fully industrialized country with a GDP on par with U.S. allies in Europe and a proven track record of defending itself. It is also slowly being integrated into its neighborhood. The Israelis have excellent relations with one-time antagonists Greece and Cyprus, and the Turkish government is seeking a new relationship with Jerusalem. Of course, there are its new partners in the Arab world—Bahrain, the UAE, and Morocco—to go along with Jordan and Egypt.*

*It seems that the United States and its friends in the region have come to a juncture where their interests no longer align. Officials in Washington and across Middle Eastern capitals could reconfigure relationships that are getting old based on a new set of goals, but the ones the United States may have in mind—countering China and Russia or perhaps integrating Iran into the region to stabilize it—have no takers. In the breach, you have weird developments like the United States’ Middle Eastern partners passively supporting Russia and deepening their ties with China. Perhaps the more accurate term for these developments is “morbid symptoms” marking the death of the U.S. order built after World War II and the uncertainty over what comes next.""*",2706fbc8043b26b9276b0d2b934cdb678f0f7c62,True,False,,,,,0,1649715292,,0,{},i4cmls6,True,t3_u1ixgu,False,True,t3_u1ixgu,/r/geopolitics/comments/u1ixgu/americas_middle_east_friendships_are_dying_a/i4cmls6/,1649715305,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649686492.0

One could describe what Russia is doing in those terms.

Major differences exist.

(1) The American invasion of Iraq was followed by a Shia-dominated government that soon aligned itself with Iran, an American enemy. This is obviously not the outcome that the US intended, but the puppet government charge doesn't stick, because the US-installed government in Baghdad was clearly not under Washington's control in any meaningful sense. 

Afghanistan is not as clear cut, because their government really did fall without US presence, and hence was really a puppet government. But considering that the alternative was Taliban rule (basically ISIS-lite), I'm not sure what else the Americans should have done.

(2) Putin's invasion of Ukraine is heavily motivated by irredentism, by his own admission. This is what caused WW2, and wars motivated by irrendentist territorial ambitions have been incredibly rare since then. I only count the Chinese invasion of Tibet and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait as the only examples.

""What made Russia’s invasion so shocking was its anachronistic nature. For decades, this kind of territorial conquest had seemed to be a thing of the past. It had been more than 30 years since one country had tried to conquer another internationally recognized country outright (when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990). This restraint formed the basis of the international system: borders were, by and large, sacrosanct.  
Compliance with the norms of state sovereignty—including the notion that a country gets to control what happens in its own territory—has never been perfect. But states have generally tried to observe the sanctity of borders or at least maintain the appearance of doing so. Countries could rest assured that of all the threats they faced, an invasion to redraw their borders was unlikely to be one of them. With a main cause of war largely consigned to history, this particular brand of conflict became less common.

Now, with Russia’s invasion, the norm against territorial conquest has been tested in the most threatening and vivid way since the end of World War II. The war in Ukraine is reminiscent of a previous, more violent era. If the global community allows Russia to subsume Ukraine, states may more frequently use force to challenge borders, and wars may break out, former empires may be reinstated, and more countries may be brought to the edge of extinction.  
However disturbing Russia’s attack may be, the rest of the world can still protect the norm that Moscow has challenged. The global community can use sanctions and international courts to impose costs on Russia for its blatant and illegal aggression. It can press for reforms at the UN so that Security Council members, Russia included, cannot veto a referral to the International Criminal Court and thus hamstring that institution’s ability to mete out justice. Such a response will require cooperation and sacrifices, but it is well worth the effort. At stake is one of the bedrock principles of international law: the territorial integrity of states.""
