A LOT of us saw it spreading around, under fake, misleading or inaccurate titles/links before it was picked up by the world. She most likely found it the same way I did - completely unintentionally.

I realize that there is not a lot of news coming out of the area, but based on the scope of Ukrainian/NATO intel over the course of this event, safe to say its in their capability to do so.  


Let's assume its true for a second, what would this mean hypothetically? This is not something that would automatically warrant an escalation on NATO's part. It would likely depend on several factors, but I think its most likely that it does not cause a change in posture. This is due to the amount of support the west feels they have pledged Ukraine, especially recently. They will want to give it a chance to get on the battlefield. We can debate whether its enough or fast enough in another forum. They likely keep status quo and allow UA the chance to repel Russia in the east because that would still be the best outcome for Ukraine and the west, so I expect that is the approach they will take.

If they for whatever reason did decided to intervene hypothetically, and frankly what is the difference between hitting a train station full of civilians and using nerve gas other than a few acronyms? I guess it depends on scope, but lets just assume the red line has been crossed for whatever reason. Likely we would be the last to know. I doubt there would be any verbal warning or ultimatum. I can see NATO trying to act in a solely defensive capacity, offering air support to Ukraine either in the form of NFZ or ground attack. They would stop well short of anything that could be construed as ""offensive or threatening to Russia"" in hopes that Putin will not escalate. 

At that point, it would be Putin's turn to to show the world if he is for real, and obviously the risk and ramifications are enormous, but they are no less enormous for him than for anyone else involved. Putin talked about the guys that eat beluga caviar and all that, but he is one of those guys. Would he really be willing to take it to nuclear despite a love tap telling him to back off, and would NATO be willing to bet humanity that he wouldnt go nuclear in response?

Putin is committing to a genocidal war of depopulation in Eastern Ukraine now.  The West has not committed to actual boots on the ground and the accompanying air support, armor and infantry.  I admire the bravery of the Ukrainians, damn Braveheart style shit there, but this is not Israel in the 6 day war. The open ,flat, lightly forested terrain of the Donbas will not be conducive to the tactics the Ukrainians used around Kiev.  I wish it were so, but me wishing will not make it so.

I think right now to think of any kind of economic recovery is getting ahead of ourselves.  The Ukrainians have to work towards some agreeable solution, whether that is a total expulsion of Russian forces or some other agreement they can live with.

I absolutely did not intend to indicate that Ukraine would have fabricated it. 

 I thought that maybe there's a chance that it's actually some random pedophile video(maybe even a western pedophile, there are plenty in west too), where Russians themselves have deepfaked their own soldiers face on it. Then later, when west condemns it and there's a huge hysteria in media and social media, the Russians arrest the perpetrator and the investigation ""reveals"" the original video, indicating it was western pedophile all along (Not related to Ukraine war at all.) and claims that it was probably faked by west. 

This would be very demoralizing for west and huge propaganda victory for Russia.",a84622c57dfe0629a93675e780f167ade70c53d8,True,False,,,,,0,1649682081,,0,{},i4aenww,False,t3_u10nfe,False,True,t1_i4adnso,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/u10nfe/russian_soldier_who_filmed_himself_raping_a/i4aenww/,1649682096,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1649653281.0,,,,

People may claim to be sceptical about his arrest and rightly so, but having read about various cases over the years and about the deep disgust Russian society has for those that sexually assault children and the various repercussions. I don't doubt that it isn't true.

I also don't really expect to see any form of further official Russian confirmation of this and I suspect the dude might just end up with a bullet to the head and his body dumped. I really doubt that his family will even want the body to bury.

Russia could potentially show case his trial to show that they are ""against abuses"" and this guy was an outlier, but that would need to be weighed against the negative publicity. If he ends up in a prison, then he'll meet a very brutal end.

The intelligence, weapons, training, financial and humanitarian support the US has provided has made these 45 days of surviving this war possible for Ukraine. There are other influential European partners too obviously, but now is not the time to be choosey for help as long as interests are aligned. I would anticipate European influence to become greater if Ukraine becomes an EU member (as it should).

Trump was a wake up call to Europe that the need to be prepared to protect their own interests without relying on the US. This situation has always been present - the promises of the American government are only as good as the next President / Congress. Trump wanted to exit NATO, which would have wounded NATO immensely, and as we see with this conflict, could have put Europe in real jeopardy. This situation has reaffirmed the need and strength of NATO, but it has exposed some cracks in the relationship.

Ukraine has a friend in the Biden Administration, the Democrats, most Americans, and fortunately, many Republicans. Trump is a grifter, who is power hungry and ready to do anything is handlers want of him if he believes it will bring him power and prestige.

Germany first blocked the transfer of German made weapons to Ukraine. Then they conveniently sunk Nordstream 2 which was possibly politically untenable even before the war. Then they shipped a bunch of rusted and non-working weapons to Ukraine, pretty much as a rubbish collection service.
