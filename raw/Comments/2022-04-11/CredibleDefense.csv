Biden just followed through on the peace Deal (Doha Agreement) that Trump/Pompeo made to exit Afghanistan.

&gt; Biden was about to surrender to Iran and let them resume building nukes.

The Trump administration withdrew from JCPOA, the agreement which set forth a binding regime of disclosures and inspections to ensure Iran was not able to build a nuclear weapon. Since withdrawal, Iran has increased enrichment and inventory of Uranium. The Biden Administration is trying to restart a deal framework that would allow international oversight and prevent nuclear weapon development in Iran.

And here is the thing, people do consider Taiwan to be part of China. Taiwan was taken from China in the First Sino-Japanese War, an indisputable fact. People making the argument that the PRC never ruled Taiwan misses the point, if Japan is 'fine' to take land by war and it's fine and dandy, then no matter what the PRC does so long as they could get a treaty out of Taiwan, in the end, it is just as 'fine' as Japan taking Taiwan from China. 

However, if people are to recognize that Taiwan is part of the Chinese state or that the Chinese state has a very strong claim to Taiwan and there needs to be a serious discussion, just the way how the Union had a serious claim on the Confederacy, and if a political settlement is unavailable then war became one of the outcomes. 

Chinese actions are imperialistic just like American actions are imperialistic, but Taiwan isn't an imperialistic act. It is a largely Han-settled region for over 400 yrs. It was indisputable who owns Taiwan prior to the 20th century and we can trace the precise moment it cease to be Chinese, after the First Sino-Japanese War. An irredentist movement is a more precise description of the Chinese motivation rather than imperialistic. Chinese position in the SCS, ie, the 9-dash line, is imperialistic. Not Taiwan.

NATO was created and existed as a military alliance to contain Soviet and Warsaw  Pact military expansion against its neighbors. 

Upon the breakup, former Soviet republics and Warsaw Pact states who had been vassals of the USSR wanted protection to never again be under the thumb of Russia, who had defacto controlled the USSR and then controlled the Russian Federation. NATO let them in because they desired it and met the qualifications that can be found on [NATO's website](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2016_07/20160627_1607-factsheet-enlargement-eng.pdf).  

*- These criteria include a functioning democratic political system based on a market economy* 

Does this sound like Russia in the early to mid 2000s?  Especially under Putin? The economic oligarchy is a free market economy? 

*- Fair treatment of minority populations.* 

In the timeframe you're talking about they had just outright leveled Grozny after invading it again to kick off the 2nd Chechen War. 

*- A commitment to resolve conflicts peacefully*

See Chechen Wars throughout 1990-2000s, when [this](https://i.redd.it/t29djsge62h81.jpg) happened  

*- an ability and willingness to make a military contribution to NATO operations*

This is too laughable to even contemplate. Read up on how Russia tried to undermine the Bosnian and Kosovo operations because they were buddies with Serbia. And NATO should intentionally want them involved in all future operations? 

*- A commitment to democratic civil-military relations and institutions*

ROFL

And that doesn't even factor in other known commitments, like the willingness to serve under and carry out orders of SACEUR, which would always be an American. That's laughable to even suggest Russia would ever subordinate themselves to the West, its pretty much insulting to even suggest they'd do it. 

So what are we really talking about? That we should have offered as a meaningless gesture knowing that NATO and the Russians wouldn't want it and that the rest of NATO would flip the fuck out? 

All told, NATO in relation to Russian foreign policy is immaterial. What needs to be reviewed is how Russia treats its neighbors in the past, which has been outright terrifying. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, when NATO was a joke, only a few countries too it seriously and most of them were **THE ONES ON THE RUSSIAN BORDER.** 

Why did both Georgia and Ukraine want to join NATO? To stop the invasions that ultimately happened. Why did the other states join NATO in the 1990s and 2000s? Because if they hadn't it was only a matter of time until Putin started openly questioning the notion of their historic independence. 

During the very time you're talking about that we should have offered Russia an olive branch to join the organization designed to stop them, what did Russia do? They invaded and attempted to utterly destroy a breakaway republic trying to do the same thing nearly every other former republic or Warsaw Pact ""ally"" wanted to do: tell Russia to fuck off. NATO exists to tell Russia to fuck off. 

Rather than attempting to undermine NATO from within, Russia could have made NATO useless by demonstrating conduct that shows a massive and expensive military alliance designed to counter Russia isn't needed. 

Did they do that in the 1990-2000s? No. Even more so, they didn't do that after the time period in question. Instead they spent nearly three decades proving NATO needs to be stronger. 

More so, that any state on Russia's border is behooved to join it ASAP before the Russian army can recover from its current debacle.",ca1557f5faa555f8b57539da27717d58e78e189d,True,False,,,,,0,1649712986,,0,{},i4cgwl0,False,t3_tyfct0,False,True,t1_i3szqeg,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tyfct0/bill_clinton_why_i_expanded_nato/i4cgwl0/,1649712998,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649684186.0

So if we take all frigates and corvettes out of the equation due to not being major enough, as well as all destroyers not yet fitted out (6), you're left with 49 major surface vessels.

Japan by comparison has:

a) Tank losses tend to happen either on roads or on open terrain (as its where tanks can move), both of which are easy to approach and photograph, while airplanes... fall wherever, including dense forest, swamps, lakes and other bodies of water. Which makes for less aircraft crash sites to be photographed.

b) the majority of aircraft losses do in fact take place in the very east as you mentioned. And while I do not have data on this (and I would love for someone to locate the Oryx recorded losses on map), I wager that the forces in the east and the air defence forces in particular are not sharing as much photographic evidence as TDF, partisans and others. (due to opsec reasons, discipline etc)

c\*) Aircraft, even after getting shot at and becoming damaged, can still fly a substantial way, back to Russian controlled territory (but a damaged tank might not)

While I do have very low confidence in Ukrainian claims for the Russian air losses, there is also one indirect supporting piece of evidence (or logic). When compared to Soviet Afghan war, where the personnel losses were roughly on the scale as they have been in this war for Russia (as I said, I have much higher confidence in ground material including manpower loss claims from Ukraine). USSR lost 333 helicopoters and 118 jets (according to Wikipedia). The conditions are different. The mountainous terrain of Afghanistan gave an advantage to Afghans compared to Ukraine, but Ukraine has actual air defence systems compared to Afghans. Since I believe that Russian manpower losses have been around equal to the losses suffered in Afghanistan, I find it a plausible supporting piece of evidence to the claims that the aircraft losses too have been roughly equal.",20f21207d534bcd7793994c8f6fa61ca5fbf39a6,True,False,,,,,0,1649711730,,0,{},i4cdp98,False,t3_u163bl,False,True,t1_i4carvq,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u163bl/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_11_2022/i4cdp98/,1649711744,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649682930.0

[],False,,sanem48,,,[],,,,text,t2_101wsk,False,False,"For sure, unfortunately they've been waiting for the US to approve weapon sales. Also they're spending as much as $150 million for a single unarmed Reaper drone, about as much as the cost of a new F-16. They're also buying the Harpoon missiles which have less than 70 miles range.

By contrast India has had the BrahMos missile in use since 2007, and now also to be introduced in the Philippines. They could have ordered this missile years ago, for twice the cost of a Harpoon it has 4 times the speed and range (possibly more if they buy range upgrades). This also makes it a much more useful offensive weapon, something the US has refused to sell to Taiwan for fear of antagonizing China. India seems to have no such qualms as it is offering them to all countries in the region that might end up having to face off against China.

My point being that for the billions Taiwan is paying to the US for long delayed but relatively small weapons packages, it could have already bought and deployed thousands of superior missile systems from India alone.

With such an stock of top end, hypersonic missiles, Taiwan would be able to obliterate any Chinese ship with ease in a matter of minutes at 300 km range, whilst also covering much of China's coast line and possibly cities with these hybrid anti-ship/cruise missiles. If deployed at Lienchiang they could even threaten deep inside mainland China.

Instead Taiwan wasted years to spend all its budget on 4 unarmed drones, a few squadrons of 50 year old design jets that will make for nice target practice since they lack stealth (despite costing as much as an F-35), and anti-ship missiles that lack the range for anything but defensive missions (and their F-16s can only carry these, and not the more capable Taiwanese, Japanese or Indian ones).",1f36c383b6dc9f7d0a00d55ee7a8cf2bde906f3a,True,False,,,,,0,1649710172,,0,{},i4c9n10,False,t3_u0uyth,False,True,t1_i49pizd,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u0uyth/winning_the_fight_taiwan_cannot_afford_to_lose_a/i4c9n10/,1649710186,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649681372.0

&gt;I'm sure by say 2025, Russia will have no problems raising debt.

I'm not so sure. The reason the West freaked out about this invasion is because Russia invaded its neighbor with essentially no casus belli, after repeatedly denying that it had any plans to invade Ukraine, and caused a massive refugee crisis on Europe's doorstep. Russia didn't even bother pretending it was interested in dialogue and as such, threw away the rules based international system. 

That's why they have been hit with much harder sanctions. Their actions in the Donbas and Crimea were limited and had at least a veneer of rationale behind them. This was just naked aggression, not dissimilar to what Saddam did to Kuwait in 1990.

What I mean by this is that I will by default not trust any random source claiming non-provable things. I.e ""unknown Ukrainian blogger writes: we destroyed 10 Russian tanks"". Unless that claim has some video/photo evidence (or a source for these) then this is a non-provable claim and should be dismissed. Only accept OS claims if they have evidence.

However fundamentally not all true things have photographic evidence and in order to simply not take in any information, you have to apply some credibility metric to gain some possibly useful information about the state of affairs.

Institutions that have some degree of credibility, that gives substance to their non-provable claims: relevant government institutions, well-respected media, some occasional expert.

These institutions CAN have some credibility, which gives weight to their non-provable claims. However not all of them are equal and these things are not constant. If an institution keeps making claims that are being proven true in the future, then this strengthens the credibility and if proven untrue, degrades credibility. It is not an on-off thing in general though.

When it comes to Ukrainian claims of destroyed Russian equipment, I in general see that the claims are roughly in line with what seems true by later proven evidence (Oryx being one, but also less direct evidence such as Russia withdrawing from Kyiv and Chernigiv indicated that Russian losses are severe, Russian looting and war crimes indicate a dissolution of morale etc). 

There is an inherent bias in Ukrainian claims, in that they are fundamentally interested in showing progress at destroying Russian army. However they are also interested in not destroying their credibility (not a concern for Russia btw). These biases have to be taken into account.

Ukrainian claims for the shot down jets deviates substantially from the average ratio of claimed/proven and therefore raises questions about its credibility. I absolutely agree. However in case of Ukrainian claims, I am not ruling that claim out from the range of possibilities (though it is improbable). But Ukraine has enough credibility in my eyes, that I do not dismiss their claims right away. Russia on the other hand - instantly out.

But please understand that not all sources coming from Ukraine do not have the same level of credibility. Not all government sources are of equal credibility either.

That is the clincher of this explanation: its ruthless but a clever military decision to keep the civilian population in the dark so they don't clog up the roads while military forces are moving. But if the UAF don't take advantage at that time and move their military forces before the invasion then they wasted the opportunity. What ends up, and actually did happen, is they started moving their forces when the Russians did invade, when the civilian populace was also made aware at the same time, so traffic jams were still likely.  

There was no major troops movements done on D-2 or D-1 by the UAF, they fought with what was present in the areas, did a great job, but the major troop movements and the mobilizing of their reserves happened after the invasion started (we need to factor in the UAF reserves, since it was critical to the defense of the country). 

I think someone made up a flimsy answer whereas the real one is far simpler and understandable: the Ukr govt didn't mobilize, to include not only moving troops but also calling in its reserve forces before hostilities started, because they viewed is as a provocation to trigger a Russian invasion that wasn't assured at the time, despite US and UK intel assessment. 

At the time, we need to remember there was talk about false flags attacks and other means to try to get Ukraine to provoke an attack. The Russians even moved into Separatists controlled Donbas and were shelling Ukraine proper and Zelenskyy still refused to respond, to avoid being seen as an aggressor. If they mobilized it would have to be done openly, with public addresses by Ukr govt with reasons given. At that point the Russians would have to invade ASAP. 

And let's not forget that US and UK intel fucking sucks. For everything they get right they miss a billion other things. Remember the estimations of how long it would take for the Taliban to take Kabul? That was last summer.

1. Ukrainian armed forces being weak and not really fighting back
2. The West being weak and doing at most half-assed sanctions

Putin was extremely wrong about #1, but he was mostly right about #2. Europe is still buying Russia's oil and gas and sending Russia a billion euros every day for it. All 300 Russian banks except 7 are still in SWIFT. Sanctions have been mostly symbolic, some yachts seizures and such nonsense of no military significance. NATO did not join the fight, did not establish a no fly zone, did not send Ukraine any weapons necessary to take their land back, and the heaviest equipment sent over was a dozen or so old Soviet tanks from the Czechs, more than month into the war. Western reaction was maybe a tiny bit stronger than Russia would have hoped for, but really not by much.

There was no way to assume #2 back when Trump was president. For all Russia knew, Trump might have droned Moscow to stop the invasion, just like he killed terrorist leader Soleimani.

Biden showed himself to be weak over and over, and even today US is being cowardly. Biden surrendered to the Taliban. Biden surrendered the fight over Nordstrom 2 which Trump was trying to stop for his whole presidency. Biden was about to surrender to Iran and let them resume building nukes. After the invasion, the first thing US did was shot down any idea of NATO intervention of any kind, just letting Ukraine fall, and letting Ukrainian people get genocided. He was weak, and is still weak.

Still not as bad as Germans who are literally funding Russian genocide, but that's not much.

This is nonsense. [Trump started sending weapons to Ukraine, something Obama refused to do despite Congress passing Ukraine Freedom Support Act](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/lethal-weapons-to-ukraine-a-primer/).

They can only borrow money in foreign currency from foreign markets (i.e not by their own laws, but by the laws of a respectable country). They have to pay a higher interest rate (making their financial situation harder) and will not be given any leeway if things do not go well.

When Argentina has an economic downturn capital starts fleeing because they know things go bad financially.

**Bolding of the text is mine**

Russian loss rates, with the present evidence, are already reaching levels that compare to some of the worst losses of the US Civil War or World War I.

What do we know? According to the US briefing today about 40 out of 130 BTGs have been so thoroughly wrecked that they are not functional and have been withdrawn entirely. This loss rate of approx 30% seems to be mirrored in overall Russian casualties (maybe an underestimate)

The Ukrainians are claiming that 19,500 Russian soldiers have been killed. Other sources have not estimated for a bit. However if about 30% of BTGs have been rendered inoperable, and you include losses in other services (marines, spetznaz, airborne) 19.5k is not a bad baseline

If you simply double the amount of killed to take into account wounded, prisoners, etc, and add together you get almost 60,000 in total, which would be 30% of the original invasion force. This seems all seems plausible. Could be 5K more or less, but lets use that as a comparison.

Compare this to the US Civil War. The general with the highest average casualty rates was none other than Robert E. Lee. His troops suffered around 20% casualties on their campaigns--so the Russians are already far higher than that. https://historynet.com/the-butchers-bill/#:~:text=In%20contrast%2C%20Lee%20had%20greater,first%2014%20months%20in%20command%20(

The Butcher’s Bill | HistoryNet
Ulysses S. Grant is often referred to as a ‘butcher,’ but does Robert E. Lee actually deserve that title? It’s one of the old standbys of Civil War

World War I. The Battle of the Somme as a comparison. The British, French and Germans deployed about 3.5 million soldiers combined and lost about 1,050,000 casualties. Guess that rate--30%. So the Russians are already at Battle of Somme casualties. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Somme#:~:text=More%20than%20three%20million%20men,Chantilly%20Conference%20in%20December%201915.

Battle of the Somme - Wikipedia

And the Battle of the Somme lasted more than 3 months (late June through late September 1916) so the losses in this famous battle occurred in twice the time that is has taken the Russians to lose so much.

Now for a World War II comparison--the German Army in the Battle of Kursk, what is often seen as the greatest armor battle in history. While German losses are actually not easy to calculate, by any measures the Russian Army in Ukraine is suffering more losses.

During the 6 weeks of Operation Citadel and the subsequent Soviet counteroffensive the Germans suffered between 160k-200k casualties of the more than 900k soldiers deployed. this is somewhere between 17% and 22%

Battle of Kursk - Wikipedia

**So Russian losses by historic comparison are massive. Higher than German losses in the Kursk Campaign, higher than Robert E. Lee's campaign average and equal to the Battle of the Somme (in half the time).**

In all these cases, the armies were exhausted a needed to cease operations and recover. I would imagine this occurs soon to the Russians. They might have one real effort left in them--but hard to see how they could keep going.

And say I’ve overestimated Russian casualties by 50% and they are ‘only’ 40k as opposed to 60k. This would put them exactly at German Kursk and Robert E Lee casualty rates.

Portions of sovereign debt constantly come due. But few countries run a surplus so they always need new debt even if they are paying their total debt down. This means they have zero chance of ""rolling over"" their debt, that is borrowing $10 to replace $10 in debt. 

There currency is already basically unconveratable to dollars, euros or pounds. So all the things they have to buy into their economy, even from China are now unbuyable. They money they do have coming in has to keep the oil, gas and other resources industries ticking over. 

Their modern weapons systems rely on advanced components from western companies that are sanctioned and will only take dollars. 

In some ways the default was ""priced in"". That is everyone expected it. But they had made a couple of payments already.

In real terms this means the negative economics of pricing this in are set in stone and what ever deal they offer to lift sanctions will not lift most of the negative economic consequences. In fact those consequences are going to feed in a negative downward spiral.

[],False,,randomguy0101001,,,[],,,,text,t2_71y8f9gm,False,False,"&gt;First, a blockade is irrefutably an act of war. The modern observer's perception of blockades is muddled by the frequency and ineffective nature of embargoes during the Cold War and beyond. An embargo differs from a blockade in that an embargo prevents trade of the enemy nation with you, while a blockade prevents trade with everyone. The US, by its outsized trade footprint, has embargoed several states in a way which may resemble a blockade, but is not an overt act of war because you can't make me trade with you. China has actually implemented a partial embargo on Taiwan in the past few years, by limiting the import of certain Taiwanese goods, the most famous example being pineapples, which prompted a global surge in demand for Taiwanese pineapple that actually increased its export sales. An actual blockade would imply China stopping and potentially seizing neutral shipping, including American shipping.

I don't think there is such a thing as a partial embargo. Trade restrictions aren't always embargos while embargos are trade restrictions. Taiwan wants to sell certain kinds of goods to China but refuses these kinds of goods from China, very much doubt Taiwan will come up in the WTO courts but we will have to wait and see. As for whether one could potentially seize neutral shipping, well, you are running a blockade. 

&gt;This would mean that, for a partial war effort which would not instantly bring Taiwan to its knees, China would suffer all the diplomatic setbacks a regular war would entail. 

This assumes energy suppliers not only ran the Chinese blockade but also successfully. Is a 10 days 'instantly'? Probably not. But the point of a blockade is probably not instantly. 

&gt;Worse than that, the right of American merchants to go anywhere and sell anything around the world has always been policy and casus belli for the Americans. During WWI, America's eventual declaration of war on Germany was directly caused by German Unrestricted Submarine Warfare which killed Americans and impacted American sale of both war contraband and regular goods across the Atlantic. In WWII, the Lend-Lease program was another demonstration of America's commitment to trade as both a tool and a goal of war. And at the very beginning of the Cold War, the American-led Berlin Air Lift was a weighted response to Soviet attempts at blockading West Berlin, as well as a potent demonstration of Allied logistics capability. In the case of a blockade on Taiwan, the President of the United States would have all the moral and historical justification to call China's bluff by sending supplies to Taiwan, forcing China into a zugzwang where they must take the loss, or fire on American ships and risk bringing America into the war.

Any Chinese policymakers would have studied both world wars and knows that while the American public was against going to war the administration was always for it. Thus, the acts you mentioned are mere excuses necessary to justify American intervention. 

Thus it depends on what they take from these lessons. Is it inevitable? Or is taking an American merchant ship the same as hitting Hawaii? 

&gt;Second, it is no good just saying you’re blockading a nation (""I didn't say it, I declared it!""). You must also enforce it. 

Well, if you want to sail without insurance. 

&gt;The waters around Taiwan are one of the most busy areas for maritime traffic. Lots of ships, not just those bound for Taiwan, traverse the Straits. 

Yes, and then they can just take a 50 nm shift to not sail close to Taiwan's east coast, and just not take the straits. 

If a captain has 2 options, of just fail freely in certain areas, or risk getting boarded by the Chinese, would any neutral captain just to stick it to the Chinese? Perhaps, but they would probably be limited. A sealane isn't a 'lane' precisely, you can move a bit out.


&gt;Crucial imports and exports for Japan, South Korea and even China itself would be at risk, and all three are net food and energy importers with an outsized export footprint, just like Taiwan. This means you can't just shoot at any ship in the area like the Germans did in the Atlantic, you must patrol, intercept, board and potentially seize merchant ships, a logistically challenging undertaking even if China had complete naval dominance in the area, which it does not. 

This is based on a faulty interpretation of how sealane works. 

&gt;The chance of misunderstanding with a Japanese or Korean ship spiralling out of control into a declaration of war border on the inevitable, even if Japan was a fully complicit partner instead of having a superior deep ocean navy and an intense hatred for China stemming from eight centuries of political rivalry.

Sorry, what right did the Japanese have for this 'hate'? Did any Chinese army invade and occupy Japan? Burn and rape their way through the Japanese capital? Destroyed countless villages and towns and cities? 

Now if what Japan calls their rivalry, which stems from Japan trying to replace China as the status quo power in Asia during the Ming when they invaded Korea till they occupy much of China in WWII, then with that same fucking logic, I must then say the Chinese who held an intense hatred for Japan stemming from Japanese armies occupying China, burning Chinese cities and towns and villages, raped their way across the Chinese coast, butchered countless city including the Chinese capital Nanjing, would gladly welcome Japan taking a hostile position in the Chinese Civil War. 

&gt;Third, as alluded to above, China is far from immune from a blockade itself, and any belligerent would likely seize on China's dependency on oil imports from the Gulf and its food imports from everywhere as a way to retaliate in kind. There is also a risk of escalation as Taiwan, Korea and Japan view sea trade as a matter of existential threat. A bombardment of Chinese coastal infrastructure or, say, the Three Gorges Dam, at the same time as a counter-blockade could prove to be a devastating blow to the CCP's ability to maintain its rule.

So long as they became belligerent, anything within the rules of engagement is fair game. That said.

If someone bombs the Three Gorges which may result in millions of death then be prepared to be nuked. Don't be stupid. If you are targetting civilian infrastructure whose goal is to murder tens of millions of people, then you basically broke any kind of understanding and laws on war, and you deserved to be nuked. We will see whether the Chinese thinks the person who bombed the Three Gorges and killed tens of millions is at fault, or the CPC.",857ccfc11b92b4e75213dd6520f09020c8996edb,True,False,,,,,0,1649703338,,0,{},i4bsxny,False,t3_u0uyth,False,True,t1_i4a4x1w,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u0uyth/winning_the_fight_taiwan_cannot_afford_to_lose_a/i4bsxny/,1649703350,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649674538.0

Russia is nearing 50 days of war in Ukraine.

Here's the snapshot that U.S. is seeing, according to a senior U.S. defense official who briefed reporters today on day 46 of the war.

-----------
Russia's pace of missile launches has actually gone *DOWN* in recent days as the Kremlin has re-adjusted for operations in the Donbas. 

Weeks ago, 🇷🇺's average of missile launches per day was around 50. That number has sunk as we approach day 50.

NEW: Russia has launched more than 1,500 missiles into Ukraine in more than 46 days war of in Ukraine: senior U.S. defense official. 

Russia is focusing missile strikes in the Donbas. 🇷🇺 has fired an average of about 32 missiles a day in Ukraine.

Russia's new offensive in Donbas has yet to begin, U.S. officials caution. 

But 🇷🇺 has started reinforcing military positions southwest of Donetsk in an effort to prepare. And it is resupplying some units on the ground and moving others out of country.

NEW: Russia is sending an 8-mile long military convoy toward Ukraine's contested city of Izyum, south of Kharkiv, to ""reinforce and resupply"" troops in the Donbas: senior U.S. defense official. 

The convoy includes command &amp; control, a support battalion, enablers, &amp; rotary wing

Top Pentagon officials expect that Russia's campaign in the Donbas will be more of a close quarters fight – with mechanized forces nose-to-nose backed by artillery –  instead of shelling cities from distance, like the abortive drive on Kyiv.

NEW: Russia is adding more short-range units into Ukraine's Donbas region, including artillery and mechanized forces: senior U.S. defense official

Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley told Congress last week that the Donbas could see more mechanized combat.

That is dovetailing with the weapons systems that the US &amp; European nations want to supply to Ukraine.

Several nations are considering sending tanks to 🇺🇦 to take on Russian armor in the Donbas. And the US is looking for more options to train 🇺🇦 on drones

NEW: U.S. confirms that ""several nations"" are considering sending tanks to Ukraine: senior U.S. defense official.

The Czech Republic recently sent Soviet-era T-72 tanks &amp; BVP-1 infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine.

But Russia is still licking its wounds from the effort to take Kyiv. 

About 20 battalion tactical groups – maneuver units that form the backbone of Russia's military in 🇺🇦 – are regrouping in W 🇷🇺 &amp; Belarus. 

Another 20 BTGs are near Donbas.

NEW: Russia's northern grouping of forces in and around Ukraine's Donbas region includes 20 battalion tactical groups, slight more than half that are in 🇺🇦 right now: senior U.S. defense official 

🇷🇺 added 2 BTGs over the past few days in area  north of Luhansk &amp; east of Kharkiv

Russian units that could overcome Ukrainian forces in Sumy &amp; Chernihiv are out of the fight – and it's not clear whether they will return. 

And some others are likely done for good (other Western estimates indicate ~1/4 of Russian BTGs now inoperable).

&gt;How about France and Germany, or France and Italy? There is real distrust between some European nations that you wouldn't know about unless you spoke to their citizens instead of getting all your worldview from posts on reddit.

Since you're an American I will excuse you not knowing this, but one of the aims of the EU is to make repair these reams of mistrust. Programmes like open borders, student exchange (erasmus), European Parliament, etc. aren't some sneaky globalist NWO scheme to eliminate borders, but have a point to mend the relations of 27 bickering nations that completely destroyed their homes twice in less than 30 years.

And much to the fear of nationalists all over, the programme has largely *worked*. Millennial Europeans are identifying themselves as european as well as their nationality. They're more likely to have studied in another country than any of their ancestors. Beyond the occasional memes, nobody hates someone else based on what their grandparents did. I encourage you to visit Strasbourg and see how French and German citizens live peacefully side by side, or Monaco where every corrupt European lives peacefully side by side.

Supposedly some units and people are highly motivated by revenge, anger, or just Russian revanchism, and are more willing to commit war crimes because of several reasons (sometimes as simple as hatred for Ukrainians, and sometimes revenge for family members killed in the Donbass, whether Separatist military or civilian I do not know). Some units are much more moderate, and are much less likely to commit war crimes, sometimes they will even occupy a village or city, but actively assist in reconstruction if necessary or leave the residents to their own (peaceful of course) devices. Supposedly, one unit that is not war-crime inclined actually gave out corporal punishment and hard labor to their soldiers who were looting or pillaging, and I believe one Russian soldier was executed by his unit for murder of civilians, like a show trial.

""À court terme, la meilleure manière de leur faire retrouver au moins leur niveau antérieur est de les retirer de la zone des combats, de les mettre au repos et de les recompléter en hommes et en équipements. Il faut alors un temps de reconstitution proportionnel aux pertes. Une unité qui a perdu 30 % de pertes mettra trois fois plus de temps à se reconstituer qu’une unité qui en a subi 10 %. Pour un bataillon/groupement, il faut compter au minimum une semaine pour chaque tranche de 10 %. Notons qu’à l’issue le niveau tactique sera supérieur à celui du début de la guerre, par le simple effet d’expérience.""

Translation (Google because I dont have all day)

""In the short term, the best way to bring them back to at least their previous level is to remove them from the combat zone, put them to rest and replenish them in men and equipment. A recovery time proportional to the losses is then required. A unit that has lost 30% casualties will take three times longer to rebuild than a unit that has suffered 10%. For a battalion/group, it takes at least one week for each 10% increment. Note that at the end the tactical level will be higher than at the beginning of the war, by the simple effect of experience.""

This reminds me of a similar story also of an opening attack in WWII, that I read about on r/credibledefense. But this time by Japan against the United States, as opposed to France, as in your example. In this story of the behind the scenes of the plan to attack Pearl Harbor, a young officer develops a bold plan to deal a devastating blow against an adversary, but that plan is severely truncated by superiors and the reduced effort is only partially successful. This mirrors the young Manstein and his bold plan, but in this example the interference of the higher command proves fatal to strategic success. 

The potential of new technology was realized by a young and visionary officer, but their conservative superiors were wary of these new ideas and they limited the bold new plan, yet still accepted the concept and tried to perform it in a scenario with the highest possible stakes.

If you looked at the Global Firepower Index or searched online for strongest militaries, the exact rankings of #4-10 would vary a lot, but everyone could agree that the USA has the strongest military, Russia has the 2nd strongest military, and China has the 3rd strongest military. It seemed obvious that those were the strongest based on size and population and military spending and everybody else was distant by comparison.

Of course, Russia has invaded Ukraine recently and performed well below expectations despite Ukraine being far less powerful than Russia and bordering Russia. It is hard to believe that the world's 2nd strongest military would face all the struggles Russia has in this conflict.

But maybe Russia isn't the 2nd strongest military. I'd say there is now a very good argument that China and maybe even India would be an overall stronger military power than Russia is.

You'll get less downvotes that way and you can be upfront that there are a group of American political scientist calling themselves ""Realists"" who think NATO provoked Russia. That way, other redditors can say Mearsheimer is a paid Moscow troll (which he is accused of), but you can just say you're regurgitating him. 

Next, you need to recognize that he's full of shit. His specific theory aside, its his job to be full of shit. As someone with my own Pol Sci BA degree, let me be the first to say that political theorists are professionals bullshit artists. The only good use of a Pol Sci degree is it prepares one for law school better than most other bachelor's degrees, but that's about it. Otherwise, it has as much application to real life as a philosophy degree, which is essentially what Pol Sci is, being whimsical and philosophical about politics. And Mearsheimer has made a half century long career out of bullshitting. 

For instance, this is what he said publicly AFTER this war began:   


&gt;**\[Putin\] also saying that Ukraine is essentially a made-up nation, while he seems to be invading it, no?**  
  
O.K., but put those two things together and tell me what that means. I’m just not too sure. *He does believe it’s a made-up nation.* I would note to him, all nations are made up. Any student of nationalism can tell you that. We invent these concepts of national identity. They’re filled with all sorts of myths. *So he’s correct about Ukraine*, just like he’s correct about the United States or Germany. The much more important point is: he understands that he cannot conquer Ukraine and integrate it into a greater Russia or into a reincarnation of the former Soviet Union. He can’t do that. What he’s doing in Ukraine is fundamentally different. He is obviously lopping off some territory. He’s going to take some territory away from Ukraine, in addition to what happened with Crimea, in 2014. Furthermore, he is definitely interested in regime change. Beyond that, it’s hard to say exactly what this will all lead to, except for the fact that he is not going to conquer all of Ukraine. It would be a blunder of colossal proportions to try to do that.  
  
**I assume that you think if he were to try to do that, that would change your analysis of what we’ve witnessed.**  
  
Absolutely. My argument is that he’s not going to re-create the Soviet Union or try to build a greater Russia, that he’s not interested in conquering and integrating Ukraine into Russia. It’s very important to understand that we invented this story that Putin is highly aggressive and he’s principally responsible for this crisis in Ukraine. The argument that the foreign-policy establishment in the United States, and in the West more generally, has invented revolves around the claim that he is interested in creating a greater Russia or a reincarnation of the former Soviet Union. There are people who believe that when he is finished conquering Ukraine, he will turn to the Baltic states. He’s not going to turn to the Baltic states. First of all, the Baltic states are members of nato and—  
  
**Is that a good thing?**  
  
No.  
  
**You’re saying that he’s not going to invade them in part because they’re part of nato, but they shouldn’t be part of nato.**  
  
Yes, but those are two very different issues. I’m not sure why you’re connecting them. Whether I think they should be part of nato is independent of whether they are part of nato. They are part of nato. They have an Article 5 guarantee—that’s all that matters. Furthermore, he’s never shown any evidence that he’s interested in conquering the Baltic states. Indeed, he’s never shown any evidence that he’s interested in conquering Ukraine.  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/why-john-mearsheimer-blames-the-us-for-the-crisis-in-ukraine](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/why-john-mearsheimer-blames-the-us-for-the-crisis-in-ukraine) 

So this professional bullshit artist acknowledges that Putin aspires to recreate the Soviet Union, which means bringing in all those breakaway republics (like Ukraine) back into the fold. He acknowledges Putin's argument that Ukraine ""isn't real"" but then has the balls to blame NATO for Russia wanting it back, despite acknowledging Putin wants it back. He says Russia doesn't want to conquer Ukraine, but then describes how they want a regime change which effectively turns Ukraine into a Russian proxy state. 

So let's break this down from a non-Realist full of shit view: 

After having dealt with Russia as the leading republic of the Soviet Union and before that as czarist Russia, the collapse of the Soviet Union gave a bunch of small countries bordering Russia the opportunity to never again to be part of Russia, which many of them love the idea of, because they got treated like shit while being under Russia. However, because Russia is big and powerful compared to those smaller states, they have no way alone to stop Russia from outright conquering them or placing them back firmly in their sphere of influence through a ""regime change."" 

The only way to survive is to form a military alliance, but the Baltic-Ukraine-Georgian alliance has no teeth, because they're all small states who even together can't do shit. But oh wait, there just so happens to be a massive and mighty military alliance that already exists whose entire purpose was containing Russian expansion westward. Why wouldn't these small ex-Soviet/Russian states want to be part of NATO? And why would NATO want to turn them away? 

Mearsheimer's Mexico analogy doesn't make sense at all, because the US never controlled Mexico. Instead, flip that around: Imagine Spain trying to regain control of Mexico and everything else because they want to rebuild their empire. And imagine if Mexico et al tried to stop that by forming a military alliance led by the US. And imagine if Spain invaded Mexico to try to stop them from joining said alliance. America would not be responsible for starting that war, unless one simply chooses to only acknowledge the point of view of Spain. 

And that is what Mearsheimer specializes in: he promotes the point of views of antagonistic govts. Its one thing to say ""Here is how they think, because I took the time to learn how they think."" Its quite another to say ""They're right in how they think and the US is wrong."" That just makes him either Devil's Advocate for the sake of provocation so he can fill classrooms and sell books, or else it makes him a traitor (legitimately, that's what the word really does mean).",71f8f32410d5beb9a7c56a4e64513c99e6b1e942,True,False,,,,,0,1649696055,,0,{},i4bceij,False,t3_u18fq1,False,False,t1_i4apkcv,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u18fq1/general_questions_megathread_weekly_april_11th/i4bceij/,1649696067,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649667255.0

[],False,,to_change,,,[],,,,text,t2_1pyv5bw5,False,False,"Two facts about the lead-up to the Battle of France in 1940 are well-noted by historians.      

1. Many note that the ideas that would come to be known as ""Blitzkrieg"" by the popular press were not actually that new, and actually trace their roots back to von Moltke the Elder's ideas in the 1860s/70s. Notably, German doctrine already contained elements of the following ideas:

1. Winning decisive battles against the enemy in short campaigns.
2. Achieving that victory through rapid operational maneuver (Bewegungskrieg), potentially creating an encirclement (Kesselschlacht)
3. Penetrating enemy defensive lines in one area through concentration of force (Schwerpunkt).   
For example, in his history of German Tank Doctrine, u/The_Chieftain_WG noted that Hans von Seekt, in the immediate aftermath of WW1, focused on the relatively mobile war in the East to reaffirm the principles of German doctrine going back to the 1870s.  Moreover, on the specific use of armor, many in the army (not just Heinz Guderian, but also folks like Beck and Lutz) were clamoring for the creation and use of armored divisions and corps-level formations in independent maneuver operations. 

2.  Despite this, there was considerable resistance, particularly in the Fall / Winter of 1939, to what has come to be known as the ""Manstein Plan"", the idea to mass an armored corps, march it through the Ardennes Forest, cross the Meuse river, and push to the channel coast to encircle the Allied armies pushing into Belgium. Evidence to this point is beautifully summarized by The Blitzkrieg Legend, which notes that Halder (OKH Chief of Staff) had Manstein removed from his post as the CoS of Army Group A, that even when the plan had been accepted, they subordinated Panzer Group Kliest to Army Group A and made sure that von Kliest, a ""very conservative"" general was given command of the Panzer Group.  

&amp;#x200B;

Therein lies my cognitive dissonance and question. It seems as if the Manstein plan, with it's focus on a concentrated Schwerpunkt, a decisive operational encirclement achieved via fast-moving armored formations, was 100% consistent with existing Wermacht doctrine, and thus, assuming that doctrine was well known and well-practiced by OKH, should have found favor with them.

[],False,,jrex035,,,[],,,,text,t2_2k929ak,False,False,"&gt;To what extent is Ukrainian OPSEC is affecting our view of the conflict?

Significantly. There is a LOT more video evidence/reports of Russian acitivty and losses than Ukrainian. This is due to better OPSEC and also because Ukrainians are less likely to upload evidence of their losses. That said, Ukrainian losses have to be high it's just a question of how high and if they're suffering more or less than Russian forces (I think less, but likely not that much better).

&gt;Over the last few weeks, far fewer videos of the Ukrainian Air Force and of Bayraktar strikes have been coming out.

A few things. First, OSINT is really bad at covering the air war as it's hard to record planes flying at high altitudes and high speeds, hard to actually find downed aircraft (compared to say burned out tanks in the middle of town), and few if any civilians would see Ukrainian aircraft destroyed on the ground at airbases. Second, all of the TB2 recordings we've seen have been leaked, not released. This is likely at the behest of Turkey who is trying to walk a fine line in its relationship with Russia (they haven't closed airspace or imposed sanctions, but are supplying military equipment to Ukraine). 

My own personal guess is that Ukrainian fixed wing aircraft have taken considerable losses, but are being held in reserve for now to preserve them for a critical battle (say in the Donbas). Only 3 TB2s have been confirmed downed out of an estimated 36, so I imagine they're still operating and doing damage, though it's possible/likely they're being held back for use at a crucial moment like other Ukrainian aircraft and equipment. It should also be noted that there have been just a handful of advanced Ukrainian tanks (T-64BM1, T-64BM2, T-84s, T-72s, etc) meaning it's likely these are being held in reserve for a major counter offensive.",66e63286fc6850be54a27497e1793489ed3e3861,True,False,,,,,0,1649689488,,0,{},i4avtvm,False,t3_u163bl,False,True,t1_i4ar3i0,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u163bl/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_11_2022/i4avtvm/,1649689500,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649660688.0

Also, Russia just finally appointed a single theater commander for this war.

Foreign military cooperation between Ukraine and the West and most importantly the United States was increasing and Russia understands that it doesn't have the conventional means to defend its western flank.

When you look at history, you start to understand why Russia is so worried about its western flank. Look at WW2 and most importantly look now at the strongest military alliance in the history of the world which considers Russia its arch-enemy.

If Russia was attempting to form a ""defensive"" alliance with Mexico, would the US stand for it?

Look, I am not happy that Russia invaded Ukraine and I hope the war ends as soon as possible but Russia is going to defend its strategic interests just as any country with the capability would. The United States attacked Iraq, which is half a world away in the name of national security. Later the reasons were all found to be lies though. Foreign militaries were training Ukrainians both in and outside of Ukraine and providing military support.

If you anyone is interested, please look for the declassified American paper titled something like ""The Soviet War Scare."" In the 1980s, high ranking Soviet military and intelligence officials really thought that the United States was seeking a preemptive strike because it was beginning to have major military and strategic superiority.

Look, I am not saying Russia is right but I am absolutely disgusted by people not taking Russia's security into account. Go read about the history of NATO expansion, especially in 2008. Russia had already proven it would go to war to keep Georgia away from the West.

I see people online saying that Ukraine should be armed to the teeth. Okay, what do they care about? Do they want peace? That's not the way to peace. Because if Russia is really defeated, I don't think they will leave Ukraine alone. The possibility of nuclear war is large, I think.

Please read ""Why the Ukraine Crisis is the West's fault."" I am not saying Russia is correct in this crisis but I am saying that if you fail to take Russia's security into consideration, you will get more of the war everyone is so outraged about.

    For GBSD (The Sentinel), are they building new silos? Or just re-using the old minuteman ones?
    Would silos be upgraded with new technology? As I understand it the current ones work on 60s/70s technology.
    Would the US return to using MIRVs on the GBSD? I couldn't see an answer either way, but given the expiration of START treaties, and Russia's nuclear expansion, I suppose it would make sense to go back to MIRV.
    Would the US keep the current Minuteman numbers? Or increase/decrease?

Is there a good overall resource on US planning? For instance:

    Would the US Consider re-deploying TLAM-Ns on Destroyers/SSNs?
    How is the bomber force going to be structured? With the B-21 doing conventional attack and nuclear missions, do they keep a portion of the force on nuclear alert and the other portion is free for conventional?
    For Tactical Nukes, would CVNs see a return to deploying these as well? Right now it seems most of the B-61s are in Europe and CONUS.

Granted, I know much of this is secret, but given the expansion of the Chinese nuclear posture (more land-based silos, etc.) and the Russian recap of their forces, I'm genuinely curious as to how the US will approach these updates.",bf9a578146a41e3b4f790b3d0e60934a4d77b86a,True,False,,,,,0,1649688624,,0,{},i4atozu,False,t3_u18fq1,False,True,t3_u18fq1,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u18fq1/general_questions_megathread_weekly_april_11th/i4atozu/,1649688642,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649659824.0

To what extent is Ukrainian OPSEC is affecting our view of the conflict?

Over the last few weeks, far fewer videos of the Ukrainian Air Force and of Bayraktar strikes have been coming out. We haven't seen any evidence of fixed-wing sorties since the first days of the war, although given the Belgorod strike  it seems likely they can still field helicopters. It's without doubt that UA has taken heavy losses, and that due to their social media stance it's easier to see Russian losses than Ukrainian losses in personnel and materiel alike. However, how much of this may be due to tightening OPSEC? Earlier there were some Russian strikes on UA assets attributed to social media posts. Proportionally, it seems like a lot more of the Ukrainian videos over the last couple weeks are coming from volunteer groups like Azof or the TDF rather than the regulars. Is some of this perception just a tighter hold on OPSEC?

[],False,,Comfortable_Sand7034,,,[],,,,text,t2_jwditdt5,False,False,"In my opinion, the war in Ukraine is the fault of the United States and Ukraine itself.

Foreign military cooperation between Ukraine and the West and most importantly the United States was increasing and Russia understands that it doesn't have the conventional means to defend its western flank.

When you look at history, you start to understand why Russia is so worried about its western flank. Look at WW2 and most importantly look now at the strongest military alliance in the history of the world which considers Russia its arch-enemy.

If Russia was attempting to form a ""defensive"" alliance with Mexico, would the US stand for it?

Look, I am not happy that Russia invaded Ukraine and I hope the war ends as soon as possible but Russia is going to defend its strategic interests just as any country with the capability would. The United States attacked Iraq, which is half a world away in the name of national security. Later the reasons were all found to be lies though. Foreign militaries were training Ukrainians both in and outside of Ukraine and providing military support.

If you anyone is interested, please look for the declassified American paper titled something like ""The Soviet War Scare."" In the 1980s, high ranking Soviet military and intelligence officials really thought that the United States was seeking a preemptive strike because it was beginning to have major military and strategic superiority.

Look, I am not saying Russia is right but I am absolutely disgusted by people not taking Russia's security into account. Go read about the history of NATO expansion, especially in 2008. Russia had already proven it would go to war to keep Georgia away from the West.

I see people online saying that Ukraine should be armed to the teeth. Okay, what do they care about? Do they want peace? That's not the way to peace. Because if Russia is really defeated, I don't think they will leave Ukraine alone. The possibility of nuclear war is large, I think.

Please read ""Why the Ukraine Crisis is the West's fault."" I am not saying Russia is correct in this crisis but I am saying that if you fail to take Russia's security into consideration, you will get more of the war everyone is so outraged about.

If anyone wants to discuss, let's have a polite discussion.

&gt; A special episode of AT THE BRINK

&gt; In the 90s, Ukraine made the decision to dismantle the thousands of former Soviet nuclear weapons left on its territory. Nearly 3 decades later, Russia has invaded Ukraine using its own nuclear arsenal to bully other nations from interceding. In this special episode of AT THE BRINK, we explore whether Ukrainian denuclearization was a fateful mistake and if a nuclear Ukraine could have prevented the Russian invasion.

We will never know about the actual fringe of opinion that agrees with that. The Russian-American politologist Gary Shteyngart, that left the RF recently, told during a meeting in Paris that even the independent Russian opinion surveys can’t be taken for a fact. Their survey process is intrinsically biaised : 
1. Lea call people on the landline phone so people are afraid to express their disagreements with the government because they always suspect the survey is a desguised enquiry to find the “traitors”. And as now protesting against this war and even calling it “war” is punished with 15 years of emprisonnent, it’s quite a risk. Especially if you know what Russian prisons are like (in a recent documentary they massively torture the prisoners by putting immersive boilers in their anal conducts and keeping them switched on until the anal conduct of the person is destroyed and the person is dead or passed out).  [link to documentary](https://youtu.be/WNi4HUotozc)

2. Survey workers call people between 7 and 8 o’clock in the evening when people are usually in front of the TV watching the news program. They ask the people questions such as “do you support of your government?” while news broadcast says  Ukrainians are killing their own folk…

3. they ask them framed questions so people don’t really answer about their agreement with the war but their agreement with what is depicted in the news and of the analyse the whole context. 

4. Most people who didn’t agree with this government already left the country. By now 1/3 of the Russian intellectual elite has left. And some people that left still have family there, so they are even afraid of expressing their protest abroad as their fear negative repercussions against their family in Russia.",677f59170d7bc5d722a8b124ebfdb68dba1b2caa,True,False,,,,,0,1649676934,,0,{},i4a53kx,False,t3_tyfct0,False,True,t1_i49sorr,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tyfct0/bill_clinton_why_i_expanded_nato/i4a53kx/,1649676948,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649648134.0
[],False,,CaptainSluggo,,,[],,,,text,t2_ei9xllvr,False,False,"First, a blockade is irrefutably an act of war. The modern observer's perception of blockades is muddled by the frequency and ineffective nature of embargoes during the Cold War and beyond. An embargo differs from a blockade in that an embargo prevents trade of the enemy nation with you, while a blockade prevents trade with everyone. The US, by its outsized trade footprint, has embargoed several states in a way which may resemble a blockade, but is not an overt act of war because you can't make me trade with you. China has actually implemented a partial embargo on Taiwan in the past few years, by limiting the import of certain Taiwanese goods, the most famous example being pineapples, which prompted a global surge in demand for Taiwanese pineapple that actually increased its export sales. An actual blockade would imply China stopping and potentially seizing neutral shipping, including American shipping.

This would mean that, for a partial war effort which would not instantly bring Taiwan to its knees, China would suffer all the diplomatic setbacks a regular war would entail. Worse than that, the right of American merchants to go anywhere and sell anything around the world has always been policy and casus belli for the Americans. During WWI, America's eventual declaration of war on Germany was directly caused by German Unrestricted Submarine Warfare which killed Americans and impacted American sale of both war contraband and regular goods across the Atlantic. In WWII, the Lend-Lease program was another demonstration of America's commitment to trade as both a tool and a goal of war. And at the very beginning of the Cold War, the American-led Berlin Air Lift was a weighted response to Soviet attempts at blockading West Berlin, as well as a potent demonstration of Allied logistics capability. In the case of a blockade on Taiwan, the President of the United States would have all the moral and historical justification to call China's bluff by sending supplies to Taiwan, forcing China into a zugzwang where they must take the loss, or fire on American ships and risk bringing America into the war.

Second, it is no good just saying you blockading a nation (""I didn't say it, I declared it!""), You must also enforce it. The waters around Taiwan are one of the most busy areas for maritime traffic. Lots of ships, not just those bound for Taiwan, traverse the Straits. Crucial imports and exports for Japan, South Korea and even China itself would be at risk, and all three are net food and energy importers with an outsized export footprint, just like Taiwan. This means you can't just shoot at any ship in the area like the Germans did in the Atlantic, you must patrol, intercept, board and potentially seize merchant ships, a logistically challenging undertaking even if China had complete naval dominance in the area, which it does not. The chance of misunderstanding with a Japanese or Korean ship spiralling out of control into a declaration of war border on the inevitable, even if Japan was a fully complicit partner instead of having a superior deep ocean navy and an intense hatred for China stemming from eight centuries of political rivalry.

Third, as alluded to above, China is far from immune from a blockade itself, and any belligerent would likely seize on China's dependency on oil imports from the Gulf and its food imports from everywhere as a way to retaliate in kind. There is also a risk of escalation as Taiwan, Korea and Japan view sea trade as a matter of existential threat. A bombardment of Chinese coastal infrastructure or, say, the Three Gorges Dam, at the same time as a counter-blockade could prove to be a devastating blow to the CCP's ability to maintain its rule.

In the words of the French ambassador to Britain on the eve of the Great War, no country wages war by halves. A blockade would be maximum diplomatic risk in exchange for a slow and uncertain path to victory for China. While a blockade is certainly a part of any war plan against Taiwan, relying on it solely would be exactly the wrong strategy to employ. China needs a lightning fast fait accompli before any other military can intervene, and before Taiwan itself can mount sufficient resistance. A blockade gives all of the initiative to China's enemies.",3e4d2a95013e84a1dde04a19814abe7d12cf3161,True,False,,,,,0,1649676825,,0,{},i4a4x1w,False,t3_u0uyth,False,True,t1_i49pizd,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u0uyth/winning_the_fight_taiwan_cannot_afford_to_lose_a/i4a4x1w/,1649676838,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649648025.0

It's clear that there isn't enough time to train the crews. Western tank crews train somewhere between three and five months before becoming qualified on their vehicles. However, some of that training will be non-specific to that exact vehicle type and it's possible that experienced Ukrainian tank crews could get up to speed a lot faster if they were to be trained trained on western MBTs. Considering the urgency of the situation, I also imagine the training would be less rigorous. On the other hand, it's quite possible the language barrier would slow down things enough to offset those time saves.

The other, maybe bigger question is: does any major western power have the political will to send such arms? The US has thousands of Abrams and they could send more than Ukraine could realistically use without any impact on their own capabilities, but the logistical requirements (JP-8) make it less likely (I've read that Australian Abrams use diesel?). Furthermore the US might be worried about the optics of such a transfer. Germany still appear to be sitting on their hands when it comes to weapons transfers, and they hardly have any Leopard 2s in working condition anyway. France similarly hasn't been as public about its lethal aid as many other countries, and there is some degree of political uncertainty with the presidential elections currently being held.

The only country that I see possibly doing a transfer is the UK, but the UK only has some 200 Challenger 2s, meaning they couldn't send that many even if they wanted to. All in all, it seems quite unlikely, but if plans for this had been set in motion even a month ago, when we already had clear indications of the northern front stalling, maybe tanks could enter Ukrainian service in time to make a difference.",5064a8ffa19b5c3879dabb82efa8b6955dd2b527,True,False,,,,,0,1649669945,,0,{},i49vbyf,False,t3_u0g54m,False,True,t3_u0g54m,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u0g54m/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_10_2022/i49vbyf/,1649669962,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649641145.0

But I also share your confusion. We saw Russia get turned back at Mykolaiv in what appeared to be a non-urban open front for them to maneuver. Not only did they lose the initiative in Mykolaiv and Kryvyi Rih, they were mauled by a largely partisan force at Voznesenk. I have no doubt they will be able to push in some direction, but the idea of them covering the 125 km between Izium and Pavlohrad does seems unreasonably optimistic. 

Further, in the north we say them successfully take a lot of ground early in the war because UA forces were not dug in. Even in smaller towns like Konotop and Nizhyn, the Russians choose not to engage but to bypass and never actually entered the towns. A huge reason why the Chernihiv and Sumy fronts collapsed is because the bypassed UA forces just started tearing up supply lines.

Attacking south from Izyum they need to cover 40km to Slavyansk, which will be heavily defended. Attacking southwest it's 35 km to Barvinkove and then they are going to hit another urban pocket. Attacking due west there aren't any urban areas on the road, but that also doesn't help the Russians to drive on Dnipro or encircle the JFO. And preferably they need to do either of those things quickly, because if the JFO is able to withdraw from Sieverodonesk and avoid being surrounded, Putin may take the land but he's just extended his supply lines without harming the UA.

Maybe we'll all be posting here in two weeks guessing at how we missed the Russian Phase 2 Blitz success across the entire east of the country. Maybe the UA is in much worse shape than we think and they can no longer wage an active defense the way they did in March. But beyond Russia's poor supply line and morale issues, the other story of their unpreparedness to fight in urban areas. Chernihiv, Sumy, and Kharkiv all held out. The Kyiv suburbs alone held out, both east and west. For god's sake, Mariupol has been surrounded since February 28th and the UA there is still chewing through Russian formations. Is Russia really capable of the operation people think they are planning?

Even if the best case scenario for Russia, where are they in a month's time if they can't operate significantly better? Engaged on a line from Zapo-Pavlohrad-Kharkiv having taken most of the east at what cost? 40k-50k dead and 100k+ total casualties? It just seems like any situation in which they do not achieve some kind of crushing blow against the UA results in them doubling down on the most unsustainable parts of this war.",354667a341e6fe1eb6fb1fdfb24c387b3d2123ae,True,False,,,,,0,1649653680,,0,{},i49af9x,False,t3_u0g54m,False,True,t1_i48zkjb,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u0g54m/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_10_2022/i49af9x/,1649653698,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649624880.0

Rob Lee gave his thoughts on the article on twitter:

A good article by Yaroslav. Narrowing its focus on the Donbas with fewer large cities will play into the Russian military's strengths, but Ukraine can also afford to retreat to hold more defensible areas. The main objective for Ukraine is to not allow its forces to be encircled.

Ukraine doesn't have to let Russia dictate the direction of the fight. It can attack Russian forces in Kherson, northern Kharkiv, and even conduct attacks along the northeastern Ukrainian border with Russia to stretch Russian forces. 2/

I think Russia will likely achieve some tactical, possibly operational, successes and extend its control over the Donbas, but as long as Ukraine doesn't allow Russia to cut off a substantial share of its forces, I doubt Russia can achieve significant strategic gains. 3/

I also suspect Ukraine has held back much of its TB2 and aviation for this scenario, and it can obviously reinforce positions more quickly from Kyiv and other regions. The question is whether Russia extending control over more of SE Ukraine is sufficient for Moscow's war aims. 4/

Of course, Russia runs the risk of attriting even more of its ground forces to achieve questionable strategic goals, and these forces can't be easily replaced by conscripts. There is also no guarantee that Russia will be able to attain a workable long-term solution in SE Ukraine.",bdc2f1fa640b956e0288c7405571c11027d3eadc,True,False,,,,,0,1649643783,,0,{},i48sj10,False,t3_u0g54m,False,True,t1_i48rn54,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u0g54m/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_10_2022/i48sj10/,1649643799,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649614983.0

[],False,,MarshalWillKane,,,[],,,,text,t2_dla6h,False,False,"The tactical situation is more advantageous for Russia on the Donbas front. Russian supply lines are shorter, and the more concentrated area of operations allows Russia to more effectively use air support, Ukrainian and Western military officials said.

This different type of warfare, with large formations facing each other instead of small-unit strikes, is a major reason why Kyiv says it urgently needs heavy weapons, such as artillery, tanks and antiaircraft batteries that most Western allies have been reluctant to supply so far.

“The battle for Donbas will remind you of the Second World War, with its large operations and maneuvers, the involvement of thousands of tanks, armored vehicles, planes and artillery. And this will not be a local operation, based on what we see in Russia’s preparations,"" Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said after meeting North Atlantic Treaty Organization ministers this past week. “Either you help us now—and I’m speaking days, not weeks—or your help will come too late and many people will die.""

While Ukraine initially sought Soviet-designed heavy weapons systems that its troops are trained to use, the limited supply of this equipment and ammunition, combined with the prospect of a lengthy conflict, mean that Kyiv is now requesting purchases of NATO-standard heavy weapons, Ukraine’s Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said.

“The Soviet-made weapons that we have obtained can only strengthen Ukraine for a short time,"" he said in a speech posted by the Ministry of Defense.

Ukraine managed to win the first round of the war because of close-contact infantry engagements, he said, but now Russia has changed its tactics and is relying more on long-range artillery, aviation and missile strikes—weapons that Ukraine has limited ability to counter.

“The war is entering the phase of competition for resources, which are almost unlimited in Russia in comparison to Ukraine,"" Mr. Reznikov said. “To win in this war, we need a different kind of assistance from what we received before.""

Western leaders are stepping up support. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who Saturday took a walk around Kyiv with Mr. Zelensky, announced new military and other assistance that includes 120 armored vehicles and new antiship missile systems. That is on top of Friday’s package of Starstreak short-range antiaircraft missiles, 800 more antitank missiles and high-tech munitions that loiter above targets for precision strikes.

“This war will be won on the battlefield,"" European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell tweeted on Saturday. He traveled to Kyiv on Friday, along with the head of the European Commission, which afterward said the EU is proposing 500 million euros, equivalent to $544 million, in new support for Ukraine’s military, on top of 1 billion euros previously allocated for weapons

The U.S. announced $400 million in additional military aid to Ukraine in April, out of a total of $1.4 billion since the war started Feb. 24. Washington is supplying Javelins, Stinger missiles, hundreds of Switchblade loitering drones, and counter-artillery radars—but, so far, no heavy weapons requested by Kyiv.

So far, only the Czech Republic has supplied Ukraine with tanks, sending Soviet-designed T72Ms, while Slovakia shipped to Ukraine its S-300 air-defense system after the deployment of Patriot batteries to replace it.

Before Russia’s full-scale invasion began in February, Ukraine controlled about two-thirds of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions that comprise Donbas. The rest were governed by the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics, statelets created following Russia’s intervention in 2014, when Moscow also annexed Crimea from Ukraine.

Russian President Vladimir Putin in February recognized these statelets in their claimed borders that cover the entirety of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, including the cities of Kramatorsk, Slovyansk and Severodonetsk that remain under Ukrainian control.

Ukrainian officials said Moscow’s aims likely go far beyond seizing these areas, and that Mr. Putin seeks to destroy the best Ukrainian units in the battle of Donbas to then try again to seize the rest of the country, including Kyiv.

Unlike in the northern regions of Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy, where support for Ukraine’s independence from Russia has long run high, Moscow can count on at least some cooperation from locals in Donbas and nearby areas of eastern and southern Ukraine, where some part of the population is sympathetic to Russia. In the Luhansk region, four city mayors have already switched sides and begun collaborating with the Russian military, including the mayor of the front-line city of Rubizhne, according to the regional administration.

In besieged Mariupol, where fierce Ukrainian resistance continues in parts of the city, tying up a large Russian force, a member of the city council from a pro-Russian political party has assumed mayor’s duties under the auspices of Russian occupation forces, according to his appearances on Russian TV. Ukraine said it has begun treason proceedings against him.

At least 5,000 people, and possibly many more, have died in Mariupol under Russian shelling and bombing, according to the city’s elected mayor. Russian state media usually blame the destruction there, and elsewhere in Ukraine, on Ukrainian “Nazis"" who allegedly shell their own cities to incriminate Moscow.

In an unusually frank admission, Aleksandr Sladkov, Russian state television’s military commentator, wrote in a social-media post that Mariupol is being leveled to present an example to the rest of Ukraine.

“Let them see in Kyiv and Lviv, Cherkasy and Poltava, Ternopil and Chernivtsi—if the city doesn’t surrender, it gets annihilated,"" he wrote. “The cities of central and western Ukraine will also be destroyed if they decide to resist Russian troops.""

Ukraine, Russia gear up for war’s biggest battles. Yaroslav Trofimov, The Wall Street Journal
Officials expect large-scale tank and artillery battles; it ‘will remind you of the Second World War,’ says Ukraine’s foreign minister

Ukraine and Russia poured reinforcements into eastern Ukraine this weekend, preparing for what is likely to become the war’s biggest battles as refugees continued to flee the looming Russian assault.

Russia’s main objective now is to seize the parts of the eastern Donbas region not yet controlled by Moscow. Unlike the first phase of the six-week-old conflict, that shift is forcing Ukraine into fighting conventional battles involving tanks, artillery and aircraft on flat, often barren terrain that allows Russia to leverage its superiority in military equipment.

Fresh Russian tank and artillery units, as well as forces withdrawn from areas around Kyiv, began arriving in recent days to staging grounds for the offensive north of the Ukrainian city of Izyum, according to footage shown on Russian military television. Ukraine, too, started moving toward Donbas combat units from areas of northern Ukraine that it recovered after Russian troops retreated.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for urgent assistance ahead of this new round of the conflict, warning that Moscow hasn’t given up on its aspirations to subjugate Ukraine. “Russia can still afford to live in illusions, gathering new armor and new troops on our soil. And that means that we need even more sanctions, and even more weapons for our state,"" he said in a late Saturday video address.

Attempting to disrupt the Ukrainian redeployment, Russia has said that its forces carried out a series of airstrikes on Ukrainian railway hubs. Some 52 people died in Friday’s Russian missile attack on the railway station in the Donbas city of Kramatorsk just as it was packed with civilians trying to board evacuation trains toward the relative safety of western Ukraine, according to Ukrainian authorities. Moscow denied it carried out that particular strike.

Authorities over the weekend urged all civilians in Ukrainian-controlled parts of Donetsk and Luhansk regions—which comprise Donbas—and two districts of the Kharkiv region to use all available means to leave immediately. They organized additional trains and buses.

Russia launched several additional missile strikes on the Dnipropetrovsk region just west of Donbas on Sunday, destroying an infrastructure facility in the city of Dnipro and an industrial facility in the city of Pavlohrad, the regional administration said. Ukrainian forces overnight destroyed a Russian column that was moving toward Izyum, according to the governor of Kharkiv. The claim couldn't be independently verified.

Russia’s Defense Ministry said it targeted Dnipro with Kalibr missiles from a Black Sea fleet frigate and that its missiles also struck the southern Ukrainian region of Mykolayiv and a military airfield near Kharkiv, where it said it destroyed an S-300 antiaircraft missile system. Those claims couldn't be confirmed independently. Dnipro—one of Ukraine’s biggest cities—is the logistical hub for Ukrainian military operations in Donbas.

Russia’s initial attempt to seize Kyiv and other cities in northern Ukraine collapsed in late March, in part because nimble Ukrainian units attacked Russian tanks and armored vehicles using guerrilla tactics, striking at Russia’s long supply lines that ran through woods and villages whose residents relayed intelligence to Ukrainian forces.

I enjoyed it immensely and encourage others to make the time to read it. 

This was published in November of 2021, so just a few months ago. But as we are now in day 45 of a major war that has enormous lessons learned, it feels like an eternity ago. The article discusses potential problems with manpower and that Taiwan was considering to set up a Territorial Force like what Ukraine has done with great success. I bet these efforts have been increased recently, and recruiting efforts have been boosted considerably. 

There are many other similarities to Ukraine with the threat of conventional ballistic missiles being ever present and the only defense being actively shifting assets around. If you have been following the developments of that war then you see many of the same lessons spelled out here in this article. 

The changes mentioned in the article and the arguments for them makes is something that the US has been pushing for a while. Which is strange because it is essentially an argument to make more of its domestic weaponry and to buy billions of dollars less in equipment from the US. This reminds me of the article with the author dissuading South Korea to procuring nuclear attack submarines. With the purchases of premier weapon systems being pursued for their prestige but no their efficacy in deterrence.

Key Points

* Taiwan has begun to embrace a new asymmetric defense approach focused on fighting in the littoral with smaller, more survivable systems. This is key to defeating a Chinese invasion.
* Support from President Tsai Ingwen has been high but there is resistance from some senior members of Taiwan’s defense establishment who favor more expensive conventional systems.
* Personnel recruitment and logistics are two key elements that the Overall Defense Concept and Taiwan’s defense strategy need to address.
* The United States should not only provide critical defense items to Taiwan but also help Taipei refine its new defense strategy and improve interoperability between U.S. and Taiwan armed forces.

There seems to be some disagreement in the German government coalition on how to proceed and what weapons to deliver. Ukraine and Russia likely exert pressure as well.

[],False,,poincares_cook,,,[],,,,text,t2_uea8mi,False,False,"&gt;The issue is Russia needs replacements ASAP. Even two-three months from now is too long.

While I agree that the units are needed ASAP, I believe there is a good chance that hostilities won't end in 2-3 months, and that's the crux of it.

Additionally, I believe that specifically backfilling existing units with troops that were released within the last year, or have been training regularly (3-4 weeks a year of serious training, not sure how the Russian system works and if there are any such), can be done on a much faster time table than 2-3 months. This also depends on the casualties a unit has suffered. backfilling 10% is radically different than backfilling 25-30%, not all units were mauled to the same degree.

Similarly, forming units and sending them to say Armenia, Tajikistan some far away Russian border or even in the extreme guarding the Ukrainian-Russian border between Sumi and Cherniyev, or going to hold the occupation in Melitopol can be used with lower grade units, drawn up from these reserves, with shorter training. Then use the time stationed in a 'safe area' for continuous training (less applicable to units in Melitopol).

&gt;And what about NCOs and officers? Those always make up a sizeable number of overall casualties, and even less of them are reservists.

Yes, I absolutely agree on this point, but again since they are currently drawing just 60k out of what I've seen reported as 900k reserves, they can pick and choose emphasis now, with the cost of having worse forces to draw from in the future. This can also be partially solved by sending the units to replace other whole ones. This has it's own costs.

Bottom line is that Russia isn't in a great condition to do anything instantly, they should have started drawing reserves and training them up the day they invaded, or at worse, the day the overwhelming western reaction has become obvious. But that doesn't mean that drawing reserves now will do nothing to improve their situation or give them more options.",fa497ff31fb4157495f0b5cd66eed8da7d9cf575,True,False,,,,,0,1649637425,,0,{},i48f1g4,False,t3_tz1x8g,False,True,t1_i41fi5i,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tz1x8g/ukraine_conflict_megathread/i48f1g4/,1649637442,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649608625.0

While I never operated an IFV, training sounds like an excuse to some extent, Ukraine is experienced with operating IFV's. The Marder doesn't have any dramatically different capabilities than the ones Ukraine already operates. If manuals need translating so be it. After all it's just a tracked vehicle with a mounted manually operated gun iirc. Sure some training is required but nothing to take months and this war isn't going to end in a week. There's some more complex training needed for maintenance, but again, Ukraine has experience maintaining tracked vehicles, this isn't something too radical.

Logistic concerns are imo more real, special ammo, special parts, etc. But that can be used as an excuse against delivering **any** weapon system that Ukraine does not currently posses including German artillery. Artillery is far more demanding on logistics than an IFV in general. 

&gt;The statement of the German government was pretty much: “Take this money and buy what you want from German arms manufacturers.”

Yeah, I know. But in practice seems like not much is allowed to be bought. They did get Metadors. See:
