There are a lot of people who think capitalism just functions on its own. It does not.  Capitalism functions to seek efficiency only where the efficient market assumptions are near to being true.  Among others those are: information widely available, comparing products is easy, huge numbers of buyers and sellers competing, and negative or neutral returns to scale.

Where these are not the case, (for example in telecommunications where there is positive returns to scale) regulation is the only way to ensure efficiency or you end up in monopoly or other broken market types.

But really this all goes back to the liberal imperialists in the Clinton administration who were pushing for NATO enlargement in the 90s. Way back in 1995, Michael Mandelbaum wrote a very prophetic piece called ""Preserving the New Peace: The Case against NATO Expansion"" which made clear that the outcome of this would be conflict with Russia over Ukraine. The neocons of the Bush administration simply continued the process started by their predecessors.  
  
What I'm curious about is how would this have played out if the US hadn't become more isolationist as a result of the failed interventions in MENA? Would we be seeing a no-fly zone in Ukraine like in Yugoslavia in the 90s? Would NATO troops be sent into the country?  
  
As for domestic politics, I think the Democrats have come to the conclusion that in order for them to meet their objectives they must employ the same tactics that the Republicans used against them over the last 30-odd years.  The failure of the Obama era and the loss in 2016 was perhaps the last thing holding them to some of their principles and now you see them engaging in the same aggressive gerrymandering as the Republicans in states like New York as well as the constant attacks during Trump's term which were probably seen as a response to the attacks on Hillary's emails, the Obama birther movement, republican attacks on Obamacare and possibly even the impeachment of Clinton.   
  
Bringing foreign policy into domestic political battles I think shows the short-sightedness of this approach. Both sides are hurting the US' long-term strategic interests for short-term political gains by punishing any 'weakness' in the other side towards 'bad actors' like Iran, Cuba, North Korea and Russia, so the end result is constant escalation with no possible resolution.",60b1f27aaa92d2c785dc0a5a80f42af7fa274c24,True,False,,,,,0,1647904607,,0,{},i1le60e,False,t3_ti97yf,False,True,t1_i1jfkfv,/r/geopolitics/comments/ti97yf/have_american_sanctions_ever_actually_gotten_a/i1le60e/,1647904623,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647875807.0,

The most common method that China copied is how the USA usually will enact trade barriers first and it takes a few YEARS before WTO takes the case but the damage is done to the point that the US has a dominant position being it was first on the block with an working network while the other side needs to start from scratch 5-10 years later, that and your economy is already bad from that so you cant even invoke the WTO allowed counter being your economy needs to trade to the USA. 


The fact is all court rulings of the WTO are recorded, and is for public viewing. Made it allowable for China to devise a strategy to work in the WTO to its favor even if the WTO rules against it, same with how the US does it, because for the most part it is just a calculated ""expense"".

If you noticed, there's been provocations, but that's about it. No military escalation, no threats or public insults, nothing. That's because the Moroccan government greatly benefits from the status quo, and would prefer for relations to stay amiable, at least enough to foster trade, maritime and security deals. Spain is richer and stronger than Morocco, and most Moroccans know and respect that.

As for Ceuta and Melilla, I know you'll disagree with me, but in Morocco most claim that these cities were once Moroccan, and should be returned one day, akin to Goa that India retook from Portugal, or Hong Kong/Macau that China got back. But that's only in theory. In practice, most Moroccans don't really care enough about it, and they all prefer for peaceful relations with Spain, these cities be damned. 

Currently, Algeria is, alongside Qatar, the only viable sources of gas to Europe (due to the war in Ukraine). As such, Europe is shifting their attention to Algeria, and the Algerian government needs to keep good relations with them, and especially with Spain (because of the pipelines). As such, the Spanish government knows that Algeria is relatively happy with that deal, and will not back away from it. That's why they threw a bone to Morocco, by shifting their policy on the Sahara. The goal here is to satisfy Morocco while Algeria can't protest too much, so as to keep both southern neighbours ""happy"". Algeria recalled its envoy, but that doesn't change the fact that Algeria needs Spain as a gateway to Europe, so this move is nothing more than a message to say that they're unhappy, but ultimately it will change nothing.

Honestly, Spain did well, relations are assured with Algeria, and they still managed to get a bit closer to Morocco too at the same time. Smart :)

Lastly, forget about the nationalists. You see them a lot online, but they never represent the majority. Most Moroccans only mind their own business and don't really care much about Ceuta and Melilla. As long as relations with Spain are friendly and respectful, that's fine enough!

## What are the chances that Vladimir Putin will be tried for war crimes in Ukraine: Interview with Luis Moreno Ocampo

_The former prosecutor of the International Criminal Court told Clarín that he cannot be tried for ""aggression"", but it is possible for other crimes._

Luis Moreno Ocampo, one of the prosecutors in the trial that convicted the leaders of the Argentine dictatorship, is a prominent figure in global justice. Between 2003 and 2012 he was the first prosecutor of the International Criminal Court and from that position he investigated more than a dozen world leaders for serious crimes in Syria, Afghanistan, Libya, Sudan and other countries. Years later, the Argentine was in charge of collecting evidence, at the request of the OAS, about possible crimes against humanity committed by the Venezuelan Nicolás Maduro and the case is now in The Hague. From Malibu, California, where he currently resides and is a professor, Moreno Ocampo spoke with Clarín about the war crimes that are being committed in Ukraine andthe chances that the Court will impeach Russian President Vladimir Putin.

__Q. What is a war crime?__

In war, soldiers can kill soldiers, but they cannot kill civilians, they cannot kill prisoners, and they cannot destroy certain historical sites or civilian places. To connect it with Ukraine, a war crime would basically be an attack on civilians or an attack on civilian places, as was the case for example in the theater that was bombed. But in addition to the crimes that are committed during wars, there is the crime of ""making"" war. At Nuremberg the main charge against the Nazis was the crime of aggression, of having started a war. This is very important to understand, because starting a war is worse. That is why the crime of waging war is a crime of aggression, it is the most serious crime. It means using the forces of one state against the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or political independence of another state. That is the most serious crime committed in Ukraine and that is the crime that Putin clearly committed. Unfortunately, he is not going to be tried for that crime.

__Q. Why?__

Because this crime requires that both the aggressor and the attacked country be members of the International Criminal Court and Russia is not. But, if it is not, the alternative is for the United Nations Security Council to send the case to the prosecutor of the Court. That is not going to happen because Russia has veto power in the Security Council. Both Russia, the United States and the 5 countries that have veto power in the Security Council can block that decision. Although there is a law that describes the crime of aggression and there is an International Criminal Court - something that did not exist in Hitler's time - this crime against the Russians cannot be investigated.

__Q. And can Putin be prosecuted for any other crime than aggression?__

Yes, exactly what the current prosecutor is doing. Ukraine accepted the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court already in 2013. The prosecutor is going to investigate crimes committed since 2013, because there were conflicts in Ukraine in 2012, but they are going to include current crimes. The prosecutor was in Lviv two days ago, he is very active and says that he will be impartial. He is going to investigate the Russians, but also the Ukrainian forces and the militias. There are many high-security militias that are active and the prosecutor announced that he is going to investigate all of them.

__Q. So the Court can investigate possible war crimes committed by Russians in Ukraine.__

Yes. For example, this theater bombing in which civilians were killed is already clearly a war crime. But who committed it is history because who ordered that bombing we don't know. Whoever ordered that bombing knowing there were civilians in there may be responsible. If it is a mistake, it will be more difficult to condemn it. In principle, what happened in this theater is a war crime, but it must be investigated.

__Q. If there had been a military chief who purposely ordered the bombing of that theater, could the Court try and sentence him in that case?__

Yes, I could. The Court is in the initial process, is investigating. The prosecutor has to gather the evidence of the facts and has to have evidence that an officer was the one who ordered the crime. After that, an arrest warrant issued by the Court is requested and must be implemented. Of course, if the person the prosecutor is accusing is a Russian general who is in Moscow, it is very difficult to arrest him. If he is a Russian captain who is in the Ukraine it is different. If it is a Russian captain who is already imprisoned in the Ukraine, it is very easy. It depends on which person the prosecutor selects is the difficulty or the ease of arresting him. Without an arrest there is no trial. There is no trial in absentia at the International Criminal Court. But today's goal is to stop this violence and what the prosecutor could already do is try a case against a captain or lieutenant who is already arrested by Ukraine, send him to the Court and deal with that case. Why is it important ? Because it would serve as a preventive impact for the other Russian officers who are in Ukraine: they cannot kill civilians because they can be tried.

__Q. If any of these soldiers say that they acted on a superior order, on Putin's order, for example, can't the Court do anything either?__

Yes you can. Before the Criminal Court there is no immunity, not even a head of state. The issue is the lack of evidence because I do not believe that Putin himself gave the order to bomb the theater. But if he did it, the Court can do it. The issue is to get this evidence that Putin is personally involved in war crimes. There is a crime called forced displacement that is a war crime, but also a crime against humanity in which it would have to be shown that the Russian strategy was displacement. There are currently three million displaced people and it would have to be shown that this is part of a Russian strategy ordered by Putin. That is possible, plausible that it is so. But you have to prove it too. The prosecutor has to look for the evidence, without the evidence he cannot.

__Q. Could the United States or any member of NATO help in that investigation by providing evidence?__

Any country can help in the investigation. Ukraine is asking for it, the Court is there to help them. The prosecutor went to Ukraine and was received by the president and everyone is at his disposal. There are 39 states that have asked the prosecutor to investigate the Ukraine case and those are all the European states, Costa Rica, Canada.

__Q. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken claimed that there are war crimes in Ukraine.__

The complicated United States issue. The North American political strategy is that they support the International Criminal Court in the cases that interest them. pure pragmatism.

The US is also not a member of the Court.

They have no obligation. It is a purely political situation. So the US strategy is: we support the International Criminal Court in the cases that interest us. In my time they supported us a lot in Uganda, in Kenya, in Darfur and of course they didn't want to know that we would get into Iraq or Afghanistan. That argument would lead me to think that they should not support a case against Russia, because Russia is not part of the Court like the United States, therefore, there is a kind of legal and political dilemma that they are evaluating. Faced with these conflicts, we have a problem of institutional design. There is no solution to the conflict because the only world institution that can deal with crime is the International Criminal Court. The UN Security Council is not going to get involved because it has the veto power and then there is no more. There are no world institutions to manage the conflict and that is what we are seeing. So the alternative is war or frustration. On the side of frustration, the only thing there is is the judicial effort and the diplomatic effort, nothing more.

__Q. But is there any hope?__

Ukraine is very frustrating, but there is an opportunity to learn and improve. The new generations, especially the young, have to learn that the technological advance that allows us to communicate has not yet reached the management of violence. Technological advancement is used to make better drones or weapons to kill, but not to improve peace issues. It seems to me that we have to use this conflict to learn. Nelson Mandela, the South African leader, said “I never lose, I win or I learn”. Ukraine is the chance for humanity to learn to manage conflicts.

The recently emplaced economic sanctions against Russia by the US and EU, while very significant, are much less effective because of this. 


Also, going forward, it is projected that due to the continued weaponization of the dollar countries will increase the percentage of reserve held and trade in other currencies.

As you stated the continued use of economic dominance by countries has lead and will continue to lead to the growth of alternatives and diversity of the sourcing of goods.

I hate to use that term as I know it's a pejorative at this point, but the two big guiding texts of our current foreign policy establishment were Fukayama's ""End of History"", and Krauthammer's ""The Unipolar Moment"". These people really believe this stuff. It's how they were educated. There are no realists in the US government. 

  
There is also another issue: Humans aren't always rational actors. Emotional considerations often cloud their judgment. You see this on the Democratic side. The hostility is so apparent that even normal state functions became evidence for a nefarious scheme. While I may have my issues with Trump, I think he is more a slimy businessman than a Russian agent. I remember when the Helsinki Summit happened and people called it the ""Traitor Summit"". It was ludicrous. We weren't at war with Russia. Was Trump expected to slap Putin on camera? Trump was doing a charm offensive. Kennedy tried that and failed. Trump failed too. Even the instances where Trump was accused of helping Russia were due to Trump having a big mouth rather than actual nefarious intent. If we look past the superficial talk, the substance of Trump's policy toward Russia was not different from his predecessors. There were more sanctions on Russia during his tenure, not less. While he did do some slimy crap with Ukraine, he still went along with selling them more weapons, not less. 

Many people get viscerally angry when I point that out, but it's important because it shows continuity in US foreign policy that transcends the individuals who are elected. Trump would do pretty much everything Biden is doing, and likely be even more belligerent. It's due to that irrational fear of all things Russia in the US. It's been building for years. You can't have a rational policy in that kind of environment. It blinds you to reality and you often act in ways that are not in your self-interest. 

When people write about the end of the US empire - because that's what we are getting right now. I think three things will be seen as fatal mistakes:

1. The ""catastrophic success"" in the US's defeat of the USSR. The breakup of the USSR allowed Russia to stop funding its former satellite states and focus on strengthening itself. One of the reasons Ukraine is so poor is that Russia no longer subsidizes it. 
2. Arming religious fanatics throughout the MENA countries who came to be a thorn in the side of US. This led the US to bleed itself dry over the last twenty years. It also gave space for China to rise without real objection from the US.
3. Aiding China in its rapprochement of Russia. isolating Russia made it all the more tenable for that rapprochement to occur. By the time we realized what we had done, it was too late to stop it. Biden's calls to Xi are a desperate attempt to unwind that alliance and it won't work. 

I do ultimately agree with you that Russia would have preferred to be part of the Western world, but it was apparent by 2007 that it would never happen. The US was always going to be hostile to it. before the NATO conference you spoke of, the US had pulled out of several arms treaties with Russia. They began to view the US as a bad actor. In the last five or six years, most of the writing I've seen from Russian commentators has stated that Russia can never trust the west, the west will never accept them, and they should leave the west behind. I think that's what has happened here. People think it's only Putin that is the problem, but that needlessly personalizes the issue.

China will not let that happen. They can't if they want to continue their rise. There's an old geopolitical theory at play here that comes from Mackinder. Remember the ""World Island""? While the European powers colonized the world, a contradiction was apparent during that time that is still with us today. While these powers could project around the world, they could not dominate Europe. Why? Russia. 

Russia in Mackinder's analysis serves as a necessary pivot state, It has a weak hand, yet is strong in many areas. In order to dominate Europe, you've got to have control over that landmass. It is the most resource-rich landmass outside of Africa on that side of the planet. It's why Russia was invaded over and over again. It's why the US is sanctioning Russia to death and engaging in a proxy war via Ukraine. If the US wants to stop China, they have to weaken Russia and regain the control they had over that state in the 90s. 

Most of the user base of Reddit isn't old enough to remember when Putin was popular in the US. I'm 40, so I saw it. I remember when Russia was part of the ""War on Terror"". It all changed when Putin began to seize control over Russia's major commodities from oligarchs. The transformation of Putin into the ""demon of the east"" was complete when Russie defied the US and invaded Georgia. I don't think people understand that the reason Putin is so deeply hated by US officials is that he ended the US neo-colonial project in Russia. This ensured the US would be unable to completely control Europe. It also means that the US can't really contain China. 

I've watched Chinese media outlets for years. One thing that is very apparent is the amount of hostility toward the US has increased dramatically in the last few years. It seems that many in China believe a confrontation with the US is inevitable at this point. We've been sanctioning them for years - the trade war. Many Chinese news commentators have been stating that the US will sanction China more and that the US wants to destroy Russia so they can get to China. Perhaps paranoia, I don't know. Many analysts in the West believe that China wouldn't engage in hostility, or openly support Russia, for economic reasons. That is a mistake. In matters of statecraft, security matters more than economic issues. States are willing to endure a lot of pain if they think there is an existential threat to them. That's one of the reasons sanctions tend to not work.",d69ed3123a8ca7fe5612caeb0456fe7ecb77ff2e,True,False,,,,,0,1647870666,,0,{},i1j32y5,False,t3_ti97yf,False,True,t1_i1hzutw,/r/geopolitics/comments/ti97yf/have_american_sanctions_ever_actually_gotten_a/i1j32y5/,1647870680,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647841866.0,

Personally, from a posturing standpoint, I don't think the Biden/Xi Jinping meeting was a strategically wise decision at this time. It sends a message that the US is genuinely concerned at what is happening and doesn't necessarily invoke a picture of confidence. 

This kind of reinforces the notion that Biden has a very odd idea of how the strategic partnership between Russia and China has evolved. His chat with Putin last year apparently was along the lines of ""Hey, we (the US) can really help you out with your Chinese problem, we know you guys are really concerned about that"", which was followed immediately by Xi and Putin proclaiming that they are strategically aligned.

And even though many sanctions frameworks have been ineffective in stopping deadly conflict, the examples still show that when implemented properly, they can.

[],False,,mng8ng,,,[],,,,text,t2_7w6b4,False,True,"It is known the United States and other free-world countries are supplying other types of military assistance to Ukraine, such as portable anti-tank and anti-air weapons. On Wednesday, Biden authorized an additional $800 million in aid, and Congress has approved more than $13 billion in military and development assistance. Intelligence sharing has been ongoing. Humanitarian and medical aid is also pouring into the region from around the world. All of this is to the good.

However, this article ponders why not give the Ukrainians the tools they need to win? The usual one-word answer is “escalation.” The assumption is that there is an unstated threshold of support, which, once crossed, would result in an escalatory spiral, perhaps to the level of nuclear conflict. Biden invoked the escalation model when he said sending the Polish MiGs would start “World War III.”

By this logic, Washington can give Kyiv a little but not too much. Our policy seems to be to let Ukraine lose the war, just more slowly.

The Soviet Union was not concerned about escalation when it supplied America’s enemies during the Vietnam War. The Kremlin gave North Vietnam all manner of supplies, including advanced weaponry and aircraft. Moscow sent its most sophisticated anti-aircraft weapons to defend Hanoi, and even supplied crews that shot down American aircraft. (Ironically, many of these troops were from Ukraine.)

And while the war raged, Washington and Moscow were actively negotiating important nuclear arms controls agreements. Strategic-level diplomacy was wholly detached from what was happening on the ground in Southeast Asia.

Current U.S. policymakers seem oblivious of the historical examples of American support – overt or covert – for friendly governments fighting adversary states. Policymakers should pay less attention to what Putin might do if we annoy him and instead do more to communicate what price the Russian dictator will pay if he continues his crimes against peace.

Meanwhile, the international community should give the Ukrainians everything they need to make Putin’s forces suffer dearly for bringing open war to Europe.

There are a lot of other examples where the Chinese have done this. The problem is that it is producing results that are unfavorable to the Chinese in every single one of these examples. In 2010, Japan imported 82% of its rare earth materials from China. This dependence was reduced to 58% in 2019, with the target of less than 50% in 2025. Right now, the US imports 80% of its rare earths from China, but in 5 years it will be less and in 10 years dramatically less because the US is opening its mines back up. Up until 1985, the US was the largest producer of rare earths. Those have since closed down due to the convenience of getting them from China but all of that is changing rapidly. Legislation is being passed that will restrict Chinese rare earths from government and military production.

What Chinese have not realized is that weaponizing their dominance in certain sectors makes people want to stop dealing with Chinese anymore in those sectors. In the solar cell example, Chinese were using their access to cheap and readily mined coal without any regard for the environment to drive down costs on those cells and then dumping the market, putting many producers globally out of business. All in a loud and clear eff you to the WTO which had bent over backwards to shoehorn them in. What producers started doing in response is making low carbon solar cells to make them easier to make and with the help of governments (US and EU) passing laws requiring lower carbon cells, as well as tariffs on Chinese cells, which the WTO agreed with.

Chinese seem to be under the mistaken impression that there are no consequences to this sort of behavior. Decoupling is happening and US investment in China is [tapering off](https://rhg.com/research/twowaystreet-2021/). You can add security concerns and the desire to be in a stronger position in relation to China when they attack their neighbors, engage in massive scale human rights abuses and collude with others engaged in war crimes to the list of other reasons. 

Finally, very few of these things right now that the US depends on China for are critical to US survival. The US is currently building stockpiles of rare earths to fill in until the mines come back online. And, sanctions in wartime do not only involve trade goods. In fact, asset freezes and banking sector sanctions are far more effective in targeting the war machine of any belligerent regime.",9b95d6814e7cf03536779ee6440baeb530266e3b,True,False,,,,,0,1647856626,,0,{},i1igi8r,False,t3_th3faj,False,True,t1_i1cflmg,/r/geopolitics/comments/th3faj/theoretical_sanctions_on_china_for_invading_taiwan/i1igi8r/,1647856641,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647827826.0,

That said, appreciation of our own language, culture, history etc. had steady leaps in 2004, 2014 and now. Exemplifying language: even those people who were still using Russian as their main language before started to adopt Ukrainian right now, out of spite, remorse and/or sense of national unification. It's not necessarily nationalist (even if Russia will most certainly shape it as such in their narratives) as it is just... natural, I guess. I was honestly 50/50 when it comes to daily usage of languages as I'm originally from Donetsk which was mostly Russian-speaking through most of the post-Soviet independence (even though evidence suggests it wasn't always the case) and now percentage of me using Russian shrinks significantly. There might be some associations/similarities with restoration of Hebrew in Israel, but Ukrainian was never on the verge of extinction as much as it was oppressed as if it was a dialect of Russian, which it isn't. People were slowly easing into it all this years until finally arriving to conclusion that it's inevitable we will mostly speak Ukrainian rather than Russian after that. A known Ukrainian leftist magazine [Commons](https://commons.com.ua/en/) suggests in [this article](https://commons.com.ua/en/na-zahist-rosijskomovnih-v-ukrayini/) that we should be less aggressive towards Russian-speaking Ukrainians when it comes to purely humane aspects (and that it has shades of victim blaming which I can agree with), but otherwise it very much sides with Ukrainian people and cheers the levels of consolidation. Because right now this seems to be a saving grace considering sheer quantities of Russian troops and tech sends towards us. They have more people but they've never expected population being in such dense opposition to them. 

The notion that US instated or even backed the current Ukrainian government is a typical conspiracy theory and will be considered such by anyone who is aware of who Zelenskyi is and who is in his team, as well. He's not just an underdog who rose to political power, he comes from a vaguely centric, mostly Russian language satirical comedian variety show, that was formed from a KVN team and KVN ('Club of Funny and Resourceful') was a distinctively Soviet-turned-Russian and Russia-backed show. Zelenskyi was mostly Russian-speaking up until announcing himself as a candidate for presidential elections. That said his variety show, the TV series he either created or starred in were all immensely popular so election results were, while a significant surprise from a political standpoint, not unmerited. And oftentimes he was criticized for views that are considered slightly phobic towards Ukrainians, as well as (now severed) business ties with Russia that were there long after 2014.  A lot criticized him for his ties with certain Ukrainian Jewish oligarchs and accused him of being their way into power which turned out to be somewhat inflated. He proved to be his own man after elections, even if his lack of political experience and expected nepotism tendencies (not worse than those in any previous government but contradicting his own election program) were met with disdain and some of his decisions were baffling to both experts and general population. 

As for the sentiments provided: they're rather typical for what I hear from leftists in the US, if slightly less harsh but yes, they are *very* defeatist and are very misinformed on ""right \[being\], already a significant factor"". Comparison to Proud Boys are not entirely unmerited when it comes to neo-nazi and right-leaning marginalized groups (as they are in any country, I imagine, since core points are usually the same), but such groups are not supported by general population. That all ""side note"" is ridiculous bordering on offensive when it comes to perception of Ukraine. Thousands of students of color and African Ukrainians are living and residing in Ukraine and although there are occasional remarks here and there from the far-right that would suggest they're not okay, it's nowhere near level of danger seen in Russia as local far-right are far more busy targeting either pro-Russian forces or LGBTQ. Neither of which is more common than in Russia, for example, because there's nowhere near as much of people in local organizations of that kind or bearing that sort of views. And more importantly such organizations are not in cahoots with police which seems to be default for Russia. We also have a ton of local minorities such as Crimean Tatar people and Mariupol Greek populace, both of which were recognized more and more after 2004 and 2014 in Ukraine, but were symmetrically more vilified in Russia at the same time. Also of note is that in stark contrast to Russian white supremacy and chauvinism some of the far-right organizations are surprisingly friendly and respectful towards The Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, which is vilified in Russia to immense degrees (and that concerns entirety of Chechen nation, to a point).

May I have your informed opinion on a related topic?  Some (not all)  ""Left"" opinion in North America (e.g., Jacobin Magazine, Democracy Now, Green Party of Canada) is hostile to the Zelensky government's resistance. I'm curious about the origins of such views.

 The line  goes something like this: 

'Russia is guilty of aggression against Ukraine albeit only after having been provoked by the US and the rest of NATO for decades. It's a terrible situation for Ukraine, moreover one that puts the world at the brink of nuclear war.

'The Ukrainian government was put in Kiev by the US. They are puppets moving pawns that the US and the other leaders of NATO are willing to sacrifice, even though they know that Ukraine can't prevail against Russia. We are against providing arms to Ukraine for the cynical purpose of prolonging death and destruction. We also are against a no-fly zone, which even Joe Biden admits would move the Doomsday Clock closer to midnight. We are for a ceasefire that will stop the carnage, and for negotiations leading to peace as soon as possible. Peace now!

'As a side note, the war in Ukraine does not present a situation analogous to the Spanish Civil War or French Resistance. Those with romantic notions that becoming a partisan in Ukraine bears any resemblance to the experience of a character portrayed in Leonard Cohen's famous song should wake up. This is real life, not a movie. Leftists should not entertain going to Ukraine to fight. There is no place for well-intentioned progressive people there. To the contrary, Ukraine's ""international brigades"" are a magnet for neo-Nazis,  White supremacists and other extreme rightists. The  Right, already a significant factor in Ukraine, is using this war to bolster its influence globally. Dangerous extremists like the Proud Boys are using it to develop military skills and political alliances that they can bring back here. Stay away!'

My own opinion is that, intentional or not, such views are self-fulfillingly defeatist and offer backhanded support to Putin. Do such views have any currency within Ukraine's ""Left"" or ""pseudo-Left,"" or even its ""Centrist/Conservative"" middle? Or, rather, are they simply constructs emanating from the North American political dynamic, perhaps with some help from Russia's disinformationists?

If freer societies are thriving, people in more authoritarian systems tend to see that as an example and start demanding more freedoms, becoming harder to govern. It does work one way more than the other IMO. However, if authoritarian norms prevail, over time it gets easier for those with authoritarian tendencies in democratic countries to start pushing the limits. To start constraining freedom. Plus, authoritarian powers may start to strangle the more free nations just because the example of freedom is so destabilizing to the authoritarians. 

Now that the world is smaller due to technology, there really is no live and let live long term equilibrium between freedom and autocracy. And the elites on both sides know this well.
