In a world where missiles do the job at longer range with higher accuracy (93% kill rate), why have the massive cannon?  APS systems are already being upgraded against kinetic rounds, so we may very well have a future where the only way to punch into an armored vehicle is target saturation - e.g. what missiles do trivially but slow fire single shot tank guns would struggle with.

As for armor, yes more armor makes them more survivable against lesser threats. But if even singular infantrymen have enough gun to kill any practical amount of armor from great range, you start reaching a point of diminishing returns fast.

 Armor on air planes is gone because it was a losing game to play (example: a10s needing to withdraw from front line combat in the Gulf war), vs using stealth and speed to avoid getting hit in the first place (example: f16s taking over the most dangerous jobs the a10 couldn't despite being unarmored). We see a similar trend in ships, where the only armor most modern ships have is kevlar splinter protection so the shattered fragments of shot down incoming missiles don't do quite as much damage. An Iowa class battleship is more survivable against a wider range of threats than an arleigh Burke, but no one cares - if all anyone will lob at you are huge ship killers at extreme range, being more survivable against 8'' shells is utterly irrelevant.

Yes people have been predicting the death of the tank since the 70s, so we should always be cautious. But people predicted the death of the battleship many times erroneously (see jeune exile) before it did actually end up happening. 

Some sort of future vehicle, armored enough to withstand machine guns and smaller autocannon rounds, focusing on missiles as it's primary anti armor weapon and mobility and stealth as its primary defense, just seems like a more sensible approach in modern times. Long range missile fire under cover of massive drone intelligence feed seems like the only way forward.",f876093161a210eb1755f49d287701d25302ebaa,True,False,,,,,0,1647904850,,0,{},i1leqjv,False,t3_tjb6cf,False,True,t1_i1k7j4s,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tjb6cf/ukraine_megathread_march_21/i1leqjv/,1647904865,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647876050.0,

My point is that NATO (or rather, specific NATO member's) and Ukraine's interests diverge in some areas and we should consider those areas.

On one side you have Russia who:
Invaded Georgia and established loyal breakaway statelets in 2008. Invaded and annexed crimea in 2014. Created breakaway statelets in the Donbas. And now, in 2022, has launched a 3-front invasion of Ukraine. 

On the other side you have Ukraine who: 
Has rejected (twice) moscow puppet leadership. Has refused to accept Russian ownership of its territory. Has restricted water supply to its territory that is occupied by Russia. Fought doggedly against invading forces while rallying the world for support. 

But like, ""groupthink""? Really? Like Russia ""Winning"" from the current position would require a definition of a ""win"" that I don't think anyone would have agreed with in the beginning. 


I know I am personally surprised by 2 main factors:

1. Russia's original, military objectives seem much more ostentatious that I had imagined. I expected them trying to secure the entirety of Donbas, and potentially the AZOV coast+ crimean fresh water supply. I didn't think they'd be so intent on Kharkiv, Zaporezhzhia, or anything west of Dnepr River. 

2. The lack of an apparent ""backup objective"" - like there doesn't appear to be a consolation objective here where Russia can quickly conclude the MILITARY campaign and sort of declare political objectives achieved.

[],False,,ituralde_,,,[],,,,text,t2_apm11,False,True,"I think Putin's goal here is to eliminate democracy in Ukraine.  

Ukraine is culturally linked incredibly closely to Russia - literal millions of Russian citizens have family in Ukraine or other similar deep ties.  The long term success of liberal democracy thus directly undermines the stories Putin has used as the foundation of his legitimacy.  

Belarus is incidentally in the same status here - these two countries are too connected to too many Russian people that Putin's government can survive their liberalization.  This is a huge part of why Putin has been so heavy handed, and why he cannot and will not back down from this even after it has already turned into a quagmire.  If anything, current Ukrainian resistance only probably proves to Putin the threat Ukraine represents; they've strengthened dramatically since 2014.  

Right now, the near term strategy is ""Victory with minimal pain"".  Speed is no longer as critical of a concern; the cat is out of the bag and the resistance is in place.  The next thing Putin wants to avoid is wider mobilization; he doesn't give two fucks about his people's safety but he doesn't want to spend any resources on this he does not have to in the long term and leaving too much blood in Ukraine is a destabilizing factor.  

Putin does not care about nearly as many destabilizing factors as a western government would.  He gets to arrest and/or disappear sources of public opinions that aren't his opinions. Meanwhile, he can actually use the death of his people to help galvanize support if he plays his cards right.  The whole point of propoganda that demonizes your enemies is that it prepares people to accept the costs necessary to defeat them, and that cost can be cast as evidence of how evil that opponent is.  Putin is already well past any sort of salvageable relationship with the truth anyways when it comes to this war.  

In the long term, Putin knows that China has to have his back.  China doesn't have other friends because they treat basically everyone around them like trash and see the rest of the world as people for them to exploit for their own profits.  There's a lot out there indicating that China's cooperation with the west and participation in the western economic system has an expiration date on that - and Putin is counting on that.  Or, at least, a fear that such an expiration date is effectively inevitable.  

In Putin's fantasy, he swiftly takes Ukraine and emboldens China with regards to Taiwan, and gets China much sooner behind a new ""second world"" economy.  With Ukraine as a puppet, Putin has enough of an agriculture under his thumb to feed the decidedly not self-sufficient China. If China wants to pull some shit before their population has literally aged out of working eligibility thanks to decades of the One Child policy, they need to be able to feed their people and with a stroke of a pen, the West can have them starving inside of two years.  An enormous land border with a friendly land power willing and able to feed you instantly solves those problems. In a world where Russia demonstrated competence here and overthrew Ukraine in 2 days as planned, they look way more valuable as an ally and a tool to keep Europe off the back of the Chinese.  

The upside part of that fantasy is almost entirely dead now; but the reality that China has been massively antagonistic to everyone within strategic reach of them and the need to feed their people don't go away.

All that being said, I believe we should endeavour to correct for what we *want* to happen vs what we *observe* happening. I haven't seen any evidence that Ukraine is going to be able to retake significant territory from the Russians (or at least, if they do, I believe it's lower probability than Russia holding territory). 

We should also take care not to downplay the immense human cost and tragedy of this war. I am seeing this less here, more so on Twitter, but the notion that Ukraine should ""hold out at all costs"" is easy to advocate for when you're not the one personally paying those costs. What is the point in fighting to the last man, woman, and child when the outcome is likely a foregone conclusion (Mariupol will, in all likelihood, fall). Honour? National pride? To hurt Russians? These are all real tangible things. But we tend to downplay the immense amount of damage that is being inflicted upon Ukraine for our own geopolitical goals. As I said before: NATO seems to be willing to fight Russia to the last Ukrainian.

Officially, it's because the T-14 is still in trials - but in reality, it's because it simply doesn't exist in significant numbers of combat ready units.

Russia probably has somewhere between 10-100 T-14s (and I am being very generous with that upper-bound), and not all of them will be combat ready.

The 16k, I dunno.. usually the ratio of wounded to dead is higher, but maybe the medical logistics are extra bad, so many more soldiers are dying than normal.

As you said, it's not clear what Donetsk/Luhansk/Chechen data is included.

In any case, the 10k/16k presumably does not include deserters, surrenderers, self-mutilators, etc. Also, scale it up to the number of days of fighting, since the leaked numbers in this thread were stale numbers as of March 18.

So I'd say my estimate seems plausible: as of March 20, perhaps \~20% of the original 200k invading force is either dead, wounded, deserted, surrendered, self-mutilated, or otherwise not able to contribute.

Yeah thats how its normally done. You pull some of your reserves up. 

Think US\\UK were some of the National Guard or Territorial Army will get a call when something big is kicking off. 

Same goes for conscription nations. You will get some of the reserve mobilized for combat. Without knowing Russia specifically you would want a month at least of refamiliarisation. 

But the bigger the call up the more your will push NATO to deploy long the Polish\\Romanian border is for him to fully mobilise. Its one of the many advantages we have. Most of our fighting power is professionals so already mobilised. We only need to deploy that is push from their current training\\other duties to the potential flash point. Russia would need to call them up and then train them up. 

Going back to your question they can create a short service call up. Pulling in reserve cohorts to do a 3 month stint in Ukraine creating a rotation of fresh forces. Or pull a cohort up and train them for a years deployment. 

All this said I am saying this from knowing western aligned military service.

[],False,,ituralde_,,,[],,,,text,t2_apm11,False,True,"The short answer is No, and it's wrong to think of the Russians as completely stalled here.  I've heard talk that the Russians are pivoting to a new set of objectives - namely the bulk of the Ukrainian regular forces deployed on the Luhansk/Donetsk front in the east.  If you follow Russian movements over the past week, they've been striking in four places:

* North out of the Mariupol region, closing that pocket tighter and advancing towards Zaporizhzhia along the East bank of the Dniper River. The critical item here is less the immediate advance and more the securing of an east-west supply route overland direct from Russia via Donetsk. 
*  Pivoting the Mykolaiv/Odessa front forces North along the West bank of the Dniper river, skirting Mykolaiv and advancing instead on Kryvyi Rih
* Turning the bulk of the forces at Kharkiv south to bypass that city (This seems to have been stopped pretty firmly, but can have served as a pinning attack if that proves to matter)
* Bypassing Sumy to the north to take major routes leading to Kiev.

I think it's reasonably clear that Russia's immediate forces are insufficient to take Kiev in the next few weeks.  However, Ukraine is running out of places to cross the Dniper river and keep their eastern forces armed and in the field.  

In the North, if they can finish locking down the Kyiv flank, there's not a whole ton of major obstacles between them and shutting of every crossing of the Dniper as far as Cherkasy.  In the south, Kryvyi Rih is the last major obstacle between the Russian advance and the massive resevoir upstream of the Kremenchuk Hydroelectric Dam.  

The upside is that Kryvyi Rih does not seem to be easy to bypass.  The Russians have been heavily limited to the road network thus far to their axes of advance, and the northerly bypass options are lacking.  

So in short, the Ukrainians still have to further lock down the last mobile elements of the Russian army before they can dream of counterattacking with conventional forces.  


The one exception to this is harassing the long, exposed supply routes the Russians are relying on to maintain their primary advances.  Basically every report I see shows that their Northern advance has very minimal control over very long, extended supply routes advancing down a very small number of major roads.  My understanding is there's been a lot of fighting in that entire region, and the longer that advance extends without total control, the less sustainable it is.  

The pain point in the south is Kherson.  Every map shows it as fully controlled by the Russians but there's no way they have that shit locked down.  It's probably not possible to actually disrupt too many of the supply lines there, but it's quite possible to asymmetrically tie up resources that might otherwise go towards an advance further along the line.  

The local win condition for the Ukrainians is to stretch the Russians out and to bleed them.  The most important component of that is keeping their own supply lines open to the west.",e5f530bdc245cb1b5600d51e225c793e434b1792,True,False,,,,,0,1647894720,,0,{},i1kqufc,False,t3_ti1om9,False,True,t3_ti1om9,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ti1om9/is_ukraine_capable_of_launching_a_major/i1kqufc/,1647894733,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647865920.0,

You're starting to see a lot more videos where the Ukrainian forces, particularly those from the Kyiv area, where they have dug significant fortifications.  Not just quick foxholes but wood and earth and sandbag bunkers.

“Russian forces are positioned in such a way that their general staff looks to be contemplating two large pincer movements into Ukraine,” according to him.  
  
“The weaker of the two will attack Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, from the north,” he continues. Within the Donbas area, the bigger onslaught will encircle Ukrainian soldiers.”  
  
“The core Russian force would move from the north-east through Kharkiv and from Crimea in the south, with Russian-led battalions acting as a pinning push,” he adds.

[],False,,ituralde_,,,[],,,,text,t2_apm11,False,True,"First things first, it's certainly the case that chemical weapons and biological weapons are not in the same category even though they are often talked about together.  

Chemical weapons at this stage are probably a larger logistical challenge to deploy at scale for any tactical application than they are worth.  That may change in the future, but a huge part of why they *were* more useful in the first world war had a lot to do with the human and resource concentrations involved on the Western Front.  Late in the war, the actual chemical killing power ended up being of secondary value to simply making people put on early 20th century gasmasks to impair them.  Even for mass murdering civilians, they aren't fantastic for killing lots of people in shelters or buildings without serious saturation.   I don't think we'll see them.  

I'm not sure we'll see biological weapons employed here either simply as a function of containment.  I don't think that Russia can look at their Covid response and expect the ability to release a biological weapon in Ukraine and not have it rapidly spread back to their own people. If you zoom in on a map and see just how many tiny villages there are literally everywhere, I don't see how it's possible to do a contained deployment of such a weapon.   

It just does not seem like a logical escalation in either case.  

In the chemical weapons case, the West would use it as an excuse to clamp down sanctions more firmly.  I think you will see this happen anyways as Russia more indiscriminately kills citizens going forward.  

In the biological weapons case I think you'd see an instant and aggressive NATO response, and I think even the Chinese would be hard pressed to keep silent on it.   Covid has not gone well enough for anyone to tolerate that.  I think you'd see an ultimatum on Putin's desk to fuck off and NATO ""Peacekeepers"" in Ukraine within 48 hours.",0ad2201fc6989d3994a272bc19a38d18a44a82b9,True,False,,,,,0,1647891108,,0,{},i1khrwg,False,t3_titbqs,False,True,t3_titbqs,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/titbqs/use_of_chemicalbiological_weapons_in_ukraine_and/i1khrwg/,1647891124,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647862308.0,

---------------

Summary of the podcast:

Michael Kofman joins Ryan once again to help us understand the Russo-Ukrainian War as its fourth week unfolds. They cover a lot of ground: Mike updates us on the three fronts — where Russian forces are making progress and where they are not — and how the stalling campaign might drive Moscow to dramatically change its war aims. He also explains why it’s hard to gauge the condition of Ukrainian forces, how Putin’s stated aim of Ukraine’s ‘demilitarization’ is playing out in terms of strikes against Ukraine’s industrial base, and what role Belarusian forces might (but probably won’t) play in the conflict. Mike and Ryan also discuss the effects of sanctions on the Russian military industrial base, detentions of senior Russian security officials, how long Russian military manpower can last, the role of elite infantry units in this campaign, and the chilling repressive apparatus that seems to be taking shape in Russian-occupied portions of Ukraine. Kofman provides a bracing warning: this war can still get worse in terms of the human cost as it transforms into war of attrition.

It is worth following him on twitter:

He also has a blog, but it hasn't been updated since Sept 2021, I wonder why he has been busy?

https://russianmilitaryanalysis.wordpress.com/

And here is a video of a talk he gave to Stanford on the Russian military buildup. Interesting that he was one of the few people that were mostly right about what has unfolded. And I remember seeing what appeared to be Russian attempts to discredit him personally in the run up.

A battlefield consists of two components. Infantry that can take and hold ground. Artillery that kills infantry. Armours role in this is multiple. It can be organic direct fire for infantry, so a big gun, fast firing hitting strong points you are assaulting or hitting the mechanised vehicles assaulting you. it can be used to hit other armour or it can be a tool of rapid exploitation in a break through. It can be held in reserve and used in the classic tank destroy role to rush to breaks in your lines and engage mechanised infantry and armour. 

We can push a number of other tasks onto the tank. It brings the brigade and division commanders a lot of solutions to a variety of problems. 

The big difference between a tank and a man portable missile in the anti tank role is during an assault you should be supported by artillery raining hell on the attacker so matey mcrocketface is keeping his rocketface deep inside his trench. One popping up and letting one off he will be the target of rifle fire from soldiers and autocannot from mech infantry vehicles. So will become somewhat distracted making keeping focussed on target a touch of a challenge. 

And depending on how you deploy the tanks could be well hidden, so instead of pounding an area with 120mm, you end up firing an expensive rocket that does nothing. 

Now these man portable rockets are great. They bring battalion and company commanders solutions to their problems. But its only as part of a wider combined arms. Just like the tank. They are parts of a machine.

How do you win a game of chicken, where you and an opponent drive straight at one another and whoever swerves first loses? There's just one winning strategy: take off your steering wheel and throw it out the window where your opponent can see. If you've committed to keep driving straight, then the opponent has to swerve. 

The logic of nuclear deterrence struggles to accommodate an actor that will threaten use of nuclear weapons to achieve its policy goals, and is prepared to carry out those threats. If we imagine that Russia is such an actor, then giving Russia what it wants is nearly always the optimal decision. I'm not aware of any Russian policy goals that are so objectionable that we'd all be better off living in a post-nuclear wasteland.

Fortunately, Russia is not such an actor. In the chicken example, to win you have to immediately, quickly, and obviously remove your steering wheel. You don't suggest that you might possibly consider maybe starting to think about removing your steering wheel under certain conditions; you just do it.

In the nuclear case this means *starting out* by plainly stating your intentions and which actions will see nuclear retaliation. For example, in Ukraine, that might be something like ""Ukraine is rightful and historic Russian territory. Russian armed forces will carry out a special military operation to correct the situation in Ukraine. Allowing weapons or military supplies to enter Ukraine will result in a nuclear response: Russian strategic forces will employ nuclear weapons to destroy any border crossing where military equipment enters Ukraine."" And then *actually following up on the threat*. Even better would be if Russia could make a physical commitment to the threat, for example, by using hypothetical missile-deployed, fail-deadly nuclear mines at the locations it intends to threaten. Try to defuse or destroy them, they go boom. Send weapons, we send the signal and they go boom.

There is current raids by Ukrainian special forces. There could be a raging insurgency in the rural regions that simply is indistinguishable from the Ukrainian army. 

Any angry young man who wants to fight has actual mechanised battle groups he can try to join up. The shallowness and pourosity of the Russian lines means there are options beyond shooting from windows in semi suicidal attacks. 

Insurgencies will build up where people have a will to fight but no outlet. 

&gt;How are they expected to reclaim lost territory with so much of their veteran forces locked down?

This war is in a very fluid state where we could argue for a material collapse by Ukraine leading to rushing Russian gains, Russia calling a couple of hundred thousand reservists or Ukraines pressure leading to chain reactions of breaking moral in the Russian formations. So its all speculation. 

But Ukraine has about 20 million males to call on (chopping the too old and too young plus usual unfit for military service that still might be 10 million). Id say medium term, over months its far easier for Ukraine to generate large formations of at least motorised light infantry. Its not like they are strangers to the vast, poorly trained armies Stavka pulled together in the Soviet German War. That said its far more likely western advisors would rather train them to be more of a western conscript army level. 

I am not saying they will do it. But it has to be on the cards. Especially given that a large portion of the males have already had conscription, pulling groups out the lines to train up to a decent level means that without a wide mobilisation by Russia, Ukraine can actually put large, coherent formations into the field in a few months. 

They also have the bottomless pit of American equipment slowly being turned on. 

I am very wary of pro Ukrainian takes as it can be a little too much seeing what you want. 

But I do think that if this war drags out to 3-4 months, Ukraines large body of military trained men is something that will begin to have an impact.",33d5a6273871742ec1a7eca20cccaebe59a968f3,True,False,,,,,0,1647881368,,0,{},i1jt0i0,False,t3_tjb6cf,False,True,t1_i1jf33o,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tjb6cf/ukraine_megathread_march_21/i1jt0i0/,1647881383,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647852568.0,

* being easily impressed by military parades and YouTube videos that breathlessly and uncritically praise new Russian equipment
* believing that 21st century wars are fought on spreadsheets, and whoever has the larger numbers of personnel and equipment wins

The entire concept of MAD relies heavily on the assumption that all people involved act rationally, with self-preservation in mind.

Past examples in the US have shown that this assumption is simply wrong and it's dangerous to rely on it.

If you're asking ""why is it OK to send rifles/MGs/Javelins but not planes/tanks"" well it's a long story. Basically it's ""accepted practice"" globally to supply small arms in proxy wars but not big expensive systems. Where you draw the line with what is ""acceptable"" is a gray zone that NATO probably wants to not get too close to- giving javelins, considering their effectiveness and high per unit cost, is definitely not the same as just supplying some assault rifles or ammo, but for what I can only describe as psychological reasons, is considered more akin to supplying small arms than to supply artillery, tanks, or planes.",975af18b707c43a23cc6865f7e1f537b7752ec2f,True,False,,,,,0,1647879296,,0,{},i1jnmso,False,t3_tjb6cf,False,True,t1_i1j4n12,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tjb6cf/ukraine_megathread_march_21/i1jnmso/,1647879311,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647850496.0,

&gt;If the west is too scared to arm the side it's backing in a conflict which ultimately serves as the defense of Europe itself against Russian aggression. Then the west truly is doomed. You can't be a pacifist and survive.

Again, the West *is* arming Ukraine, pretty heavily. It is not binary; not providing certain offensive weaponry cannot be framed as ""doing nothing.""

&gt;What will Russia do? Nuke Poland? Come on now. 

Maybe. Nobody knows. Russia is not behaving as an entirely rational actor. It is not beyond comprehension that Russia could attack a base in Poland or other NATO member seen as directly aiding in attacks on Russian territory. They would likely not start with a tactical nuke, sure, but an Article 5 violation would probably result in nukes eventually.

&gt;Clauses can be put in place that the weapons will primarily used within Ukraine's borders. Pretty easy go meet as that's where the fighting is anyway for the most part.

Words are worth little more than the paper they're printed on. It's not so easy to just declare ""these will never be used aggressively"" and ensure they never will, and ensure Russia will believe such limitations.

I'm not sure why you're framing this as an issue of fear. Russia has nukes, and has threatened to use them. Fear is healthy and necessary. That, of course, doesn't mean being paralyzed by fear, but by being deliberate and cautious in your evaluations.

Russian control:
- Chernihiv Oblast
- Donetsk Oblast 
- Kherson Oblast 
- Luhansk Oblast (all in Russian hands, several contested)
- Zaporizhzhia Oblast (city remains in Ukranian control)
- Sumy Oblast (just Lebdyn and Konotop in Ukranian hands)

Contested: 
- Kyiv Oblast (Kyiv is firmly in Ukranian control, but Hostomel, Poliske, Chernobyl, Bucha, Anotonov Airport are all in Russian hands now)

That's a lot of territory to liberate and it's all in proximity to Russian controlled rail, borders, and ports, and it's not super clear that Ukraine has many mechanized brigades that aren't fully committed in static positions, trapped in encirclement, or withdrawn to defend.

Eg, they report [8 motorized or mechanized brigades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_battle_for_the_2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine) - the 22nd, 72nd, 93rd, 57th, 59th, 53rd, 24th, and 14th. 

- The 22nd is at Siege of Kharkiv 
- the 72nd was withdrawn from Donbas in '17 to Kyiv, 
- the 93rd was deployed in '17 to 50km from Luhansk
- the 57th, part of [Operational Command South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_Command_South), is presumably still there
- the 59th was at the Battle of Kherson, withdraw as the city fell, and is now defending Mykolaiv
- the 53rd, one of the smaller mechanized brigades, hasn't had active deployment listings since 2016 
- the 24th was stationed near Horlivka by '17, but isn't listed as part of the Horlivka offensive
- the 14th has been defending at the Donestk front since '15

And while they can reconstitute parts of those brigades into new forces, there's a cost to that. How are they expected to reclaim lost territory with so much of their veteran forces locked down?

The other thing that hasn't yet appeared is insurgencies in the occupied territories, and I'm skeptical of western commentators who think that large scale, successful insurgent activity is a guaranteed outcome. Unlike the US, Russia seems perfectly willing to kill protesting civilians, and won't hesitate to blacksite anyone they think is a threat. That's already happening. There's definitely resistance in Melitopol and Mariupol from nationalist militias like Azov where capture would almost certainly mean death, but in Kherson, Konotop, Sumy, the DPR and Crimea and the small towns?

It worked every time so far so why wouldn't it work again?

Then it turned out that Ukrainians will not give up without a fight and the west's response was likely far more than what Putin anticipated. So the dudes they sent turn out to not be good enough, the old APCs turn out to be, well, old, helicopters have started to be shot down, the airfield was retaken and the nonexistant supply lines(since the war was supposed to be over in a week) are causing massive issues.

Would they want a large shipment of materiel, vehicles, and equipment that could, theoretically, strike targets within Russia? Of course they would - because they would then use those jets, missiles, etc, to strike Russian assets within Ukraine, which would be a much better use of those capabilities. 

Beyond that - they would probably love to strike at major staging points or supply hubs that are just on the Russian side of the border - as that would have a potentially outsized impact on the ability of the Russians to wage war. 

Having said that though, I agree with you that they probably see absolutely zero value in striking Russian population centres, or other obvious civilian targets. It'd only serve to galvanize Russian domestic support - potentially giving Putin cover to fully mobilize and call up reserves, and would also only serve to weaken Ukraine's international support.

As the Times [summarizes](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/18/us/politics/senate-intelligence-russian-interference-report.html): 

&gt; The report by the Senate Intelligence Committee, totaling nearly 1,000 pages, drew to a close one of the highest-profile congressional investigations in recent memory and could be the last word from an official government inquiry about the expansive Russian campaign to sabotage the 2016 election.

&gt; It provided a bipartisan Senate imprimatur for an extraordinary set of facts: The Russian government disrupted an American election to help Mr. Trump become president, Russian intelligence services viewed members of the Trump campaign as easily manipulated, and some of Mr. Trump’s advisers were eager for the help from an American adversary.

&gt; The report portrayed a Trump campaign that was stocked with businessmen with no government experience, advisers working at the fringes of the foreign policy establishment and other friends and associates Mr. Trump had accumulated over the years. Campaign figures, the report said, “presented attractive targets for foreign influence, creating notable counterintelligence vulnerabilities.”",aab1c7c4b2afb3b7f7e15393d01d3437914afa53,True,False,,,,,0,1647873506,,0,{},i1j9gfa,False,t3_timlu1,False,True,t1_i1j53th,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/timlu1/ukraine_megathread_march_20/i1j9gfa/,1647873518,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647844706.0,

A western commitment would entail training Ukrainian draftees and reservists safely in NATO countries and well equipped training bases.

Translation:

Vishiy: I am Vishiy from 3rd platoon of 2nd battalion, driver-mechanic of BTR 4

Fox: My call sign is Fox, I am 19 y.o and I'm from military base 3029, BTR platoon. When I got here I was assigned to BTR 4, because I am gunner of BTR 4-E by specialization.

Vishiy: In May It will be my 4th year in Azov.


Fox: It was my rotation, I arrived at my outpost and then the war broke out, we got pushed back to Mariupol. In Mariupol I got a new position with my BTR 4. I think it was the 8th of March when they started to advance onto our position, we got an assignment to drive in and cover the guys at our primary position, at which we saw 3x BMP 3 and we shot them up, one more BMP 3 appeared and was also destroyed, next we destroyed BTR 80, Typhoon, and one more BMP 3 ammo of which cooked off, then we shot at a Tanks back, Tank caught fire and after some time his ammo cooked off, next we drove further down the street and there about 50m from us we saw BMP 1 behind which there were about 8-10 infantrymen taking cover, we started to shoot it and also hit bellow the vehicle, eventually the engine blew up and couple of their infantry died. Overall more than 10 vics got destroyed.

Vishiy: We Instantly destroyed 3x BMP (BMP 3) after that BTR 80, later BMP 3, after it .

Typhoon, then we shot up a Tank, next 1x BMP 3, 2 Tanks and one more BMP (BMP 1). I noticed that they are unprepared, poorly trained and were not ready in case we fought back, and that we have fought back so strongly with our battle unit. (I assume he's talking about their BTR 4)

They expected that we would have retreated and surrendered but we fought back and they shat themselves. I don't know what they were expecting when they came to our land, we're fighting back with dignity, they will be forced to retreat.

If you are interested in real facts other than conspiracies, [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_the_Study_of_War) discusses funding. In short, ISW is a think-tank funded by major defense contractors. You can look at their stated [research policy here.](https://www.understandingwar.org/research) 

My personal belief is that they are interested in the Ukraine war for the same reason why we're here, because its the best thing going on in military affairs right now. As for [combat brief bias](https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Russian%20Operations%20Assessments%20March%2020_0.pdf), they seem pro-UA. To be fair, most Western sources are biased pro-UA. But, I think most telling however about ISW updates is that their sourcing comes heavily from UA MoD. So it is likely biasing their reporting. Does that mean they're not doing fact checking on UA? No, it seems like there is some level of validation that is occurring. For instance, their map matches other Western reporting on combat mapping, and they attempt to assess which UA counteroffensives actually gained ground. However, I would not rely on ISW to give you Russian combat events and UA combat losses. They just don't seem to be sourcing from the Russians. That might be because they view the Russians as untrustworthy. It might be because more positive news on UA gives them better clicks. Dunno, but they do provide a decent summary of UA press releases.",ea471fc2b679663ad6233743a581c1b319b0fa4a,True,False,,,,,0,1647856381,,0,{},i1ig7ld,False,t3_timlu1,False,True,t1_i1i56c6,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/timlu1/ukraine_megathread_march_20/i1ig7ld/,1647856397,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647827581.0,

North Korea has had credibly tested ICBMs for *years*. From the article: 

&gt; *The Hwasong-17’s size has several implications. If it works as intended, it will have the range to reach any part of the continental United States. But this isn’t this system’s value-add to North Korea’s nuclear deterrent: the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15, both tested in 2017, showed an ability for North Korea to range parts and all of the contiguous forty-eight U.S. states, respectively. The Hwasong-17 is almost certainly a vehicle for launching multiple warheads.*

By credibly tested I mean that US and its allies have tracked the test launches on radar to observe their maximum altitude, calculated the energy needed for such a flight, and determined it is enough for the Hwasong-15 to hit Florida. The author of this article is one of the people who made these calculations.

During the European led EU Libyan action it was noted that PGM use was unsustainable beyond a 3-4 month window. These are richer nations with a greater focus on airpower. The scale of the Ukrainian war dwarfs that action. If remotely proportional reserves were kept relative to these countries economies it wouldn't be unrealistic to burn the whole stockpile in a week or two during a conflict of this scale.

If a reserve must be kept for escalation, not even direct, but offensive equipment supply (rather than defensive thus far) as a conservative measure then it tracks that Russia doesn't have frivolous amounts to burn. Old cruise missiles make sense to burn first while saving PGMs for emergency.

[],False,,NotTheBatman,,,[],,,,text,t2_5258h,False,False,"You have to break out the number of troops into those who are actively engaged in military operations, and those held in reserve. In WW2 the Russians had mobilized tens of millions of men, but they weren't capable of deploying all of them simultaneously. It would have been impossible to simultaneously equip and coordinate such a large force.

So let's say Russia had 30 million troops mobilized, and could theoretically field 10 million in active operations (disclaimer: fake numbers). What would happen is Russia would conduct operations with their best available troops, and would fill in any losses from their reserves. So losing 2 million troops (20% of deployed forces) would render many of their units ineffective, but you send in the replacements to fill the gaps and get back to 10 million. You try to mix in replacements and veterans as evenly as you can, because a single unit loses a lot of its effectiveness if it's too green.

When losses to equipment, supplies, and the command structure become severe enough you have to consolidate deployed units. That 10 million number may drop to 9 or 8 million, and your army may have to cede ground or give up on a front entirely.

In purely defensive scenarios you can stomach much larger than 20% losses and continue to be successful, because individual squads can act on standing orders. You don't always need an officer actively coordinating a situation that can be boiled down to ""hole up in a building and shoot any Germans you see."" Offensive operations and defense in depth operations do require active coordination, and can die out with surprisingly shallow losses.

The Soviets had such large manpower and industrial bases that they were able to operate while sustaining extreme losses against the Germans on the Eastern Front. When the Russians finally broke the German offensive at Kursk they suffered a 5:1 ratio of losses compared to the Germans, in both men and equipment, even though they were in fortified defensive positions for the entire battle. This is because they would cede ground when necessary (defense in depth) and constantly replenish their losses from their reserves. The Germans thought that they had anticipated this, and still were stunned by how extremely deep the Soviet reserves were.

This doesn't mean the Soviets could just hand a willing (or unwilling) recruit a gun and send them to the front. Even in their desperate situation they spent at least a full month training their replacements before deploying them. Ideally they would have spent a full 3 months in training like US soldiers, but they were trying to strike their best balance between shoring up losses and having effective new recruits. The Germans had undisputably the most effective military in both WW1 and WW2 on a pound-for-pound basis, but they didn't have a large enough industry or population to keep up with losses on multiple fronts.

A modern war cannot be conducted with soldiers that have trained for a single month. It takes 3 months to get a cookie cutter crayon-eater into the war who won't instantly get himself killed doing something stupid. Ukraine has plenty of recruits but it needs time to fill losses, and they also are desperate for equipment. Russia is also desperate for replacements, which is why they're turning to mercenary groups to hold the line until they can train up their own recruits. It looks like both sides are quickly becoming incapable of conducting offensive operations, which is why things are mostly stalling out and Russia has resorted to scorched earth artillery tactics.",f8e40167e8d14627f484077f9f5779d4803fd23a,True,False,,,,,0,1647832517,,0,{},i1hk5u0,False,t3_timlu1,False,True,t1_i1fq0sy,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/timlu1/ukraine_megathread_march_20/i1hk5u0/,1647832533,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647803717.0,

I don't believe you are.

With fire and forget hardware, it's not the ambush that matters, though certainly there is little I see which suggests the Ukrainians are past masters or even really well trained students of the art.

What's important is the getting to the site on a time to intercept basis.  And getting away from it before the reaction force can pin you down.  Which is really tough, in winter, through snow, on foot.

To be done correctly, it requires overhead targeting to predict the timelines.  And cross country maneuver in strict avoidance of any and all maneuver routes with close-in protection by UAVs overhead.  Looking for FLIR or GMTI tracks to either side and behind the group.

It requires constant drone resupply of weapons and fuel to hide sites and a network 'come get us!' system to move between them as the thundering herd moves closer and closer to it's final COG phaseline.

You have to stop the spearhead, you have to stomp on it's gas.  Those are two distinct objectives and considering it's only 50km from the border to Chernihiv and 150km from Chernihiv to Kyiv, you cannot just 'assume it will all turn out alright'.  So, like lions, you have to stay on the migratory trail which translates to long exposures in pursuit movement, even at night.

Similarly, when you hit the lead FSE or Van you cannot afford to stick around.  You have to get in, get it done, and get out.  Putting so much shock on the column that you not only head and tail it.  You also do every vehicle inbetween.  Given a 1km vs. 4km range point variance, this means your team has to be operationally split and capable of performing coordinated independent, attacks.  With little or no radio.

You cannot still be setting up the ambush when they roll up.  You cannot engage in 15 or even 5 minute firefights when you open the contact.

Because as soon as the lead tank blows up the first thing they are going to do is drop in-column artillery on you as mortars firing through a roof hatch or enroute SPH (assuming 10-20km spacing between lead and van) at a roughly 30-120 second interval before first splash.

And then they are going to bring in CAS/CCA or, if that doesn't work due to man portables, they will roll back the lead units, just like we did when the Shaboob dropped on us in 2003 and the Fedayin came out of the dust like wolves.

So, even if you get the entire column, you cannot afford to just stand there hanging around because, if you are \_anywhere near\_ the target when that QRF event happens, you will be cut off, run down and butchered.

Why is this not happening?  Because the people who are doing this have access to not just first-string ATGW but also SOF only munitions like Switchblade which doubles the flyout and removes the LOS requirement.

More importantly, they have access to secure satcomms which we would never 'just give away' to any Joe Bondarenko who came in promising to kill Russians.

And finally, they are UCW specialists with maximum force onset and fade tactical prowess like NONE of the Ukrainians have yet displayed. 

So tell me, if these videos show 'well trained' Ukrainians are unable to hit a Convoy at multiple points then fade to a rally before the reaction force pierces the backside of the ambush and rolls them, how is that that these multi-vehicle kill events are happening?

How is it that these people are actually /still living/ to go back and scavenge like common chav dumpster divers?  I know of no ODA 'teacher trainer' effort which would instruct SFA like that.

So the reality is that the kill sites these miraculously mobile media teams are visiting with Ukrainians all over them are hours if not days cold with the nearest Russian unit miles away.

And if the Ukrainians didn't do the deed, who did?

Why haven't all those boxes and supplies been long since carted away?  Could it be that professionals don't loot the dead but are already next-evolution mission focused instead?

Tell me who that sounds like to you.

We have a senile moron in office as Commander In Chief.  Who is leading our national defense?  Who is doing our foreign diplomacy?  Who is making the weighted economic and military decisions that says that slapping the bear from the bushes with American hardware is such a good giggle idea that non-American Operators would make it twice as nice?  We don't even have a face to put the policy to because nobody will admit that Biden is non compos mentis.

And whoever these \_bureaucrats\_ running things from the Deep State really are, they are defacto acting without an eye towards our national best interests.  Which is how such shovel headed intervention-is-free stupidity tends to start to snowball as a lifer thinks they are suddenly Jame Retief, diplomat extraordinaire, licensed to kill, without reference to the electorate who hired his boss, not him.

Mark My Words:  There are Unacknowledged Special Operations Forces, composed of regionally indigenous ethnic speakers/cultural natives, trained by CIA CAG/CAD, and riding ATVs or NSTVs out in the Ukrainian North 40, playing tag you're dead with Russian army main force elements.

And sooner or later, without a plan to introduce major combatant forces as U.S. reputative will, into theater, to OWN the consequences to the action our career State Department diplomats ""Everyone but Russia should join NATO!"" and their little pet USOF assassins have kicked off, even said Russians will begin to twig to the obvious and take steps.

What's worse, because they have taken such horrific losses as 'only the Russians know how to' (pure propaganda designed to mask USOF hyper competency with regular troop supposed imbecility) they will use standoff tactics to starve the Ukrainian civilians in place while shelling them back to the stone age and thus all the super secret squirrel sh\*\* will be ///FOR NOTHING/// as Ukrainian nationals start dying in the hundreds, every day.

All because we wouldn't move in beforehand to set a here and no farther FLOT.  And we dare not now.

That Russian nuclear first use is on the table.

Euromaidan and Ukraine's westward shift since 2014 has been primarily about EU membership and shifting economic ties West. NATO was never a particularly big part of it. And Russia does not want a Western leaning liberal democracy on its border, which it considers destabilizing to its regime. And shifting westward, fwiw, is probably in Ukraine's best interest from a long term economic point of view.

&gt; I say that Boris Johnson, Emanuel Macron, and Joseph Biden or their successors immediately strategic nuclear weapons up the cities and asses of Putin and all the oligarchs that support Putin. However, before they do that, they need to get on national television, radio, and all the social media platforms within reach and explain directly and precisely to the British, French, and American people what nuclear war means and that they are going to nuclear war because Russia just attacked Poland or the Baltics. If by the end of the speech, their close protection units have not drawn their guns and shoot them in the head and the second, third, and fourth in the succession order don't immediately come up and explain that, no no, NATO isn't going to nuclear war with the Ruskies, they can immediately fire off the nuclear weapons.

As a member of the Commonwealth in a far away land unlikely to catch an ICBM where I live, we will miss you and keep you in our hearts and continue the Anglo traditions elsewhere.

Article 5 is only on member state territory. Proving again you know literally nothing about the subjects you discuss.

&gt; I didn't specifically make those claims. But if you want to talk about reality of nuclear wars, then see the above. There's no point theorising that it will absolutely will not happen, because nobody fucking knows for sure what will happen in a nuclear war because we have never had it.

&gt;The so called ""realist"" perspective is outdated and inaccurate. You ""realists"" were saying Russia wouldnt invade Ukraine after Crimea. You ""realists"" were saying that Russia needed to invade Georgia to secure its borders.

I didn't say that, specifically

&gt;The article I linked says that Putin also wants to invade Poland and the baltics, what do you ""realists"" say to that? That we should just bend over and YET AGAIN DO NOTHING?

I say that Boris Johnson, Emanuel Macron, and Joseph Biden or their successors immediately strategic nuclear weapons up the cities and asses of Putin and all the oligarchs that support Putin. However, before they do that, they need to get on national television, radio, and all the social media platforms within reach and explain directly and precisely to the British, French, and American people what nuclear war means and that they are going to nuclear war because Russia just attacked Poland or the Baltics. If by the end of the speech, their close protection units have not drawn their guns and shoot them in the head and the second, third, and fourth in the succession order don't immediately come up and explain that, no no, NATO isn't going to nuclear war with the Ruskies, they can immediately fire off the nuclear weapons.

Because that's what will happen anyway with a conventional confrontation between Russia and NATO under Article 5. Alternatively, NATO disintegrates. I'm saving you the troubles of theorising the end. I support that course of action wholeheartedly and hope you guys have fun. As a member of the Commonwealth in a far away land unlikely to catch an ICBM where I live, we will miss you and keep you in our hearts and continue the Anglo traditions elsewhere.

&gt;Link me one source from Putin that says otherwise. So called ""realists"" dont actually believe in reality. They dont use evidence of leaders actual ambitions. ""Realists"" rely entirely on naivety. Prove me wrong, but I know you can't.

I didn't specifically make those claims. But if you want to talk about reality of nuclear wars, then see the above. There's no point theorising that it will absolutely will not happen, because nobody fucking knows for sure what will happen in a nuclear war because we have never had it. Previous wars show a dangerous trend towards escalation. Want to try your hand at it?

If Ukraine had been soundly rebutted from the get go this bloodshed could have been avoided but this bloodshed is well within nato and Russian interests so it takes place.

The most disgusting example I've seen is that when I suggest that if NATO and Western powers want to help Ukrainians, and I mean in direct, meaningful ways that prevent them from dying, the obvious solution is to provide an open door policy for Ukrainian refugees. It doesn't require NATO starting World War III or firing a single bullet at any Russian in anger. I was accused of being a Russian shill and helping Putin doing ethnic cleansing of Ukraine. Their solution was of course: to funnel weapons to Ukrainians so they can fight insurgency and bleed out the Russians.

I have to point out precisely what they are trying to to is to bottle up Ukrainians who want no part of the war on either side and just want to live, and force them to fight and die to *the West's* idea on what a nation should be or the people inside the nation should do. They should fight Russians and die in the process, if need be. Can they have a choice and take a way out? No. Is that freedom? Is that humanism? I understand that Great Power politics demand weapon and ammunition support to *whoever wants to fights,* who wants to leave, *let them leave*.

So they don't want to accept and resettle Ukrainian refugees. They are also cowards who are afraid to actually die in Ukraine for Ukrainians (they don't volunteer).

But sure, over the last decade or two (or three) I would have supported proactive, multilateral, moves towards making them NATO members. Or more realistically perhaps narrowly demilitarised NATO partners whose security was still guaranteed but would not act as a staging position on Russia's doorstep for strategic forces or whatever else Russia couldn't tolerate.

Fundamentally, I don't think that would have worked either, because I suspect Putin has been dead set on conquering/reintegrating Ukraine et al since long before he took power. But those discussions might have moved the issue forward earlier and in public, exposing the truth that Putin in fact *had* no realistic terms for anyone to meet.
