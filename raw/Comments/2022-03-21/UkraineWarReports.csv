4 weeks ago I would have believed that and peddled that same line.

&gt; Time and again he has rigged elections, murdered opposition and threatened citizens

And people kept supporting him and voting for him. Lots of people.

&gt; You don’t see rallies like the size of Nazi Germany.

But they are starting now. This is not good:

I understand they are paid to show up or tricked into attending. But Hitler organized his rallies too.

Putin may be a cheap, rusty, knock-off Hitler. But he's still a new Hitler.

&gt; there was a cartoon making fun of him.. that would never be allowed now.

And in the time between Medvedev and Putin part two the Russian people didn't care that they weren't allowed to make cartoons of their leader anymore. That was the time where people should have taken to the streets. Now it's too late, now it's damn hard for the Russians to get rid of him. But they still have to.

Yes, when Putin is finally down, we should avoid the mistake from WW1 and see that we build up Russia and not strangle it. But until Russians bring us Putins head, we should treat Russian people as Putins enablers.

And if it takes a bloody civil war for Russia to get rid of its cleptocracy, so be it. At least that would not cause suffering outside Russia.

It's not against you or your ex. Every single Russian is still a human. 

But any significant group of Russians is a threat that needs to be contained, as it will only spread crime and violence. For most of my life I have resisted this realization, but I'm now starting to accept that not Russias leaders are corrupt but Russias society as a whole is broken.

For example, armies have far fewer generals than enlisted men.  If an army losses a general, it is likely taking significant casualties.  The US military lost 32 generals in World War II  versus 400,000 total losses.  Russia has lost 5 generals, depending on whether or not Chechian generals are counted.  The wars are different and command structures are different, so a direct ratio of losses cannot be calculated.  It is likely, giving the number of generals lost, that Russian losses are significant

Militaries taking heavy losses tend to try and hide losses.  Russia only transports dead soldiers at night, refuses to recover many fallen soldiers, and refuses to regularly provide numbers of fallen soldiers.

Militaries taking heavy losses tend to show recruitment desperation.  Russia has recently changed the law to allow children to fight in the Russian army.  The Russian army has begun hiring mercenaries in Syria.  Russia is using civilian equipment to get supplies to front lines.

Militaries on the offensive tend to get bogged down at 10 percent casualties,, stagnate at 20 percent and rout at 30 percent.  Russian forces seem to be stalemate across most of the three fronts.  Large numbers of Russian soldiers are abandoning equipment, deserting,  or surrendering.

1219.0,[],False,,Baileythetraveller,,default,[],,,dark,text,t2_jdtxwndg,False,False,"You ask a good question. I’m a former war correspondent and UN official. I spent many years in northern Pakistan/Afghanistan, Jordan, Israel/Palestine, and worked in Ukraine as a Mission Canada electoral observer. I have extensive military and political field experience. I’ve stood against racism my entire life. I fully support Ukraine and its people in their right of self-defence. My heart breaks when I see pictures of Berdyansk where I met so many good people.  
I’ve seen shit, but this war is different. It’s already shattered our world. For what it’s worth…a slightly counter-perspective on the war.  
The international military norm holds that if a super-power invades another country with their own troops, the other super-power can only arm insurgents and support covert strikes. Despite President Zelensky’s eloquent appeals, NATO won’t break that taboo. No air cover. No flagged troops beyond the ubiquitous “advisors”. This norm has held in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Syria.   
But this time, Russia illegally invaded Ukraine and NATO responded by starting the Second Cold War. In 1945, it was the USSR that erected an iron curtain around their territory. In 2022, it’s NATO that is ring-fencing its borders and society — businesses, civil contacts, Internet, sports and culture. For many, this is justified. I tend to agree. Yet, to be clear, it’s still us seizing their property and wealth, a near-complete western exodus from Russia, and the refusal to exchange money and oil on the global banking system.   
The consequence? This shattered the international commerce and travel system. It will continue until there are few contacts left. The West’s decision to leave Russia also meant that Putin can falsely claim that our ideas went with us. Putin has already gone full dictator. US-Them. Thought police. National purity. Mortal sacrifice for the Fatherland. A cult of national death. For Trump. I mean, Putin. 

The consequence? The world now awaits the final decision on war or peace. National trading blocks or international commerce? Despite American or Russian bravado, the future of the world now rests in Chinese hands. Our financial embargo guaranteed that. 

It forces Premier Xi's hand. He can't remain neutral. If he joins Russia, China will get secure oil, an invasion of Taiwan, establish a new global currency, and a cynical solution to domestic economic collapse. If Premier Xi sides with the West, he can isolate Putin and force him to the negotiating table and gain international trade concessions from Washington. China can't stay neutral on this one, and it exposes where power resides. The world order has already shifted.   
The decision to erect a new iron curtain destroyed the intentional trading system, and strategically weakened NATO’s bargaining position vis-a-vis China. That’s a high cost to bear and a dangerous escalation. I hope it works out, I fear it won't.

And despite the bravado of Silicon Valley, the global Internet officially is now dead. It's been fully weaponized, and thus becomes a military necessity to control. National firewalls will be enforced around the globe, and satellites like Starlink have become military targets and signals to be locked. 

What a disaster Putin started. The only silver-lining in this crap is the certainty that one day this will all explode in his face.",56c241a7698a6bc88dc5d4190353327f77ba6fa8,True,False,,,,,0,1647880203,,0,{},i1jpzcu,False,t3_tj8m2w,False,False,t3_tj8m2w,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/tj8m2w/are_there_legitimate_scholarshistorians_without/i1jpzcu/,1647880217,1,False,True,False,UkraineWarReports,t5_5wncl5,r/UkraineWarReports,public,,0,[],,1647851403.0,,,,

Apart from Donesk and Luhansk, which have ever been ukrainian, the nationality of crimea can be very much disputed. Arguably russia has a very strong claim since it has been part of russia for centuries and was only for a time ukrainian because of Khrushchev.  
When Ukraine became independent after the resolution of the USSR, it only retained the Cimea because russia at that time was in disorder and dependent on western financial credits to survive. Many russians see this period as shameful.

&amp;#x200B;

Apart from that, yes, russia is clearly the aggressor and fully accountable for the war and all Atrocities against ukrainians being commited. I won't argue against that. I am just arguing if it was necessary to happen? Was there no solution better than this senseless destruction?  Maybe some sort of ""finlandization"" would have been better for the ukrainian people. Maybe they could have had a treaty with russia, receeding crimea against a withdrawal in Donesk and Luhansk and recognition of their indipendence.  Maybe they should not have been cutting the water supply from crimea making it into a desert. Maybe they should not have been missile bombing donesk and sendung the azov nazi battalions.  


I still don't believe that this aggression by russia would have happened if all these tiny things did not happen. I cannot imagine russia wanting to annex the whole of ukraine. By the time they can do that everybody is dead and it became a wasteland. Same for back home in russia which would be totally isolated and economically collapsed.

Your other points are good and all, and I wouldn't argue that of course Ukraine has, like many other countries, problems inside. Including nazis. What scale that was is not something I can judge in hindsight. I hear a lot of people claim either that media downplayed it or that it wasn't so bad, or that it only started after 2014. I'm certain there would have been peaceful ways out. My family had to flee west to not get killed by Soviets, if there wasn't another way let the Russian minorities flee east and integrate them into Russia if they would prefer Russia. Either way a country having a nazi problem is something the country and people need to solve itself. Imagine Turkey would invade Germany because of discrimination against muslimic minorities. Or China would invade Japan. Mexico the US and so on.

Russia is the aggressor in this. No matter the reasons it presents, no matter if Nato helped escalate it one way or another (I find it, by the way, despicable trying to control anotger sovereign country's alliances, and that goes both ways to Russia and the US) I will not ever argue pro the invasion.",855e8d3bd22e8ea9230083ca9fbe4ec038a2c107,True,False,,,,,0,1647865676,,0,{},i1itfxm,False,t3_tj8m2w,False,True,t1_i1irvnc,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/tj8m2w/are_there_legitimate_scholarshistorians_without/i1itfxm/,1647865692,1,False,True,False,UkraineWarReports,t5_5wncl5,r/UkraineWarReports,public,,0,[],,1647836876.0,,,,

164.0,[],False,,MaksDampf,,default,[],,,dark,text,t2_dmoa8ej9,False,False,"&gt;hought is that in Europe we sincerely worry that if Russia succeeds at clipping off territory from any sovereign state, it will not stop at once. If Nato member states don't act it means we throw not just Ukraine but also Moldova and Finland under the wheels. Finland are so suddenly eager to join Nato not necessarily for military strength, or because USA are so cool, but so that Russia considers twice before invading. They share a huge border with Russia.  
&gt;  
&gt;No support of Ukraine means signaling Russia it can expand and control whatever it wants, up to Nato borders or even beyond.

This creeping theory of a second ""appeasement"" is total BS of war mongerers. If you watched the video, you would hav known that russias intent is most likely not to annex the Ukraine, but to fuck it up seriously as a deterrent. 

Fuck it up so much that nobody in its right sense would attempt to join NATO again (Finland, Armenia, Georgia, etc.) in fear of the same happening to them. But it isn't going to plan. Russias army has nowhere the capabilities to annex anything, not even to conquer ukraine as you have seen. 

And what was seen as a deterrence operation seems to drive countries into the arms of NATO even more. So putin is not getting what he wants, which is a good thing. But its also a bad thing, because russia has no way out now other than to win. If we want to end this war, we have to think more of possible ways out for russia without winning or loosing too much.  
Finland has been safe from russia since the end of WW2 because it would not want to join Nato. Finland was always neutral and the Russians and westerners thought of it as a prime exhibit of successful foreign policy.  Russia has suggested ""finlandization"" of Ukraine several times, even went to the european court of justice because of that.

And about the Nazis in Ukraine and suppressions of russian minorities in all those former soviet union states that broke apart. I hate to tell you that it is real and it is of great concern for russians today to look after their ethnic russian minorities in neighbouring states.  Russians have a lot of Nazis too, most even being allied with Putin, so this de-nazification is clearly BS.

Here's someone respectable with a debatable viewpoint:  John Mearsheimer

He sees this entire thing from a great powers conflict perspective. He thinks that Russia would just naturally not accept an enemy alliance setting up shop at its border, just like the US wouldn't.

That's not entirely wrong, BUT: Putin obviously wants the USSR back, which included Ukraine, so there's obviously more motivation for him than just preserving a buffer state against NATO; and the idea of NATO actually invading Russia for no reason is profoundly silly. I find it difficult to believe that even Putin, despite his famously delusional paranoia, believes this. I imagine he sees the possibility of a NATO attack in response to him bullying his various neighbours; frankly, I don't think it's obvious that we should allow Russia to bully its neighbours.",4b4e0e7d47e947ea0dd4819f765ea01aa8a8dbae,True,False,,,,,0,1647861840,,0,{},i1inbbb,False,t3_tj8m2w,False,True,t3_tj8m2w,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/tj8m2w/are_there_legitimate_scholarshistorians_without/i1inbbb/,1647861854,1,False,True,False,UkraineWarReports,t5_5wncl5,r/UkraineWarReports,public,,0,[],,1647833040.0,,,,

Actually i don't know of any scholars who are critical of ""Nato inaction"" as u/No-Double6415 claims. These so-called analysts are either Journalists, who seem to not know anything the conflicts anamnesis and seem to be heavily pro war just because it is the public opinion. Or they are so called ""security experts"" which means military or weapons industry lobbyist.  
I haven't seen any scholars who want NATO to start a war with russia or provoke anything like that. Actually some of them are silently criticizing NATOs increasingly non-neutral actions such as supplying more and more weapons to the warzone, Ewacs support, drones etc.  
I think the public opinion rallies very much to the idea that we must help ukraine militarily, not realizing that this means a nuclear world war. This has caught politicians in europe by surprise, who know the idiocrisy of such an act militarily and from a humanitarian view. If we are in a nuclear war it is of no value to claim that ""you weren't the one who started it"", everybody just looses.  
I would not be surprised if the aftermath shows that western journalism and ideology in Europe was in some effect influenced by a very successful CIA operation. Sure, ideology wise Europe was already very close to the current line, but think of it: It is in the US interest to destroy the economical relationship of Europe with Russia. Europe has very few Ressources and only with Russias Gas, Oil and Ressources could it become more independent of American Influence. They did not want that to happen and so they provoked putin whenever they could.  Ukraine may be just the pawn sacrifice of the CIA. How cynical that they now pretend to help to defend Ukraine.   
But hat is highly speculative on my part and probably overstating CIAs capabilities. I just think it makes sense considering their objectives if they pursued such a strategy.",d67895747a8f5aa65b935d56651acbcdd667818a,True,False,,,,,0,1647861661,,0,{},i1in22e,False,t3_tj8m2w,False,True,t3_tj8m2w,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/tj8m2w/are_there_legitimate_scholarshistorians_without/i1in22e/,1647861677,1,False,True,False,UkraineWarReports,t5_5wncl5,r/UkraineWarReports,public,,0,[],,1647832861.0,,,,
