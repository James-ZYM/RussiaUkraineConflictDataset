As far as the 1990s, I think the strategy for the US and the West was cautiousness. Certainly the US and NATO would have preferred warmer relations with Russia and you are correct that Russia was temporarily weakened and not nearly as powerful as the former Soviet Union, that said there were valid concerns that a resurgent Russia could dominate its neighbors in the future. Obviously former Warsaw Pact countries were concerned about this occurring and were eager to join NATO. 

With respect to security for Eastern Europe and the Baltics - partnerships and warmer relations with Russia are important but they are not as secure as a defensive military alliance. I am not discounting diplomacy and trying to foster good international relationships, but from a security perspective those are not concrete and can change with time. You could have easily made the same argument about Ukraine prior to 2014 - Ukraine shared history, linguistics, and political ties with Russia. They were very close with Russia....until they weren't. Can we really say with confidence that if NATO hadn't expanded in the 90s, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania wouldn't be experiencing the same situation we're witnessing in Ukraine right now? Furthermore, why are non-NATO countries close to Russia such as Finland and Sweden scrambling to join Nato? If they are not a part of NATO currently (and thus not a security threat to Russia), why do they feel the urgent need to join NATO? And I agree with you that Ukraine got the worst of both worlds, a lukewarm reception to potential NATO membership that didn't give them any security guarantees but alarmed Russia. 

As far as Cuban Missile Crisis, my point was it was a different period of time with different circumstances. With respect to Fidel Castro, I never said that he didn't have some popular support, just that it is difficult for any dictator to ""represent"" the will of the people without a representative government. I mean the Kim family in North Korea have controlled that country for almost 80 years, and I'm sure they have some amount of popular support due to the propoganda and strict control of the news. Are Kim Jong Un's decisions the North Korean peoples ""will?"" I would argue no, and especially not if the North Korean people had full information and knew and could pick the potential alternatives themselves.

With respect to the scenario of Mexico joining an alliance with China - I agree the US wouldn't be very happy. I don't think it would necessarily lead to an invasion unless China was clearly staging a build up of forces for an invasion of the US. I mean, this is kind of the situation in the Zimmerman telegram in WW1. The point I would make is that a democratically elected government in Mexico would never need to join a defensive alliance with China because Mexico will always benefit far more with good relations with the US and isn't threatened by the prospect of US invasion and annexation of its territory.

In actuality, Putin's goal is to ""subsume"" the historical Kievan Rus under Moscow's banner as to complete the Russian Mythology, consequently strengthening Russia's identity for the purpose of holding the federation together. 

Western Russia's relationship with Eastern Russia (Siberia and the Far East) is quite similar to the one that existed between Imperial Spain and Latin America prior to the latter's revolutions, where you have one geographical region dictating over another despite being inhabited by the same ethnic people. Siberia itself can in some ways be compared with Australia as a massive and desolate region that has historically served as a penal colony.

Why couldn't we have had good relations with Russia? Everyone across the political spectrum in Russia, from Gorbachev to Yeltsin to Putin, was opposed to NATO expansion, and we continually ignored their concerns. 

And yes, the Eastern European countries wanted to join NATO because of an understandably heightened perception of the threat from Russia, due to their bad history. But as an observer from afar, the US should have had the wisdom to realize that post-Soviet Russia, with an economy and military in shambles, posed no immediate threat to those countries. Bill Clinton should have realized, as many observers like George Kennan perceptively pointed out at the time like, that Russia would only see NATO expansion as a humiliation, as the US taking advantage of Russian weakness. It's exactly how the Germans saw the Treaty of Versailles–it doesn't justify the actions of the Nazis, but it does let you understand their grievances. 

We had alternative security arrangements, like the Partnership for Peace which included Russia, but we thought we could get away with NATO expansion since, well, Russia was way too weak to do anything about it. Keeping up friendly relations with Russia may have given Eastern Europe the security it desired without turning the largest nuclear power into a vengeful foe. 

&gt;With respect to Cuba, I think an authoritarian strongman who represses their population is less representative of the ""will"" of Cuba then a democratically elected government in Ukraine with the majority of the population desiring closer ties to the West.

This seems more naive than anything I said. The communists did and still do have popular support for their anti-US agenda. That's how they've been able to last decades longer than many of their communist counterparts. Of course, there's no problem if Ukraine wants closer ties to the West, we should encourage that. The mistake was the US offering NATO membership when everyone else in the room knew that was a bad idea, most of all for the Ukrainians. 

And no, I don't see bringing up Cuba as ""whataboutism."" It's a good way to jolt Westerners out of their preconceived notions and engage in ""strategic empathy,"" i.e. seeing events through the eyes of the other side. For instance, how do you think the US would react if Mexico tried to join a military alliance led by China? I will tell you, they would certainly not take too kindly to it.

There are many mathematical formulas that discribe specific aspects of technological advancement over time. The curve you find simplistic is based on observation and isn't a straight upward trend, but if you look at the available data, then despite its complexity in the micro level, the macro trends are there.

A single cell in an organism is highly complex in its function, yet there are simple mathematical formulas that can predict behavior of a cell without taking into account every single individual reaction that takes place within a cell. This kind of mathematics is used widely and successfully in for example pharmaceutical science.

&gt; Why did the chinese have so many more technolgies than the Europeans and still lagged behind?

Lagged behind in what? And when? Are we talking about the industrial revolution? 

&gt; Why did we stop going to the space after we were on the moon?

We didn't stop, from GPS to remote sensing space has been a busy place since the first break of the atmosphere. The reason we didn't go to other planets or moons is that it no longer played a part in the cold war as a PR competition. So while the scientific community wanted to go on, the political community didn't see short term gain so they blocked funding. Of course this is a simplification, but that is what it comes down to. 

In the meantime space exploration is a single metric for technological and scientific advancement, as you say humanity is complex, but while space exploration got cut, space exploitation hasn't, again GPS is an example. And let's not forget that acces to space hasn't even been around for even a hundred years yet.

[],False,,EqualContact,,,[],,,,text,t2_32d1pm2y,False,False,"&gt;But is there really nothing to say about Russia's (genuine) fear of attack by foreign powers all over its borders? 

NATO is not going to attack Russia. Setting aside whether or not the alliance is defensive in nature (it doesn't really matter), the reason no one has attacked them since the 1950s is nuclear weapons. It doesn't matter how many NATO countries they border or the size of their military, invading Russia is a non-starter and everyone but Russia seems to realize this. The fact that the Russian Army is taking significant losses right now but their borders remain unthreatened in any meaningful way proves this.

Furthermore, there is little certainty that controlling eastern Europe would make Russia any more or less secure. A conventional force from the US *alone* would easily defeat Russia right now whether they started from positions on the Dnieper or the Rhine. Russia is utterly hopeless against western militaries anyways—and this is where the author sees Russia's conceit. Russia doesn't want to seek security and stability with a greater power as Poland or Romania do, or with an alliance of equals as France and Germany have done. No, Russia wants to do things on their own terms in spite of their glaringly obvious ability to do so.

&gt;Whatever aspirations it has to become a ""great power"" surely is superseded by the Russian paranoia of being invaded, and thus the need to counteract a potential invasion.

They are seeking a ""Great Power"" solution to their fear rather than one that is actually practical and achievable. Just as Western European countries needed to get over the fact that they could no longer dictate the course of the world alone, so to Russia needs to grapple with the fact that it can't solve its security concerns through force of arms or belligerency. The UK and France dealt with this by building stronger ties with the US and each other. Germany on the other hand lashed out in the 1930s, refusing to accept that it wasn't the dominant power of the world until it suffered a total defeat on the battlefield. Germany eventually solved its security concerns through union with its neighbors. 

&gt;The West is viewing and acting vis-a-vis Russia in the same way as it had done for the past 200 years. 

I don't know how you can look at the past 30 years of history and come to that conclusion. NATO went out of its way to address Russia's concerns, constantly tolerated its belligerent behavior, and ignored its increasing illiberalism and blatant attempts to manipulate their own publics for a very long time. If there's a consistency to the relationship between the West and Russia over the past 200 years, it's fear and disgust of Russia's totalitarianism. The hope that the West has held onto since 1991 was that Russia was finally progressing beyond this.",4c692c5d837ac0174aa13df409a6df4ea5b7b073,True,False,,,,,0,1649440351,,0,{},i3xh24g,False,t3_tz4obi,False,True,t1_i3wyc94,/r/geopolitics/comments/tz4obi/stephen_kotkin_the_cold_war_never_ended/i3xh24g/,1649440369,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649411551.0,

Can't it be admitted that Russia could have chosen to do so if NATO had not moved eastward, toward its borders? I mean, Kotkin is saying here is ridiculous: how could Russia ""choose instead to live alongside"" the West, when the West is moving its military hardware ever closer to it? And to define the Russian mindset as the search for great-power reputation also sounds ridiculous. It's like trying to understand the Americans by explaining their actions through reference to Manifest Destiny. This sounds more like myth than reality. Sure the Russians are proud of their identity and history, and the imperial successes of their past (which country with such history is NOT), and thus has a hard time accepting their diminution from its formerly high and lofty status (which country would have an easy time with this?!). But is there really nothing to say about Russia's (genuine) fear of attack by foreign powers all over its borders? Whatever aspirations it has to become a ""great power"" surely is superseded by the Russian paranoia of being invaded, and thus the need to counteract a potential invasion. I don't see this as illegitimate at all. And how is this any different from what ANY other state does when it claims that it is doing something for the sake of ""national security"", including the US? But no, apparently we cannot accept what the Russians are doing as anything other than the will of a despot. While Kotkin talks much about how the Russians have not changes since Stalin, he really should also say that the West hasn't changed either. The West is viewing and acting vis-a-vis Russia in the same way as it had done for the past 200 years. NO ONE is changing here, and that is why we have the same recurring problems still.",267ffa19868f3c1f577ec32adf201d009f76d3dd,True,False,,,,,0,1649433295,,0,{},i3wyc94,False,t3_tz4obi,False,True,t3_tz4obi,/r/geopolitics/comments/tz4obi/stephen_kotkin_the_cold_war_never_ended/i3wyc94/,1649433307,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649404495.0,

[],False,,gudtoomes,,,[],,,,text,t2_8nfi29k9,False,False,"At a core level the idea that the cold war never ended isn't wrong because the major powers involved have always refused the 'peaceful'/'adult' solution. 

The longer run cold war can essentially be reduced to a war between the US and Russia over 'control' of Europe, one that the US has always been winning obviously but still. The US (330 million population) is big. Russia is smaller but still respectably 'big' (144 million, importantly much bigger than the larger EU countries) and much closer. Europe as a whole is also big BUT europe is far more split and divided.

The peaceful solution to the 'cold' war is that Russia is allowed to join the EU (something that Russia has been willing to do in the past), and all 3 parties, the US, EU and Russia get along and develop together. The **problem** is that Russia is too big to be allowed into the EU. It's potential influence if it was allowed into the bloc is too large. If Russia joins the EU, overtime it would slowly develop a lot of influence and likely push the EU towards certain directions and actions.

This is a threat to the US as it's leadership in the region would be threatened. An EU with Russia in it could easily override the US's desires, and in fact probably would. So basically, Russia cannot be allowed in from their perspective. The other major EU powers are ambivalent and unsure, there is a basic lack of unity - some countries think maybe Russia could be 'fixed' in the longer run and allowed in the future, others feel threatened by Russia, others don't care enough to care and so on, while others more US friendly openly push against the motion - so the current status quo exists, where Russia is locked out.

At the same time, Russia would like to be in the EU as Russia's territory is too large for it's population, hence it feels vulnerable, and would benefit from having it's left flank much more secure, but recognizes it wont be allowed in, but as a consequence perceives NATO as a threat.

Point is, the longer run 'cold war' is pretty much pointless and the conflict can be reduced to a childish school playground popularity contest.",38edb3f5df02cd967ead9ab2d193f72b511e4684,True,False,,,,,0,1649432998,,0,{},i3wxjxw,False,t3_tz4obi,False,False,t3_tz4obi,/r/geopolitics/comments/tz4obi/stephen_kotkin_the_cold_war_never_ended/i3wxjxw/,1649433010,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649404198.0,

""Many Russians view their country as a providential power, with a distinct civilization and a special mission in the world, but Russia’s capabilities do not match its aspirations, and so its rulers resort, time and again, to a hyperconcentration of power in the state in a coercive effort to close the yawning gap with the West. But the drive for a strong state does not work, invariably devolving into personalist rule. The combination of weakness and grandeur, in turn, drives the autocrat to exacerbate the very problem that facilitated his appearance. After 1991, when the gap with the West widened radically, Russia’s perpetual geopolitics endured, as I argued in these pages in 2016. It will persist until Russian rulers make the strategic choice to abandon the impossible quest to become a great-power equal of the West and choose instead to live alongside it and focus on Russia’s internal development.  
All of this explains why the original Cold War’s end was a mirage. The events of 1989–91 were consequential, just not as consequential as most observers—myself included—took them to be. During those years, Germany reunified within the transatlantic alliance, and Russian power suffered a sharp temporary reduction—outcomes that, with Moscow’s subsequent withdrawal of troops, freed up small eastern European countries to adopt democratic constitutional orders and market economies and join the West in the EU and NATO. Those events transformed the lives of the people in the countries between Germany and Russia and in those two historical frenemies themselves, but they changed the world far less. A reunified Germany largely remained a nonfactor geopolitically, at least until the weeks after the invasion of Ukraine, when Berlin adopted a far more assertive posture, at least for the moment. Parts of eastern Europe, such as Hungary and Poland, which happened to be among the biggest losers in the world wars and their peace settlements, started to show illiberal streaks and in this way confirmed limitations in the EU’s framework. Although the radical diminution in the size of the Russian state has mostly held (so far), the collapse of Russian power was hardly permanent, just as it was not after the Treaty of Versailles of 1919. The West’s relatively brief respite from great-power competition with Russia constituted a historical blink of an eye.""

&gt;On the black market, it takes 35 to 40 rubles to match one U.S. dollar. In limited auctions run by the government for foreign companies, a dollar has sold for 45 to 70 rubles. This brings the value of the ruble well below the Indian rupee, Philippine peso or Thai baht.  
But the government pretends that the ruble is worthy of a superpower; the commercial exchange rate is 1.75 rubles to the dollar and the rarely used official exchange rate is 0.58 rubles to the dollar. Tourists, however, can obtain a more realistic 32 rubles for a dollar. All rates are fixed.  
The multiple exchange rates have a sort of looking-glass effect on all prices, making it difficult to figure out what anything is worth, especially for Soviet citizens who earn an average of about 500 rubles a month.",0afd68b958853a20fc93a522de37483d63eaa109,True,False,,,,,0,1649426325,,0,{},i3wgcy8,False,t3_t0cgvt,False,True,t1_i3uyy2o,/r/geopolitics/comments/t0cgvt/ukraine_megathread_all_new_posts_go_here_so_long/i3wgcy8/,1649426338,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649397525.0,

I am talking specifically about modern colonization. Africa was about 5 centuries behind European technology.

It already started with the late medieval time and intensified in the enlightenment. I would set the beginning of Europes rise in the 14th century, so around 1350. That intensified in the renaissance, was shook in the religious struggles, awoke during the enlightenment, and shot through the roof with the industrial revolutions.

The invention of gunpowder is a cool thing, but nobody utilized it to the extend the europeans did, nobody was so innovative, nobody built their militaries around it like the europeans. There is a massive difference between invention and innovation. The greek and egyptions invented steam power, but they never used it properly. Therefore the ones rightfully credited with the steampower innovation are the English.

The middle East was of course more advanced than Europe, but so what? I never said anything otherwise. Also, we are not talking about the brief colonization of the middle east, but more of the colonization of the Americas, Southeast Asia and Africa. It is indian numbers and they are just a different alphabet for numbers plus the nice idea of actually writing 0 instead of leaving the spot empy like the romans and also Greek i believe did.

It is hard to produce high tech goods cheaply and effectively in poor, not innovative, business-hostile and instable countries. Europe is not producing microchips because TSMC is so damn good at it and just outcompetes others. Is Europe being colonized by Taiwan? No. Also, you are overlooking that capitalism is finally bearing fruit in africa and africa is using it's young and cheap labour to pull itself out of the dirt (because country can pull another country out of the dirt) and they are building better societal and political structures and a more business-friendly environment with many startups. It is possible that the next century will be known as the african century.

Because the question is about the governmental system and the international order. If you put an unfit and a fit person on a racing track, is the race rigged agains the unfit person? No it is not. The unfit person will loose and after a lot of training sweat and tears the unfit person will be fit and can then compete on equal terms, but that doesn't mean the race was rigged the first time.

Capitalism is the only thing that really works and with slight general governmental regulations such as the carbon tax (to avoid externalization of environmental costs) and the actual neccessity to be more sustainable, it will be with us for a long time or maybe always.

Something to add would be the little point they touched upon, where European Companies use Kazakhstan as a middle-man to trade with Russia, this is a key aspect to Kazakhstan abstaining from the reactions, both for and against by the West in relation to the Russian/Ukrainian conflict. 

What the article didn't mention was the vice-versa arrangement, where Russian corporations also set up in Kazakhstan to trade with the west. This became common practice in the post-2014 sanctions environment and Kazakhstan profits from this arrangement, as the mutual trade agreements and infrustructure in place make it very easy for companies registered in both jurisdictions to handle cross-border trade and corporate structuring.

&gt;Interviewer: How long do we think this conflict goes? I know that's impossible to predict but any guesses?  
&gt;  
&gt;Zeihan: If you had asked me 5 years ago I would say he would have captured Kyiv in less than a month and the whole country in less than three. Now I'm thinking that the whole country will certainly fall in less than six but one of the characteristics of the civilian obliteration program that the Russians are launching is that it's not quick. It will take several weeks to reduce cities the size of Kyiv and Kharkiv to rubble - that's a lot of ordinance and the number of troops he has in Ukraine is wildly insufficient for that task. So you should expect - in fact I think we are seeing troop movements within Russia proper - moving many, many, many more forces to the border and we'll probably have a million Russian soldiers within Ukraine by the end of the year.

I think this is crazy take and I'm not sure what troop movements he's talking about. I don't think Zeihan must have updated his priors about the state of the Russian military and their ability to provide logistics for a million troops.

&gt;I think we're just going to disagree about some things.

Fair enough, that's fine. I enjoy how we're being respectful while still disagreeing.

&gt;actually think that American influence at Versailles is rather overrated. The UK and France were the two most important players there, and the US was unable to convince them to adhere to his 14 points plan, much to the chagrin of Germany. The points he was most successful at obtaining were those that the British already supported, and the League of Nations was really they only loftier goal that was achieved—which the US then refused to join.

I think that the US being a superpower does not mean there aren't any other superpowers. France and the UK were at the time superpowers and it's not surprising that America's negotiations had limits when confronted with opposition from other superpowers.

The point is that the US was able to modify these issues and convince European powers to adhere to certain issues that the US proposed (even if the US was a bit flaky at times)

&gt;Perhaps they considered Chinese self-government a necessary evil, but my point is merely that they had to acknowledge the reality of the situation. It was still imperialistic, but they realized their goals could not be as lofty as they had hoped in the previous decade. I call this progress in favor of China, albeit only the beginnings of it.

I do respect your interpretation of it and to be sure, an United China is preferable to a divided China. However, I still stick with my initial viewpoint that their mindset of exploitation hasn't changed but instead has become more effective and that is, in my view, a strengthening of the imperialism conducted in China.

&gt;in the core of China than they had up to that point

Sure but I think we would have to question whether European powers even wanted the core Han regions. Was it that they wanted territories of China or was it that they wanted resources or perhaps a market?

I think the dichotomy of Tibet being part of the Great Game and the nondisturbance of the core Han regions only serves to promote the idea that these European powers chose how to treat Chinese regions based on what they wanted to exploit. If they wanted Tibet's resources, they would interfere in Tibet. But if they wanted a market, they would market to Han regions.

Honestly, I think we're saying the same thing but focusing on two different things which is fine.

&gt;To put it another way: I think the aftermath First Sino-Japanese War was the lowest point for China. Things still had a long ways to go after the Boxer Rebellion, but it was in some ways an improvement.

From my point of view, the Boxer Rebellion is not an improvement in any sense because it was an imperialistic move that ignored Chinese sovereignty. 

The fact that it was not *as bad* as the First Sino Japanese war does not automatically mean it was an improvement for China.

&gt;When Japan invaded in 1937, the Roosevelt cheated the Neutrality Act to keep supplying China with weapons (the war was not formally declared), and instituted embargoes on various products that eventually resulted in the oil embargo that spurred the Pearl Harbor attack.

Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe the US only started supplying after the Land Lease Act of 1941? 

And the embargos was largely in reaction to Japanese invasions of French Indochina, not because of the Japanese invasion of China. As such, I don't believe we can use the embargos as evidence of US trying to support China. I do believe the US did start supporting China but that was because Japan attacked a European colonial power and China was a useful proxy with which to fight Japan with.",9fe1512c42dfd377b83ad30092ccc191cef398f4,True,False,,,,,0,1649385994,,0,{},i3um4tr,False,t3_txmq2k,False,True,t1_i3t8sc0,/r/geopolitics/comments/txmq2k/the_price_of_hegemony_can_america_learn_to_use/i3um4tr/,1649386008,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649357194.0,
