Bessarrabia, the Romanian name for the region that makes up the largest portion of modern Moldova and is heavily populated by Romanians, was rewarded to Romania for being on the winning side of WW1 but Russia demanded Romania hand it over as WW2 broke out. (Sound familiar?) Romania got angry so joined the Axis so they could fight Russia and get it back. That didn't pan out, well, eh, and Russia took it back after ww2.

Stalin made it a Soviet Republic but Stalin also did not want Moldova (or any other republic) to be separatist threat so he sent hundreds of thousands of locals to Siberia, work camps, etc. where they and their progeny live out second-class existences. Meanwhile, Stalin trucked in poor Russians, minor political opponents, people who'd looked him wrong etc. into Moldova to re-populate it. But, also, he re-drew the border of Moldova east of the Dniestr River to accommodate a chunk of whatbhad been Ukraine.(Bet they loved that, eh.) This force-inergrated the future of Romanian, Ukrainian and Russian ethnic peoples and cultures. So clever, Stalin, you monster. But there is more! Stalin invested heavily in the industrialization and militarization of the tiny Ukrainian slice of the republic, which we know as Transniestria, so that is where all the power and wealth was accumulated while the more Romanian portion to the west remained more agrarian. (Seriously, if you go there now you won't be surprised to see horse-drawn carts, hand-piled haystacks, etc. as people carry own ""peasant"" traditions except they have flat screen TVs and mobile phone. It's like an alternate reality.)

So the Soviet Union falls apart but how is Moldova going to fall? The ethnic Ukrainians want it to join Ukraine, Romanians to Romania, and Russians to Russia. Romanians have the land, Ukrainians have the wealth, Russians have the military and political clout. The majority Romanians start to lean toward Romania as Romanians look toward the EU but also see a nationalist resurgence after their own release from authoritarian leadership under Nicolae Ceasescu.

Russians and Russia don't want to lose Bessarabia but their military and political power is collapsing, too. So they send in a small troop of well-armed ""peacekeepers"" which in effect create breakaway Republic within Moldova--one country with a river dividing it. This creates a wedge issue within Moldova and by wielding softpower and bribes Russia has managed to keep Moldova corrupt, impoverished, divided and politically gridlock (loke China does with North Korea, sans a despot) even as Romania has flourished as an member--or just affiliate? I don't recall it's current status--of the EU and member of NATO. Recently, transniestria has been losing population as any Russian or Ukrainian passport holder or historical native who has better options has fled. Politcal power has begun again tilting toward Romania and the EU.

What's next? Is Moldova a domino that would fall with Ukraine or might it be a fallback plan for Putin if he loses in Ukraine? Moldova and Georgia are watching all this play out with great anxiety, as their futures are tied up in Ukraine's. Interestingly, Ukraine is Moldova's big, tough neighbor just as Russia is Ukraine's. Ukraine was no friend to independent Moldova when the war there broke and if Russia hadn't intervened might have taken the transniestrian region for it's own. So while I very much appreciate what Zhelensky and Ukraine are doing to stand up for their national integrity, I do hope their nationalists do some soul searching about their own past.

If any of these countries want to join the EU and NATO, those organizations will surely want the territorial issues are worked out first. Heck, I wouldn't be surprised to Romania and Hungry go to war someday over Transylvania, especially if Orban pulls a Putin and decides an invasion mightbprovide a ratings boost. lol.

We did nothing. Russia not so quietly moved weapons, missile systems, and tanks into the Donbas, the eastern region of Ukraine. We stood back and watched; we were already caught up in ISIS and Afghanistan, but we could have helped then. But we assumed your attitude. Your callous attitude, and I am ashamed for our nation.

Now look where we are. Look where Ukraine is. If we and our allies cannot come together and support an invaded sovereign nation building a democratic society that enjoys freedom of speech, freedom of movement, all the things we enjoy, it won’t just be Ukraine and the freedom we and most of Europe enjoys.

If Ukraine falls, Russia will go after the Baltics. Look at a map. Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia are next. These are our allies. Then NATO and the US are in it up to our ears. Then Finland will be in Russia’s crosshairs. So will Sweden. Norway, too. These are our allies. Putin has already said that Finland and Sweden joining NATO would be tantamount to declaring war. Look at a map. Poland is also in Russia’s crosshairs. They are our allies.

Finland is in the process of filing to join NATO. They will be accepted. They are part of the EU. They have a robust military that regularly runs war games with NATO and the US. They have the necessary military hardware. What’s Putin’s move then?

None of these countries lives in a fish bowl, immune to what happens the next bowl over. We, the United States, are hand-in-hand with Europe. What happens in Ukraine happens to Europe. As President Zelenskyy says, again and again, “if we fall, so do you”.

FFS, where is your heart? Are you watching what’s happening, or are you just sitting back nice and comfortable in your own bubble of contentment? You, and people who think like you, need a slap of reality. If Ukraine goes down, Europe goes up in flames and we are at war. Another World War. So, now what? You think two oceans will stop intercontinental missiles? Nope. Now, what? Have you even thought that far?

I have. Though I live on a small, fixed income I have tightened up here and there so I am able to donate funds each month to charities supporting Ukrainian refugees, and the elderly, sick, and disabled who cannot get out. This month my donation goes to help Ukrainian animals necessarily left behind. It makes life a squeeze for me. That is NOTHING compared to the suffering Ukrainians. I could not live with myself if I didn’t help them in my small way. Everything helps, no matter how small. I could not live with myself if I didn’t urge my House Rep and my Senators to do everything in their power to give Ukraine what it needs to survive. NOW. How will you live with yourself if Ukraine falls?",cb33709186e0b525b2aa45093e29c3290dce56ce,True,False,,,,,0,1649448396,,0,{},i3y1on7,False,t3_tz7p78,False,True,t1_i3xirwq,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tz7p78/why_should_americans_care_about_ukraine_bucha/i3y1on7/,1649448414,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1649419596.0,,,,

That is only correct because they won't let East regions be sovereign in a democratic way. It doesn't matter what you think about the separatists that were there during the decision, if they weren't there the referendum wouldn't be allowed to happen and that also wouldn't be democratic, would it?

I think to have a right of bombing civilians just because they are or you want them to be your citizens is insane and that rethoric should be challenged waaay before Russians decided to stop it by themselves.

""all the killing will end if you just let us eliminate your nation and everyone in our way as quick as possible"" 

Again this is only correct if you think everyone in Ukraine is fascist. This is how supposedly Russia thinks if we ask the west, but in this case Ukraine would count civilian casualties in hundred thousands instead of in hundreds.

Honestly theres probably elements of anarchism and heritage that essentially were very appealing to various non political cultural phenomenon that crossed paths in various communities throughout history. 

Take say for example the cross over of new age mysticism in communes which were philosophically or at least interpreted as aligned with anarchist ideas.

Because so much of the pseudo mysticism is based off narcissistic mythical individualism, I think that goes hand in hand with certain areas of ""anarchist culture"" essentially turning into a vague set of highly ambiguous, yet apparently communally aligned, personal principles.

Alot of these people are more likely libertarians but dont even realise it because they don't even understand what anarchism is.

There's even a new video of Ukraine troops ambushing a T-72 column with a 30mm autocannon from an armored unit (almost certainly an APC) if its really recent and from the city - it means Ukraine still has armored units functioning in the city - which is a really good sign.   
The loss of downtown Mariupol is not good news but its not too bad either. In urban combat when faced with a superior force (in this case Russia has more men, armor and supplies in the Mariupol area), you use your fortifications to inflict casualties until Russia can bring their artillery and tanks to bear on your location - but before that happens you disappear to another building. Fortify, ambush, relocate, repeat. Russia in turn, will keep moving troops forward in the city in an effort to minimize the locations Ukraine troops can re-position to.   
When a unit begins to run out of room to reposition it either finds a weakness in the surrounding troops and attacks there to breakout into a less secured section of the city or it finds a highly defensible position and digs in and fights as long as it can.  
It does appear at least two large groups of Ukrainian troops have dug into their possibly final positions.   
The Azovstal steel works (pic 2) in the SE of the city - honestly a great position - protected by open water to the south and the Kalmius river to the west and north. The factory itself is incredibly hardened by the nature of it design as a steel works. It should do a good job protecting the troops inside from artillery - and its a massive complex with multiple levels - its going to require Russia to assault it with infantry or cut it off and try to starve them out. If you study the siege of Stalingrad from World War II - Russian troops dug into the tractor factory and grain towner and held the German forces off for weeks - German infantry had to clear each office and work area inch by inch. I've worked the offices of an old school steel plant (not the new mini-mill ones) and they are just thick hunks of metal and concrete.  
SW of the city another large Ukraine unit appears to have settled into the port (Pic 3), while not as defensible as the the steel works, it would be loaded with supplies particularly food which means it removes supply issues or it could be securing supplies for other units in the city. And the warehouses and storage facilities do offer very good concealment.  
Most analysts are not expecting Mairupol to hold out for more than a few days at this point - but I'm less sure.",f53858a9908f8b77cdb753343ec0fa40faa11a63,True,False,,,,,0,1649396739,,0,{},i3v5ujn,True,t3_tywka9,False,True,t3_tywka9,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tywka9/mariupol_steel_works_and_port_likely_final/i3v5ujn/,1649396756,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1649367939.0,,,,

For instance two opposing Christian sub types, presumably prayed to the same God, and went out and killed eachother. Shia and Sunni, same thing. We can look to which sides won and say God was with them and not the other side, but generally have committed the same acts. I won't ignore the fact that sometimes the defending side had no choice, and chose to defend themselves. Who can blame them, but usually somewhere along the way, they lose their way too.

It illustrates that man is hardly qualified to rule other men, and we should hope that there is a powerful entity coming to save us and establish sovereignty in a way that is just and fair because if not, it's not looking like these problems are within man's grasp to fix.

Not because we aren't capable or smart enough. It's because we are essentially still just a bunch of warring tribes. A house divided cannot stand, so by default it's out of our hands.

Imagine if all the money and effort worldwide spent on war was spent on truly solving our problems, breezing past the red tape and avoiding the sticky fingers of corruption to achieve great things.

The treaties that established NATO are legally binding. They establish very clearly that the only way for NATO to act the way you describe is in the event of an attack on a member state.

Attacks on non member states have zero bearing. 

The individual countries in NATO could decide to attack if they wanted but doing that eliminates them from the alliance and no other NATO nations are required to support them. 

All this talk about NATO.should punish Russia is pointless. NATO is not the UN. It is up to the UN to act. And the UN can't because Russia has veto power on the Security Council. 

There is no other multinational alliance out there that is even remotely involved in this conflict. So it is strictly between Russia and Ukraine.
