The seeker tracks the missile, either the hot exhaust from its rocket motor or often flares attached to the missile airframe, and measures the angle between the missile and the centerline of the operator's sights.”

You ended it right before this: ""This signal is sent to the missile, often using thin metal wires or a radio link, which causes it to steer back towards the center of the line-of-sight.""

The next paragraph at your link starts ""Another class of SACLOS weapons is based on the beam riding principle.""  Thus, flares on the wire or radio-guided, no flares on beam riders.

&gt;The missile doesn’t have to be itself in charge of working out how to ride the beam. A missile can be made more cheaply if you remove the optics that would normally face backwards and detect the beam and replace them with flares or hot exhaust, which can then be tracked by the launcher instead and allow for radio guidance. This is a bit more similar to how really old-school SAM systems work.

One only thinks this if one is very short sighted and can't see the whole map, or believes the Belgorod is The Center of All Russian Industry, Manufacturing and Fuel Refining Capacity. Belgorod is a find distribution hub, but if you recognize that it simply feeds off of larger hubs, and look at where those hubs are, it isn't particularly essential unless the Russians were prioritizing Kharkiv, which they clearly no longer are. Possibly Izyum is still being significantly supplied via Belgorod-Vovchansk, but if the larger hub that feeds that route is Vorenezh (which seems reasonable, as this is the closest major city to any of this) then it is just as short (or even a little more direct) to supply via Valukyi on absolutely secure lines (rail and road) that are within Russia and firmly Russian held territory.

The whole Great Kharkiv Advance, while apparently real, seems like it is being milked as hard as possible for propaganda. Staryi Saltiv was liberated on Reddit nearly three weeks ago now, and so far there has been no impact from it, but we are still hearing about this impactful break through. The whole Kharkiv thing really just looks like Ukrainians ""taking control"" of areas that are no longer of high priority, and if they had potentially high impact they would be more contested than they appear to be.",92dac4f7106d36da9ac29b48830aac7e5d15230c,True,True,,,,,0,1653086957,,0,{},i9dxavp,False,t3_uu5m7q,False,True,t1_i9dlkw1,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uu5m7q/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_52122/i9dxavp/,1653086971,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653058157.0,

Their doctrinal shift to an active defense strategy was a good one. What do you need with an expeditionary force for?

As for the drive on Kyiv, my thinking was drive the right flank units down the P56/P59 route while using the reservoir as the blocking position that can go unguarded. The ME comes down the M1 with follow on forces close behind. Each formation will go on ammo and other supplies until they are out. This should be enough fuel and ammo to make it to the airport. The left flank comes down the H28 at best possible speed making for the M3 and crossing in its bridges. 

As each unit expends 90% of their ammo they become the scouts and bypass strong points and leave them for the fresh follow on forces. The cargo aircraft should make drops of ammo at 1 point along each major line of March and then at the airport, progressively. In this way, resupply chains are not needed in the first few hours and can help free up the roads. 

My point is that the front can be 50-75 miles wide, but 500? No thanks. (Of course this assumes basic combat competency such that the armor can ignore their buddies getting hit and keep pressing on, and the pilots being able to drop somewhere near their resupply points)

Every single government uses propaganda and it only gets worse during a war. On the other hand a country with a free press that gives people the freedom of speech to attack that propaganda when they see it is fundamentally different than a country which forbids protest and punishes anyone who speaks out against that propaganda. However even countries with enshrined personal freedoms still tends to restrict them during war time or at least discourage them to the point where going against government propaganda comes with at the least the ire of your fellow citizens or outright punishment.

When a country is at war it shows just shows how easily those personal protections can be overridden if a society generally ""agrees"" on something but as we see in so many states that slide towards personal repression it can happen anywhere at any time, you always have to be on guard. To think that it could never happen where you live is a fundamental mistake, a potentially fatal one.

That's one of the reasons I really like this old informational film called [Don't Be a Sucker](https://youtu.be/vGAqYNFQdZ4?t=124) from 1943 made in the US, it clearly gives the message you should always be careful when people offer you great things as there will always be an ulterior motive. Sure it's all rah rah America, unsurprisingly, but the message applies to all governments everywhere and I feel like the people who made the film knew that and just put in some of the ""gee isn't America so great"" stuff to try and make it look like they certainly didn't mean to include the US government even though the message is unambiguous, don't be a sucker!",2cd21ffa7e29b633c3a4afc6561ad48568b943cd,True,False,,,,,0,1653082223,,0,{},i9dnd48,False,t3_utrhl1,False,True,t1_i9ch2dw,/r/CombatFootage/comments/utrhl1/loud_german_infantry_combat_footage_near_the_end/i9dnd48/,1653082249,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653053423.0,

&amp;#x200B;

The main problem was that the generals didn't have much options, they knew what the weapons could do they fielded, they weren't dumb, but it's not as if you can just train a couple of million men in a bunch of weeks to conduct modern warfare without knowing how that should even look.

Another big problem was that arms advanced while communications were still very poor, they had to use wire that was essentially bombed the minute it was placed, pigeons or runners. So a General ordered an attack and due to artillery being advanced had to sit 30km behind frontlines and wait for someone to bring him up to date messages, it took at best hours and at the worst days in order to know what was going on.

The amount of advancment in infantry tactics during WW1 is actually insane, before a company was a bunch of riflemen with officers, but now they got machine gunners, grenadiers, stromtroopers, everyone had grenades available, they were put into squads instead of an officer commanding 50 men at once, they had hand mortar guys (grenade launchers basically), snipers, flamethrower units, riflegrenade troopers and so much more stuff that is pretty much normal nowadays.",a9ecafe1a5258aa817bd0e74ceb9a86f2641e895,True,False,,,,,0,1653081679,,0,{},i9dm74j,False,t3_utrhl1,False,True,t1_i9d8ihx,/r/CombatFootage/comments/utrhl1/loud_german_infantry_combat_footage_near_the_end/i9dm74j/,1653081691,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653052879.0,

Then you don't understand modern warfare very well. It's a LOT harder to avoid various targets while fighting an effective war, especially when the enemy sometimes occupies those targets or near them. Russia could easily hit many civilians buildings just by putting less effort into avoiding it than eg. America might (or might not). Or than they might if they were dominating a war instead of doing fairly poorly.

&gt; So... because I didn't know about this specific building yesterday, I should be assuming that it was valid military target despite a history of the Russians targeting non-valid targets? Fuck off.

Is that what I said? Are you sure? Is it necessary for you to watch a video and immediately have full confidence in the events and the motivations of each and every entity involved in those events?

Also whole you keep hearing of Russian advances these are so small and without high value but at astronomical costs. 

For Ukraine the most crucial thing is time its why Azovstal was in essence a partial Ukrainian victory.

Ukraine has opted for a very decent tactic before they can start heavy troop rotation and advancements. Russian gains are basically them moving into killzones of abandoned villages.

Look at how heavily has Russian artillery been negated. US extended both range and precision of Ukraine with modern artilery and counter battery radars and now we see foreign mobile artilerry systems operating.

This heavily pains the russians because their artillery cannot reach Ukrainian artilerry nor match their precision and the low precision hardly effects Ukrainian frontlines.

Only way Russians advance is by simple overpressure, Ukraine extorts a heavy toll from Russia and lets them move into next killzone.

For Ukraine time is everything Russia has already depleated it self and is now pulling a final hail marry in southern spearhead. 

Even if they take smallest JFO area they have no way of keeping it by the time its done. 0 chance even with mobilisation. No chance Ukraine will have massive NATO trained and equiped army with modern weapons and high morale and competent command structure with higher mobility and longer range.

Seitchblades are in Ukraine, Ghost is, more precision munition for TB2, heavy and mobile artilerry, high precision systems like BlueSpear and Brimstone and Starstreak, the field is litteres with anti air and armour. On top of that they are getting more armour from Europe. Slovenia will deliver 30 MB80, Czech 60+ T-72, 200+ T-72s from Poland, large heavy anti air which is currently dedicated to protecting assets in west, new helicopters, DJI 20,000 drones, maintenance parts for MIG/SU their ariforce intact and running sorties.

And now US just opened up 40 billion USD budget on top of EU and UK filling it up with weapons and air and military intelligence.

Than there is economic warfare, India now pressuring them to sell oil bellow their price, Chinese companies and banks bailing, Africa turning their backs, they are about to default in few day overall a shit situation.

Even if Russia takes the entire JFO there is 0% chance of them keeping it. Yeaterday there was news that US couls supply them with long range Harpoon anti ship missiles..

&gt; Victory or loss it determined when the conflict ends mate. 

That goes both ways. 

&gt;What you see now is territorial gain that can be expanded or can be lost. 

Yeah, that’s the nature of war.

&gt;The conflict is still ongoing.

I think everyone knows that. 

&gt; The terms you should use are success or failure to carry out operations and make gains in the enemy territory.

Well, no. It’s not clear what Russia’s aim in Ukraine is. They likely wanted to annex Ukraine and subjugate it economically and culturally and wanted to capture it intact. They clearly wanted to do so quickly and put in place a puppet government before the world could react. 

That’s failed. They have turned even pro Russia factions in Ukraine against them and the long conflict has brought the world together. The conflict is going slowly and is costing Russia huge amounts of lives, equipment and rubles. Not to mention has destroyed Russia’s international reputation. The world sees Putin as a deranged murderer and the Russian people as either brainwashed sycophants at best, or blood thirsty fascists at worst. 

The slow trajectory of Russian gains and their cost does not bode well for Russian interests. Popasnaya might not be straight up a Pyrrhic victory but it doesn’t look good for Russia either. It’s an incremental gain at great cost in time and material. 

&gt; Regarding the length of the conflict, just google how long “Afghanistan, Vietnam, Iraq, war against isis” wars lasted. 

Russian casualties have eclipsed each of those individual conflicts. Not to mention, Russia’s foray into Afghanistan ended the Soviet Union. The US dumped trillions into Afghanistan and Iraq. It was hugely costly. But America had more resources. Russia can’t sustain that kind of investment. Plus, in Afghanistan and Iraq the US rapidly seized the territory and then fought insurgency. The Russians seem even incapable of seizing significant territory. Moreover these conflicts happened far away requiring huge US logistical expenditures. This is literally on Russias border. 

&gt;Spoiler alert: they lasted years when a superpower country and its allies were involved and some wars were even lost.

They were lost in that they were unwinable which bodes even poorly for Russia. The US lost 55K troops over a decade in Vietnam. Russia has lost like 20-30K in 2.5 months. The US lost maybe 6-7000 soldiers over the decades of Iraq and Afghanistan. And the US captured Baghdad and Kabul swiftly and rapidly controlled the entire territorial areas of the respective countries. These conflicts are apples to oranges but everything about them suggests Russia has already lost. 

There is no path to victory. Not even if they level and seize Ukraine. If they do that they can’t afford to hold and govern the country. Their own country will be an economic pariah. What’s more likely is an entrenched quagmire that bleeds Russia dry with no or limited gains. 

Russia can’t project power more the 7km beyond the occupied territory and gets excited when they level a town and take some villages.",2185dade8312c0d84b0a557ddc53a3a1b8996672,True,False,,,,,0,1653078425,,0,{},i9df3bl,False,t3_uu4k3l,False,True,t1_i9dcasr,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uu4k3l/russian_advancements_after_capturing_popasnaya/i9df3bl/,1653078438,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653049625.0,

The trick that had to be discovered was *not* doing the initial shockingly gigantic artillery bombardments that characterized battles like Verdun. That tipped off the enemy to the offensive and they were able to marshall defenses in response because of your insane two week long artillery bombardment or whatever. They stopped doing that and started doing brief ""hurricane"" barrages where they'd execute a huge and brutal fifteen minute barrage before advancing with infantry (and eventually tanks) - this also prevented the ground from being utterly impossible to traverse (that's what happened at the Somme - the terrain became unusable to the British on the offensive, being a sloppy thick mush of mud and disease).",bdaaf7a06e10376a63a528a5cbe12de73019ebe5,True,False,,,,,0,1653078176,,0,{},i9deje2,False,t3_utrhl1,False,True,t1_i9cyfii,/r/CombatFootage/comments/utrhl1/loud_german_infantry_combat_footage_near_the_end/i9deje2/,1653078188,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653049376.0,

Yes, Germany was militarily defeated. *However,* that doesn't mean the primary driver of German loss of confidence wasn't the fact that people were starving and dying at home. That's what's happened in Russia - the Tsar was overthrown because of a combination of losing the war to Germany and mass privation and impoverishment. The Provisional Government held on for most of 1917 but then they too were overthrown for the same reason in favor of the Bolsheviks.

Anyway, just because I don’t know for sure doesn’t mean I can’t make an educated guess based on what I do know: the Russians fired a missile at a civilian cultural building. If this was a one-off occurrence, maybe I would give them the benefit of the doubt. But it isn’t - they’ve been coming civilian targets again and again and again and again, for months now. So my guess is going to be that this is yet another case of that, until there’s convincing evidence otherwise.

OP says he doesn’t seem to see the logic in the Russians running a terror bombing campaign, since it doesn’t truly hurt Ukrainian morale, just makes them mad. But I don’t accept that premise. Putting aside the psychological effects of prolonged living under danger from random bombing, autocratic regimes love causing arbitrary terror simply for its own sake.

I absolutely agree with what you said about their location/culture/time of birth and how it could have molded them into someone different, quite possibly someone far worse, and the fact that people need to start being held accountable for their actions.. 

But young people are a different breed altogether. They usually  (not all of them)  act without thinking about consequences, do many foolish things that we as adults know to be utterly absurd, can be extremely thoughtless and bullying, and just plain pains in the asses most times. I'm thinking of my 3 boys as I write this whom I love more than life itself. They were all of the above and I remember praying they would survive their teenage years without ending up in jail, dying from car accidents because of their ridiculous driving habits, and all the other horrors most parents dread when they have teenagers. But all three of them changed once they'd experienced the things love and life teaches us. Having their own children, learning the hard way from their mistakes, and just growing up. They are now wonderful humans who are so caring and would do anything for anyone.

 I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm looking at this through the eyes of a mother. I see my boys in many of the young soldiers and I hope and wish they get the chance to grow up and find the good in themselves. I can't seem to break the habit of being a mother first. I will always HOPE for the best that life can give to all children/youth in this shitty and hard world. Maybe war isn't the place for a mothers thinking, eh? 

Thank you again for replying and helping me understand why you think the way you do. Who knows? Maybe one day the world will be a better place because people like us took the time to talk to each other, to listen, and try to understand each other.

Germany was defeated militarily by the end of the first world war. The entry of the US into the war ensure the entente maintained manpower and materiel advantage and won the war of attrition. The entente, as you mentioned, also made much heavier uses of tanks which allowed them to break through German trenches, especially when France started deploying light tanks in massed formations.

The government had the good sense to surrender before their army collapse completely and Germany was invaded, unfortunately this lead some groups to promote the narrative that Germany was only lost because of a traitorous government and the anti-patriotic communists.

I don't think there is any evidence of that so far, and even if it were true from a battlefield perspective it is based on a very narrow definition of ""winning"". In Donbas, where the war is now focused, Russian progress has been slow but it looks to pretty uniformly still be progress. So, the thesis that time will turn the tide is based on the idea that the Ukrainians are deliberately holding back somehow (which I don't think there is any evidence for), that the Russians are suffering unsustainable losses (which, even if they are heavy (which we don't really know) don't show any indication of being ""unsustainable"") or that new weapons will turn the tide (which is possible, but that is just a prediction of the future, which also is not to this point evidence based).

Beyond that, what happens to Ukraine (the country, not the military) if the war drags on? A country that was 45 million people in 2014 is now more like 30 million (if you factor in demographic changes, loss of separatist regions and 6 million+ international refugees). There are another 6 million IDPs, many of whom have a likelihood of becoming international refugees. The economy is shredded, and it won't improve from a longer war. Housing and infrastructure are also shredded, and won't improve from a longer war. None of this may factor in whether a NATO proxy army can continue to fight, but in the real world time is definitely not on Ukraine's (the country) side.",9f414bbe70ff3785a06465a29549adb92811c8b5,True,False,,,,,0,1653071087,,0,{},i9cz2eg,False,t3_us0uqz,False,True,t1_i9cqes0,/r/CombatFootage/comments/us0uqz/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_51822/i9cz2eg/,1653071103,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653042287.0,

In fact, Germany was *shocked and horrified* that the USSR was eventually arming entire regiments with submachine guns! This basically meant that any individual Soviet soldier had a *dramatic* advantage in firepower over most German soldiers (yeah Germany did make the first widely issued assault rifle with the StG 44, but only about 400,000 of those were built along with about a million MP 38s and MP 40s of all variants, versus *6 million PPSh-41s,* and 2 million PPS).

Throughout May 2013, the rebels launched several attacks to capture the Airbase, with their biggest attack so far occuring on the 5th May, when it was reported they had overran several positions and the defection of several pilots.  
  
By the end of the months, the rebels were forced to retreat and the Airbase had been successfully resupplied by the air.   
  
The fighting came only a few months before Menagh Airbase would finally be captured in early August 2013.

2032,[],False,,PlayMp1,,,[],,,,text,t2_evmda,False,False,"To be fair the meat grinder nature of the WW1 western front was more due to artillery than machine guns. Machine guns did, of course, change a lot of things - you can't assault a position by *just* throwing infantry at them, you also need artillery support as an absolute prerequisite, and cavalry are also basically useless in combat now, only useful for scouting, because you can effortlessly mow down a cavalry charge by letting loose with a Maxim.

Artillery was responsible for the vast, vast majority of casualties. Big, heavy explosives kill a lot of people, and maim even more. They're also useful for delivering poison gas.

The meat grinder also came from the stalemate of the western front that was a result of interlocking factors: first, tactics and strategy to defeat an entrenched opponent *and* exploit the breakthrough created did not yet exist (to be clear, they knew how to break trenches - throw artillery at them - but not how to *exploit* that breakthrough once they created it, leading to the enemy casually calling up forces held further back to support the defenders once an attack was underway). 

Second, technology to help enable those tactics - mainly aircraft and tanks, but also trucks for logistics, remote communications like radio, so on - was not yet widespread or sufficiently developed, so even once some of the ideas that did exist to create and exploit breakthroughs were put into use (mainly by Germany), it wasn't enough on its own to totally shift the balance of war in the novel tactician's favor. The Entente had superior technology and materiel, the Central Powers had superior strategy, but you need *both* to put trench warfare in the dustbin of history, and no one truly had both by the end of the war. The only way out ended up being Britain starving enough Central European children that the populace of the respective Central Powers overthrew their governments.",c1393a6a2304685d69e6dfc1908064e334dbecae,True,False,,,,,0,1653065748,,0,{},i9cmhdm,False,t3_utrhl1,False,True,t1_i9c7fvg,/r/CombatFootage/comments/utrhl1/loud_german_infantry_combat_footage_near_the_end/i9cmhdm/,1653065759,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653036948.0,

2076,[],False,,MrAdam1,,,[],,,,text,t2_nqvdb,False,False,"I am not denying that getting cut off from supplies is devastating. I am not denying that their strength goes down the longer they remain encircled. 

What I am saying, is that Russia relocated their forces and did not/do not have a sufficient force ratio to assault Azovstal. Remember, in order for Ukraine to expend ammo, Russian forces need to think they can mount meaningfully significant assaults.

&gt;The situation for the remaining azovites is hopless your insufficient as a fighting force without a re supply chain

I think you are maybe confused as to what I am and what I am not saying. Please read my statements carefully and infer as little as possible.

You appear to think that I think Azovstal is defended by godlike superior Ukrainian demi-gods who 10 years from now will have 500 soldiers and will continue to resist against 154,242 Russians.

Now to what I AM saying, you need to read above and think about what I replied to and what I specifically replied with. I am simply saying that, even if the total amount of remaining Ukrainian soldiers is reduced significantly, the geography of their terrain still affords them a significant force ratio advantage.

Now if you haven't been following closely, that's okay I don't blame you, but I've been following this siege, something significant happened before. Putin in a speech, publicly acknowledged that if Russia continued to try to take Azovstal, it would result in too many casualties. So what they did was, they relocated and disengaged the vast majority of their BTGs away from Mariupol. 

They can do this, because, internaly they changed their TIMELINE for how quickly it would be acceptable to capture Azovstal. Whenever you need to take an urban area quickly because the strategic situation requires it, you need to assault immediately, which has the highest cost in terms of how many of your forces you need and how many casualties you will take. 

But if an urban area does not have an immediate strategic urgency(think the Northern pockets of Northern France, Belgium and the Netherlands in WW2 after the invasion of Normandy which remained in German control until the surrender, then in that case, you can simply post enough of your own forces to ensure that the defender cannot do their own breakout of the cordon. That force is going to be MUCH smaller than the force required to assault.

As such, most estimates put the amount of Russians in Mariupol at around 2-3k

This article says 2k and small amounts of Chechens [https://www.forbes.com/sites/joewalsh/2022/05/04/most-russian-troops-have-left-mariupol-us-believes/?sh=4ce8684c5268](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joewalsh/2022/05/04/most-russian-troops-have-left-mariupol-us-believes/?sh=4ce8684c5268)

Now remember, this article is from May 4, which is 16 days ago. How many soldiers an army needs in a battle depends on a lot more than just how many soldiers the enemy has, it depends on geography and the strategic intentions of both armies.

So you replied to someone and scoffed at the idea of 800 entrenched Ukrainians being able to continue to hold out, but 800 defenders in Azovstal who are presumably the fittest and least injured, against a still only 2000 strong Russian salient. Would definitley be sufficient to withstand further assaults. 

Now to be clear, once again, that doesn't mean that I don't think that unless they get broken out of encirclement that they won't eventually surrender, obviously, any force that is encircled just automatically has a timer that starts for their eventual defeat precluding breaking free.

I am just saying that, if there is indeed 800 fighters left, that that should be enough muscle to be able to withstand assaults. This situation is obviously developing though and they might decide tomorrow to surrender all of their forces, but if they do, know that that doesn't change anything that I just said.",4c769f69589d4a968f360d398241416b13deefb7,True,False,,,,,0,1653065328,,0,{},i9clf6f,False,t3_utdi39,False,True,t1_i9brsoy,/r/CombatFootage/comments/utdi39/compilation_of_russians_fighting_in_mariupol/i9clf6f/,1653065348,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653036528.0,

There's a video of an incoming anti-tank missile - that I can't currently find - but basically, no. Human senses just aren't tuned for seeing or interpreting things coming straight at you at 200 meters per second and responding in time.

The larger of the missiles the Stugna can fire have a 15cm diameter. For reference an iPhone 6S is also about 15cm tall. 

Two seconds before the missile hits, it is 400 meters away. Go and place something 15cm in size down somewhere, then walk 400 meters away and try to spot it. Unless it's a really bright light against a dark background it will be really hard to see.

One second before the missle hits, it's 200 meters away. At that range, you can begin to spot the missile, but it still takes your brain half a second to go from seeing it to deciding maybe it's time to run, which gives you under half a second to actually move. 

So even if someone is looking in the right direction and responds pretty much instantaneously about the only thing they can do is start to drop to the ground.

Maybe if they knew exactly where a launcher was and they were looking at it from far enough away, they might be able to respond in time.

btw the body of the rocket blocks the exhaust from whomever it is travelling towards. The view we get from the stugna operators position is looking directly at the exhaust, and so the missles are far more visible from this side.",fe4304d0b7cbb26a0dc5ae9b14d82bf9c281573b,True,False,,,,,0,1653065153,,0,{},i9ckz2e,False,t3_utt7f9,False,True,t1_i9bwzms,/r/CombatFootage/comments/utt7f9/2videocompilation_of_ukraines_80th_air_assault/i9ckz2e/,1653065165,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653036353.0,

Look at any war in history. Absolutely every war out there, the longer it went, the less the country (whose soil was fought on) resembled it's pre-war state.   
So when US and EU decided to pump a shit ton of weapons in and therefore extend the war, what did they think was gonna happen exactly?  
Those weapons don't teleport themselves to the front or have a big red sticker on them. Will cause the other side to get more paranoid and extend their targets. And this is still incredible small compared to the devastation of a total war where everything that is seen as getting in the way of winning the war is destroyed.

The way to end this is to sit down, negotiate and stop the war. Giving Ukraine enough weapons to ""defend"" themselves but not enough to do anything significant is doing nothing but supporting their slow destruction...brick by brick.

I try to be objective; the Ukrainians have put out their fair share of dubious videos (e.g. Stungnas hitting tanks but ending before you can see if the tank was actually destroyed), but the Russians seem barely able to put a video out there without editing in obviously-unrelated footage, and lots of them aren't even successful. The videos of a loitering-munition and MLRS attack on an M777 battery the other day was even shown on Russian state TV, despite any careful watching showing they likely failed to inflict any major damage. Not to mention the outright [staged TB-2 photo](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2022/04/28/the-russians-got-caught-faking-a-tb-2-drone-shoot-down/). 

Propaganda is to be expected, so you keep wondering ""_That's_ the best they could come up with?"". It doesn't speak well of Russia's fortunes when they're putting out stuff like this while Ukraine's putting out stuff like aerial and ground footage of that absolute slaughter of Russian vehicles in those pontoon-bridge fiascos. Nor are Russia's attempts to 'debunk' it very impressive, I saw Colonel Khodaryonok claiming it's fake because there were destroyed BMP-1s, which they claim Russia doesn't use anymore, contrary to all available evidence.

(I suspect he's not even lying. The BMP-1s were _supposed_ to be replaced and mothballed and nobody dared tell the brass that this didn't happen and/or they're sending obsolete vehicles from their reserves)",8915d13ed917e25b376bdd89ee153627647764d4,True,False,,,,,0,1653062979,,0,{},i9cfegp,False,t3_utf5c3,False,False,t1_i9aj1q1,/r/CombatFootage/comments/utf5c3/soldiers_of_the_dpr_use_a_captured_ukrainian/i9cfegp/,1653062991,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653034179.0,

So when the Americans rolled in and kicked out the Spanish elite, these ilustrados kept fighting a vicious guerrilla war for their independence. The Moros (Filipino Muslims), as you mentioned, were particularly difficult to control and were never fully pacified.

No, that is the parent comment. 

I believe those 200 casualties (from Russian sources, so questionable) was early on in March. There's also external training grounds for Ukrainians in Germany and Poland that Russia can't hit.

I can't seem to find the exact sources, but I read reports that the Ukrainian 92nd mechanized brigade was in the process of re-deploying from Kharkiv to the Donbass to reinforce Popsana area. Doesn't show on the map, but it hasn't been updated since the 16th.

But it’s much more than that.  Artillery is a very scarce, very high-value resource.  You only have so many artillery batteries, and so much ammunition, and prioritizing where you are going to place them and what you are going to fire at is a lot more work than it sounds.  If I put my artillery battery in a location where it provides good coverage of material concentrations (like this location), I may be putting them somewhere they then can’t provide direct support for infantry units somewhere else.  If I put them in a location that best provides direct support to infantry units, I may also be putting them where they are predisposed to detection or counter-battery fire.  Every round they fire is a round that other soldiers have to risk their lives to resupply, driving trucks of ammunition on unsecured roads.  Every one of those trucks is a truck that isn’t ferrying ATGMs to another hotspot in the other direction.  And non-guided artillery can only do so much, most of the rounds in this clip didn’t accomplish anything.  Is it worth firing another 12, 24, 28 rounds into this place in the hopes of taking out 2-3 more vehicles, or killing a couple more guys?  Almost certainly not, unless I know there are high value resources there.

Military tactics are a constant, fluid re-evaluation of priorities and trade-offs.  I have limited resources and I have to carefully distribute those resources based on perceived risks and opportunities, given only vague information.  I reserve concentrating really significant firepower or troop concentrations for only those situations that will alter the tactical situation in a really meaningful way.",8b9a50f10eb7a87640a58e9c21bb0d24848ac6e9,True,False,,,,,0,1653060576,,0,{},i9c9b49,False,t3_uttkpi,False,True,t1_i9btpm3,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uttkpi/artillery_of_the_ukrainian_air_assault_forces/i9c9b49/,1653060596,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653031776.0,

If you can get those missiles into a place where Russia does not expect them, you can literally blast the shit out of them.  Conversely, in the defense, particularly in fixed positions, artillery can make it much harder for a gunner to get off an accurate shot.  Tanks fire both much further and faster than most ATGM’s, and properly coordinated tank and artillery fire can make it very difficult for missile crews to get shots off. 

Why was this BMP alone?  My guess is that the crew thought they were safe.  These vehicles should be operating in pairs, at a minimum, and a second BMP would have immediately attacked the missile crew.  Instead?  They can walk up and take photos?  No artillery to drive them off?  No counter attack?  Russia continues to operate in ways that are baffling.  

Most Ukrainian kills are coming from roving small teams that pop up and then scoot.  Swarms of these guys are very difficult to defeat even if you are doing everything right, and Russia is mindbogglingly still not doing it right.  Whether these small teams preying on Russian mistakes is offensive or defensive is a semantic debate.  They work well in both cases, either punching holes in attacking formations that do not expect them short of a fixed objective or by punching holes in formations about to be attacked.",67eb90aecb0bd024300e2b3dc13b903be5d27038,True,False,,,,,0,1653057029,,0,{},i9c0foh,False,t3_utnoae,False,True,t1_i9auipc,/r/CombatFootage/comments/utnoae/ukrainian_soldier_reportedly_strikes_a_russian/i9c0foh/,1653057048,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653028229.0,

AT systems pack up small. Sending them 1,000 a day would be no issue. As long as we keep supplying them, Ukraine will *always* have many more AT systems in country than Russia has vehicles in their entire army, anywhere on earth. My last count was 20,000 systems had been delivered. That was 2 months ago. 

Arty. For just 155 NATO, they were sent ~200,000 rounds. I think they will be fine on arty for awhile.

Counterbattery fire.  In good conditions, a well-trained crew will be set up and ready to fire back in 90-120s.  Assuming a range of 25km, let's add another 90s travel time for the shells.  So return fire will be *arriving* in as little as 3 minutes.

The tiger on the other hand required disassembly of the turret among other things in order to get to the final drive, which had a habit of snapping under load. Field repair could take as long as 2 weeks. 

There’s a reason the front nose of the Sherman comes off haha. 

The other thing that made the Sherman successful was it was designed by the boys at Ford, so it was designed to be easy to drive right from the start. It took very little time to teach someone how to drive one and thus became very popular quickly. 

Lastly, even though the British came up with the firefly variant, many field commanders didn’t want the foreign untested gun and many generals didn’t want to have to restart logistics supply chains to support the new ammo types….

How can we really know? The rockets they fire are really ""dumb"", but they stabilized in flight and have a predictable area of impact as long as their solid-fuel propallant rocket engines  running. It's not the same thing as shooting fireworks. At a range of almost 4 kilometers, multiple launch of unguided S8 rockets can hit a square measuring 100x100 meters (very rough estimation).  Video with proof: https://old.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/tgl0s4/allegedly_newly_released_footage_of_a_russian/ (_SKIP until 1:07_ time mark). This is a not so bad for a salvo launch at the distance to call this technic ""pointless"". This is definitely was not fireing in a straight line, but in a pre-calculated trajectory in automatic or semi-automatic mode. You will never be able to get the same result (at a long distance, in this case 3.8 km) using just a bare eyes.
The big difference with the Syrian video is that the Russians now choosing a different angle of attack.   The reason why - over Ukraine, Russian attack helicopters fly lower than over the Syrian desert.  Also, as far as I can tell, a target was locked on by the helicopter's FCS"" in Syrian footage (this can be seen on the HUD). I have never seen that in a combat footages from Ukraine with unguided rockets. The round-shape marker on the HUD is always moving and never fix on the some position (never catch on the actual target) before salvo.  Does this mean that this ""smart"" technique does not work in this case? Not a fact. This may mean that the Russians did not find a specific target due to low visibility/observability. Most of these Ukraine-related combat footagess shows a salvos over forest area. so it's not surprising. Perhaps they are capable to shoot at fixed (locked on) targets using the same fire-control system even  when helicopter skimming the ground and pitching-up nose it these crazy angles. At least, the Syrian video proves that the trajectory of these rockets is amenable to preliminary calculation.
But these video reports could be not approved by military censorship. The censorship may not want to show the enemy the real capabilities of the equipment and actual effectivness of used tactics. Of course, this is complete speculation. But what I don't believe for sure is that they are just wasting ammution with zero effect.



Seen a dozen of these launches from different helicopters, but zero footage of targets getting hit or the aftermath.

Everybody knew war was inevitable. The Israeli military took their training extremely seriously, knowing they would be fighting for their existence. They had Western equipment from France, UK, and the US, but they also modernized them with their own modifications. They created some outstanding strategies for when the war eventually broke out and crushed all of those Arab armies. Their recon was so good that in 1967 they knew their enemies' terrain better than the Arabs did, and knew how to cross the Sinai desert with vehicles when the Arabs didn't, and knew where almost every defensive fortification in the Golan Heights was.

Most of the Arab armies were not trained for an actual war. They were mainly used to keep their own citizens in line. This is the main point I think. They kind of thought they would just show up and win. Once they got hit hard, morale was horrible. The Arab armies would mobilize and make a big show. I think Jordan was considered to have one of the better militaries of the group but in 1967 they put Egypt in control of their military, with disastrous consequences for Jordan. 

I'm not an expert, and that obviously isn't the full story. It seems like history at this point but after watching those documentaries, you can see what hasn't changed.

3259,[],False,,BlessedTacoDevourer,,,[],,,,text,t2_6bisqibu,False,False,"Though for a more complete picture its important to mention the doctrine and ideas behind the tanks.

The USSR maufactured tanks for mass mobilization in the event of a NATO invasion, The idea behind soviet tanks was that there really is no point in creating tanks that can go on for that long when a tank probably wouldnt even come near amount of time during a war, as it would be put out of action much much sooner.

So they designed their tanks to be easy to repair, to get them back in action quickly, and easy to produce, to replace destroyed tanks quickly. As long as the crew onside the tank survived, they could just get a new one.

They were also designed to be exported to other eastern bloc countries.

Which is why comparatively, there is an extreme amount of Soviet tanks out there, even the T-55 still sees service in some areas of the world. Whereas older tanks from other countries would be near inoperable today, the vast supply of soviet tanks, and the need for them out there, makes spareparts easier to come by, that along with the ease to repair lowers the price of them, and can make them quite attractive for some countries.

As a sidenote, one of the major reasons why soviet tanks were comparatively ""low tech"" when compared to its NATO counterpart, besides making them easier to produce, is it made them easier to pilot. As the USSR had a conscript army they wanted to avoid a situation where the tanks became too complicated for conscripts to learn to pilot effectively, as there was a fear that they would not be able to make full use of the more advanced features if they were to be implemented.",68952b86b920a2126125733d7558aa9945871d60,True,False,,,,,0,1653051220,,0,{},i9bn2im,False,t3_utimoe,False,True,t1_i9b0vw6,/r/CombatFootage/comments/utimoe/an_isis_tank_pulls_into_an_intersection_to_take_a/i9bn2im/,1653051233,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653022420.0,

Russia doesent have enough trucks to supply its full military, it heavily relies on the rail.
If you destroy the rail, and harass the trucks, then you can atrophy the russian forces at the front line.

Of course this is easy to say, harder to do. The Ukranian forces have undertaken this same strategy in the The defense of kiev, yet again though, going on the offensive is its own challenge.

It is certainly possible that ukraine will struggle to retake what its most, indeed Russia is clearly gambling on this. They will not negotiate until they feel they have got as much as they can. Whether they are yet again overestimating their forces remains to be seen.
While it's true the closer you draw to crimea the harder it gets, russia is not particularly great at fighting on two fronts. Realistically I think Ukraine needs to take kherson back before Russia switches to the defensive, because that will make it much harder.

NEW ANGLE OF VIDEO FOOTAGE of her assassination

This clip below from BBC journalist clearly shows she was with a group of at least 4 obviously marked journalists. One of whom was the first to be shot before Shireen was shot in the head (just under her helmet near her ear). He survived and clearly had stated shots were being fired from an IDF jeep up the road. 

Footage below was released today

https://twitter.com/tombateman/status/1527306058359656449?s=21&amp;amp;t=925RiE8_QjWjPQXgOr-aWQ

Remember, IDFs initial story was that ridiculous Palestinian blind fire 300m away and 2 or 3 lanes to the left behind multiple houses and walls killed her - quickly disproven by Israeli human right organisation B’Tselem. 

https://twitter.com/btselem/status/1524346246743396355?s=21&amp;amp;t=925RiE8_QjWjPQXgOr-aWQ

They also claimed she was killed in crossfire. I don’t see any crossfire here. Silence before her assassination

In fact, the 4 journalists are clearly walking, for many seconds, in that same close vicinity. You can’t even claim that they came out of nowhere and that a shock reaction caused a trigger finger

Is it really difficult to figure this out when they raided her family home the same day, then desecrated her funeral and beat pallbearers to the point they dropped her coffin as she had a gaping headshot wound - in front of international diplomats and journalists at a French hospital, then arrested one of the pallbearers they beat after he appeared on media to tell his story? 

No, let’s blame Palestinians - or even better, muddy the water and keep casting doubt, and say this and everything that happened with the raiding of her home and desecration of her funeral still isn’t enough to prove anything - with the intent of making people think this assassination is too complicated 

Over 40 Palestinian journalists have been killed since 2000

[https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/05/un-experts-condemn-journalist-killing-amid-rising-west-bank-violence](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/05/un-experts-condemn-journalist-killing-amid-rising-west-bank-violence)

This journalist is different because she was the biggest household name in journalism not only in Palestine but arguably across the Middle East and North Africa. International diplomats and journalists in the region knew her well. She was an American citizen too

This is a Palestinian woman we loved beyond even our own imagination. Assassinating her made us realise just how much we loved her because she broke political and religious boundaries - not least the influence she had on female journalism in the region. She was the best of us. I don’t think you realise how many Palestinian (even Middle Eastern and North African) homes have been affected

Why didn't the US field 'Heavy' tanks? 
Why was the Sherman designed the was it was?

Because of the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. Everything they needed to fight the war had to first get put on a ship and travel thousands of miles across water. 

So not only does the materiel have to be able to perform in so many different environments, but also be reliable in all those environments. 

You don't want to dedicate a ship carrying 20 Shermans for 10 of them to breakdown immediately after driving off the ship. 
And do you put 20 Shermans on a ship, or 15 fancy new potential heavy tanks?
If half your Shermans keep breaking down, that's another ship you need to dedicate to extra spare parts. Which is a ship you can't use for weapons, ammo or other important stuff. 

Germany could just send their broken tanks back to German to repair, so could Russia and to an extent, Britain. 
America couldn't do that very easily without committing that vehicle to be away from doing useful stuff for 3times longer than everyone else. 

Reliability and mobility are more important than how big your gun is, or how thick your armour is when you consider an overall doctrine or army front. Especially when you're supposed to be on an offensive.

Some of there IFVs are infamous for having dreadful armour . I imagine the Russians assumed they'd rather take their chances on foot whilst the Ukrainians focused rightly on the IFV.

Several things to consider here.

1 - those Russian troops are now on foot. That dramatically reduces their range and speed which will make them easier to find and engage. This also messes up Russian plans. Those troops may have been on their way to reinforce another area or carry out a specific mission. They can no longer do that task.

2 - they no longer have what armour that IFV provided. Even jumping out and standing behind it is usually better than nothing. They also no longer have it mobile weapons platform i.e. the big fuckig gun on top.

3 - trying capture it without knowing if there are troops inside is very dangerous. See point above re: big gun.

4 - as the other comment notes, logistically bringing another IFV to the front to replace it is costly and time consuming. 

This is exactly what NLAWs are for - forcing russian troops to abandon equipment and engagement.

As for what you said of mediocre leaders ""falling upwards"" and other being forced into leadership positions, it sucks but it's not exclusive to the military, fuck ups get sent up because their immediate leadership doesn't want to deal with them and makes them someone else's problem, but that fuckup's deficiencies become compounded when they're wearing leaves or rockers and now have real authority because no one had the stomach or patience to fix them or tell them to GTFO. But yeah, in the military that's especially dangerous because unlike in the corporate world of civil service, a bad manager has the authority to send you into your death.

And as for social media I agree there's a time and place, active operations isn't it. I just have issues with people taking clips filmed by students in a relaxed training environment during an event meant to be lighthearted and fun and using it as a catalyst for culture wars.

It also bought them a lot of support from naive intellectuals in the west (which, sadly, continues to this day - there are still tankies around, and some were born after the USSR fell).  This *was* really different from the Third Reich, whose official line was the conquest of the planet by Germans of ""pure"" blood.

And it is almost impossible to turn the proceeds into imported goods due to sanctions. So that a large economy with huge foreign trade incomes cannot convert them into the import of goods - this is perhaps the first time in the world after the Second World War. Russian imports collapsed. This, by the way, is the secret of the super-strong ruble. The country is full of dollars, but most of them cannot be spent. I rub well, the economy and citizens - no.  
&gt;  
&gt;Western sanctions are still weakly restricting Russian exports. Most likely, this is a temporary phenomenon, and somewhere in the fall, export earnings will also go down. But the average Russian will feel the collapse of imports earlier.  
&gt;  
&gt;With the volume of imports of foreign goods at the level of the 1990s, it is impossible to maintain even the current, already lowered standards of consumer consumption. You should not seriously count on ""import substitution"", it has always been a bluff. Hopes for an increase in imports from China are more real, but one should not exaggerate the ability of the Chinese to replace the lost commodity flows. And just their willingness to engage in this risky business. Therefore, another decline in living standards in the coming months is quite obvious.

The main electronics that they imported from the west, were thermal immaging, cameras etc... chips for systems they wanted to instal in the (presumably failed) T-14 and stuff in the (presumably failed) Su-57. 

As far as targetting systems etc. Go, they use GLONASS, it's inferior and their pilots have been known to utilize western navigation in Syria, but GLONASS, albeit less capable, is their replacement.. so they're not left without those capabilities.

I don't doubt they still use welding from the 60's, but then again, their welding techniques in the 60's were superior then... take Titanium for instance, they knew how to weld and process it well before we did.

I have no idea about their precission, but it's safe to assume it's inferior indeed, but 7 out of 10 missiles hitting is still 7 devastating hits...
Regardless of accuracy though, missile strikes have always hit civilians as well, you may hit precisely the intended target, but then there's the factor of bad intel, or the civilians grouping together with soldiers or being close to makeshift military instalations.

U.S precission strikes have cause more unintended casualties than intended(I don't know the exact percentage right now, and am too lazy to look it up again, but I do know it was over 50%).. if anything, at least when your missiles aren't accurate you can say you didn't intend to hit something, when they have a high accuracy, there's no excuse when hitting civilians.",a0ff0eb10abba79eadf29c467dbc84463a9e0981,True,False,,,,,0,1653032130,,0,{},i9avhz2,False,t3_us8dsx,False,True,t1_i98u4xe,/r/CombatFootage/comments/us8dsx/attack_of_the_suicide_drone_on_position_of/i9avhz2/,1653032145,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653003330.0,

Zero deviations from the plan, speed going up and down to make sure its right... instead of just beeing at the target at one(!) specified time. Super rigid planing + execution.

I'm no expert either, but nowadays I hear a lot of information that's conflicting with what was revealed about these things before the war.

For their newer missiles they supposedly established their own production of electrical components, as they supposedly use sturdier less intricate components.

The main electronics that they imported from the west, were thermal immaging, cameras etc... chips for systems they wanted to instal in the (presumably failed) T-14 and stuff in the (presumably failed) Su-57. 

As far as targetting systems etc. Go, they use GLONASS, it's inferior and their pilots have been known to utilize western navigation in Syria, but GLONASS, albeit less capable, is their replacement.. so they're not left without those capabilities.

I don't doubt they still use welding from the 60's, but then again, their welding techniques in the 60's were superior then... take Titanium for instance, they knew how to weld and process it well before we did.

I have no idea about their precission, but it's safe to assume it's inferior indeed, but 7 out of 10 missiles hitting is still 7 devastating hits.",f2980fe3a05ca73ace42cb9114dd173e912c2297,True,False,,,,,0,1653030961,,0,{},i9au5la,False,t3_us8dsx,False,True,t1_i98u4xe,/r/CombatFootage/comments/us8dsx/attack_of_the_suicide_drone_on_position_of/i9au5la/,1653030973,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653002161.0,

China is continuing to do business with the junta after the coup, and tries to shield it at the UN. China obviously doesn’t like the idea of protestors calling for democracy and federalism, much less guerrillas fighting for it. **However**, to my knowledge, it also hasn’t directly condemned the ousted civilian government or the PDF, instead continuing to call for a “negotiated solution”. This suggests China is hedging its bets somewhat, as it doesn’t want a full-blown civil war on its border, nor does it want to burn bridges if the junta does fall. Additionally, Aung San Suu Kyi had pretty good relations with China, and it’s unlikely China approved her initial ouster (even if they now appear to have accepted it).

That said, China will definitely throw its full weight behind the junta if it believes any outside power, especially the West or India, is helping the PDF. This is a big reason why the West wouldn’t want to help the PDF right now (on top of normal concerns of foreign entanglement and conflict escalation).

You can read more here: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-11/russian-ruble-surpasses-brazilian-real-as-world-s-best-currency

From the article:
&gt; The ruble’s gains result from a series of measures taken by the government to defend the battered currency in the aftermath of Western sanctions. On top of imposing capital controls, Russia has forced exporters to sell foreign-exchange and is demanding its natural gas be paid for in rubles. Strategists say the rally isn’t credible as many currency-trading shops have stopped dealing in the ruble on the grounds that its value seen on monitors is not the price it can be traded at in the real world.

It's interesting as Turkey and Argentina tried to do the same in the past, but Russia was much more effective. From the same article:
&gt; Still, the irony of the ruble performing so well while at war is remarkable, especially as other countries that imposed capital controls in the recent past have not achieved the same results. Turkey and Argentina tried similar measures when they faced a horde of sellers in the past few years with disastrous consequences for the lira and the peso, which reached fresh all-time lows and never recovered.

Another article that describes a bit more about the actual measures:

From my understanding of finance and economy, and saw your comment to one of the replies about when will it fall, the bigger question is - can they make it sustainable. Emergency measures are meant for crisis situations and can do wonders in the short-term. But it's a ""quick fix"", what's important is the long-term. And I think that depends on a lot of variables.

4180,[],False,,ratkoivanovic,,,[],,,,text,t2_u3nqf,False,False,"&gt; I shouldn't have to justify that question to you, rather you should be explaining why the opposite is holding true lol. It's rather somewhat puzzling to me and most lay people why Ukraine hasn't declared war on Russia.

This is a discussion thread. Not simply a Q&amp;A. I don't have to answer anything, no more than you have to justify your reasoning to me. People have been posting strange questions with a narrative behind them, and I'm not accusing you of the same. So I'm not sure why you're being defensive here.

If you find it puzzling, it means you have a strong assumption that declaring war would benefit them. It's fine if you do, but I'd like to know what's behind this assumption. My country also has measures that are enacted in a war.

So it does make sense, but I haven't seen anything from Ukraine that says they have cons because they haven't declared war. Word on the ground is they have more people willing to fight than adequate weapons and training, and it's something they're getting support from outside as well. Foreign aid makes more sense to me than manufacturing (not that it will stay like this, of course)

On the other hand, we know that Russia has a political play here, calling it ""a special operation"". And they have more limited options available vs. it being a full-scale war (especially if Russia can say there's a threat to its existence). So I don't see any reason of escalating it in any way (don't know honestly if declaring war is escalation, as they are actually in a war, but it could be). On paper, Ukraine is less powerful than Russia and at the start of the war they were definitely in an unfavorable position. But Russia doesn't have the right amount of people to do a proper invasion and Ukraine is receiving a lot of western support.

Whether the declaration of war would trigger a stronger response from Russia or not (+ if they can actually implement a stronger response, nukes aside), I don't know - but I don't see any benefits from it at all from what I've seen so far. That's why I'm asking why is your assumption so strong - you must have either seen something or know something from the ground, that would make it a good choice. And why there should be a good reason why they're not doing it.",7d03d199c4986ff1ce2d00453cab5aa5dd98504d,True,False,,,,,0,1653029914,,0,{},i9aswuw,False,t3_us0uqz,False,True,t1_i99bt5l,/r/CombatFootage/comments/us0uqz/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_51822/i9aswuw/,1653029925,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653001114.0,

Myanmar/Burma is a very ethnically diverse country. The largest ethnic group in the country is the Bamar, who lend their name to the country (both names for the country are derived from ""Bamar"") and mostly inhabit the central Irrawady river valley, where the largest cities are. The peripheral areas are mostly inhabited by a variety of smaller ethnic minorities, including (and these are just a few!) the Chin, Rakhine, Karen, Shan, Kayah, Mon, and Rohingya.

[Ever since the country gained independence in 1948, there have been insurgencies of some shape or form ongoing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_conflict_in_Myanmar). Most of them have involved rebellions among the aforementioned smaller ethnic groups against the Bamar-dominated central government. Nonetheless, the country was led by a tentatively democratic-socialist government until 1962, when a military coup led by General Ne Win established a totalitarian communist state. 

Ne Win's regime was isolationist, xenophobic, extremely repressive, and irrational. His policies had devastating economic consequences, as the economy was nearly stagnant during his 26 year reign. After he tried to change the currency into one denominated by 9s (a number he thought was auspicious), wiping out people's savings, mass protests broke out in 1988. This led to Ne Win being deposed by a military junta. 

In 1990, elections were held, and protest leader Aung San Suu Kyi's party won the vast majority of seats. The military refused to recognize the results, imprisoned Aung San Suu Kyi, and ruled with impunity for another two decades. They cracked down on ethnic rebel groups, weakening but not fully destroying them. They also changed the country's name to Myanmar, officially as a nationalist gesture to make it sound less English (this move was unpopular with many).

In 2010, Aung San Suu Kyi was released following international pressure. Her party won the 2015 elections, and a power-sharing agreement was created that saw the elected government handled most civilian affairs, while the junta enjoyed complete impunity in military affairs. The 2010s saw economic growth, democratization, and peace negotiations with many ethnic rebel groups. However, a major exception to the latter trend was the Rohingya, who were subjected to a escalating repression by the junta. This culminated in an ethnic cleansing and genocide that saw most of the Rohingya flee to Bangladesh. Aung San Suu Kyi was heavily criticized for supporting the junta's policies towards the Rohingya.

Aung San Suu Kyi's party was re-elected with an increased majority in 2020. This alarmed the junta, who saw the political balance of power shifting. The junta launched another coup, arresting Aung San Suu Kyi (again) and dissolving parliament. This resulted in mass protests across the country, mostly through the non-violent Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM), while many ethnic rebel groups also broke off peace negotiations. The military brutally cracked down on the CDM, killing at least a thousand protesters. The killings radicalized the protestors, leading to the formation of the ""People's Defence Force"" (PDF) to wage guerilla war against the junta.

The PDF (who seem to be mostly Bamar) has since formed an alliance with several ethnic rebel groups, based around a proposal to establish a federal system once the junta is overthrown. The Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) is one of those ethnic rebel groups that has allied with the PDF (called ""anti-junta forces"" here).",fee5439430f59d05e1d9b3bacb0fa5bc2cbfaa7d,True,False,,,,,0,1653027551,,0,{},i9apxuz,False,t3_utkkna,False,True,t1_i9aizc6,/r/CombatFootage/comments/utkkna/footage_of_the_myanmar_army_outpost_near_the_thai/i9apxuz/,1653027565,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1652998751.0,

They are very good keeping people alive from artillery and the flat countryside makes any armor or personal easy targets. The problem is that these are mostly facing the old line of contact or front making the biggest vulnerability being outflanked and having supply lines cut off.

I just want to ask what you would consider a better source and how you would go about finding it? To me, all that information appears to come from press releases by the Russian government and the CEO of Baltic Industrial Company, which yes, would be available on Google, and you can make some pretty straightforward statements from it as a result. 

I'm not seeing the problem, unless you actually want to claim that the poster is fabricating the quotes. In which case I can't speak Russian so I can't source it for you.

&gt;The USSR was at odds with the West until it's collapse in the early 90's, they've been in situations where self sufficiency was paramount and they've navigated those waters before

The flaw here is falsely equating the USSR with modern Russia. The USSR comprised of many more countries than just Russia, thus having a larger economy and more resources and manufacturing to draw on; and while it had corruption problems, Russia is an outright kleptocracy that has dropped military spending to fund the oligarchy's super-yachts and mansions.

To illustrate the difference, the USSR's GDP was the second largest in the world throughout the cold war. Russia's GDP, *before* the sanctions started, was roughly the size of *Italy.*

So this isn't ""they can do it again"" because they aren't ""they"".

Here, have this. https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/05/17/explainer-is-russia-running-low-on-missiles-a77704

*In particular, the guidance systems for precision missiles require semiconductors and transistors that are neither manufactured in Russia nor available from China, according to expert James Lewis.* 

*“So unless the Russians have planned ahead and stockpiled munitions or Western microelectronics, or ramped up production pre-war, they’re going to run out of gas when it comes to precision guided munitions,” Lewis said.*

The ones that stick around would be destroyed relatively easily. The US Army and USMC has already started using the switchblade drones at the squad level. US artillery is leagues ahead of Russian artillery and US missile stockpiles dwarf the Russian’s, which is being depleted in Ukraine and their ability to replenish that arsenal is nonexistent thanks to sanctions on critical components needed to make those missiles. During the later part of WWII the Russian military was a powerhouse. The US even feared the Soviet Union following the conclusion of the war. But today, as we have seen in Ukraine, the Russian armed forces have not adapted to modern technology and its application on the battlefield. The US is always experimenting, adapting and training for the quickly changing environment in modern warfare. Strength in number and the willingness to easily give your life won’t cut it anymore.

If you are in a special unit. You train all the time for such a scenario. You never know when it comes and most of the people who do that are never confronted with a situation like that. I once got told by someone from such a unit that the scariest thing about this job is that for the average person, the chance is super small to actually run into a terrorist that has an assault rifle, explosives, other gear, and got prepared for his attack, but in his job he just knows that if there is someone like that on the loose, he and his comrades are going to face that crazy and geared up person. And in the end, you can train and prepare all you want. You can have the best gear available. But someone thats ready to kill, who got a rifle and explosives and hostages... Thats super dangerous. Nobody can predict the outcome.

So in short. On that day that unit faced that nightmare scenario. And the managed to end it without loosing someone of their unit. Thats already a super big win and thats how I see those high fives.

Its like if you know that in your life there might is going to be a test for you that can come at any random time or not at all. But if you fail you will get killed. And those guys, just passed the test.

Besides that, they still saved a ton of hostages. In a scenario where you have two gunmen in a soft target with lots of civilians around, 20 dead and 50 wounded is also not that much actually. Like, that kind of damage can be done in the first few minutes. Just look at that shooting in Buffalo recently. That guy killed 10 people in like 2-3 minutes.

And what’s so kind blowing is that Europe is full of rivers. The Russian army would clearly have to cross these. It was an issue in the 1940s. It surely was on military planners minds in the Cold War. So how are they so unprepared for something that they should have developed tactics for and drilled? 

It’s like SEAD. It’s dangerous, it’s tricky, but you have to do it. Yet the Russians seem to have not trained or planned any of it. Did they think the US just drove into desert storm or other conflicts and just said let’s see what happens with our fancy weapons?

That's not true actually, many many many investigations have proven that the US hit civilians with those weapons, there are some burns that are only caused by WP and many people had those wounds, funny enough it was multiple Western Media organizations that did the investigations, from the Guardian, to Italian media, who then prompted HRW and Amnesty both to do investigations which came to the conclusion that the US hit civilians.

There's been multiple investigations by media where the soldiers say they were directed to fire at a building where insurgents had been spotted, but they don't know if their rounds hit insurgents or civilians. 

The US came out and said we only did it as illumination and then the US army came out and said no we used it directly on positions where we suspected the enemy being in. But there have been investigations by multiple media sources that show that WP was used where civilians were.
