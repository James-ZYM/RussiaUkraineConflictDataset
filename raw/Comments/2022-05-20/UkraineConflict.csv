You're not wrong, but there's two important differentiating factors here.  Firstly, Ukraine doesn't have the huge stockpiles of that equipment that Russia has, and so they are not bound to the doctrine and all that that implies.  Second, Ukraine did have a couple very important bits of kit that the Russians did not, and in spades: modern and effective ATGMs (Western and their own STUGNA systems), and MANPADs.  Ukraine built an entirely new military doctrine around the use of these systems in an elastic defense that was specifically tailored to deal with Russia's advance...  and hot damn did it work well.

You're absolutely right about Russian C&amp;C problems, and that their entire military structure disincentivizes creative thinking in favor of rigid order following, and everything else you're saying.  I completely forgot to mention all of that, but I think we're both describing two halves of the same coin here.  I was trying to go into the historical cultural and economic factors that are going into their unwillingness/inability to change their tactics, whereas you're describing more proximate problems with their military leadership strategy that prevent straying from those poor decisions that got handed down.  We could also go into some of the Russian traditions of not telling the boss the bad news, which is also contributing to exactly the problems you pointed out of their leadership being removed from the realities of the situation on the ground...  meanwhile, fuck-all gets done on the ground without those Generals being there, meaning that they keep getting blown the fuck up as NATO SIGINT keeps pointing them out for Ukrainian artillery.

The problem that Im referring to is Command and Control structure and the officers corp or lack thereof with Russia. Russia does not have an NCO corp and has a top down structure of command and control where the lower officers cant do much at all without the say so of their commanders.

This is a HUGE problem in todays fast paced and technologically advanced battlefield where even at squad level, the Russians cant do a thing without going all the way up through the chain of command. This leaves them slow to react and vulnerable when Ukraine has officers that can make command decisions at every level and are autonomous to act under any strategy they want to accomplish their commanders goals.

We've even been hearing stories of Putin making battlefield strategy and moves and this guy couldnt more further removed from what is going on. Their old doctrine also got alot of the Generals killed as they saw their slow movements through C&amp;C and decided to go to the fronts to better counter any Ukraine counters leaving an even bigger breakdown when they get taken out allowing the Ukrainians to run amok and clean up the troops who have no one to tell them what to do.

Ukraine used to fight like the Russians until they started understanding how to move forward and created a doctrine and military structure like the West and like the US who was training and advising them. They built up their NCO corp and decided to up their training for them and now have an army that in less than a decade went from getting smashed by a small Russian force to being able to push back a force 10 times as great. It wasnt all because of the change obviously but it made a huge advantage in Ukraines favor.

[],False,,ApokalypseCow,,,[],,,,text,t2_3lvdk,False,False,"Part of Russia's unwillingness to change doctrine is that it might require a change in their equipment.  Hear me out here...  and fair warning, I'm no expert, this is just a collection of thoughts based around observations, some second-hand information, and a bit of reading.

The way a nation typically builds a military is that they identify the objectives they want that military to achieve, identify the capabilities they need to achieve those objectives, then they spend the next few years (or decades) designing, building, and purchasing equipment that has those capabilities and building doctrine around them, all the while continuing to cycle through this process to keep up to date with the battlefields they expect to face in the future.

After the fall of the USSR, the newly minted Russian Federation inherited all of their old equipment, doctrine, and officers.  They also inherited the USSR's attitude towards retaining great numbers of weapons, as during WWII they were legitimately afraid that they might run out of tanks and other military equipment in the face of the Nazi army.  So, we've got an army with a deeply ingrained fear of running out of weapons in the face of an invader, with large stockpiles of these older weapons.  They've refused to retire or scrap very much of this older equipment (keeping it in ""reserve"", ie. sitting around collecting rust with minimal-if-any maintenance), and so as to maintain their soldiers' training, they've also refused to advance too far from any of these older designs.  

Basically, the Russians have not only failed to follow a sane military procurement strategy, they're also decades behind on capabilities compared to West, all because of their refusal to stray too far from the capabilities of the machines they've been spending decades stockpiling.  Consequently, without changing their equipment, they can't change their doctrine very much, as they are limited by their capabilities.  Further, their lack of military oversight means that so much of their budget gets sucked up by graft that very little reaches the endpoint to maintain the equipment...  which leads to all the equipment failures we've seen in Ukraine.  

Russia is a dinosaur whose unwillingness to change, and fear of it, has lead to its military obsolescence and embarrassment on the world stage.",882ae3d725e4ca0bd6d271498274ba2418990db4,True,False,,,,,0,1653070739,,0,{},i9cybaa,False,t3_utswvr,False,True,t1_i9ckzx9,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/utswvr/a_russian_supply_convoy_was_destroyed_by_the/i9cybaa/,1653070756,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1653041939.0

&gt; Russian service members march during a parade on Victory Day, which marks the 77th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two, in Red Square in central Moscow, Russia May 9, 2022.

&gt; &amp;quot;Russia needs to stabilise manning in its military units in Ukraine and generate new units if it is to improve its position on the ground,&amp;quot; he said.

&gt; Separately, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Friday that Russia was forming 12 military units in its western military district in response to rising threats there, citing NATO membership bids by Finland and Sweden.

The Nigerian military completely surrounded the tiny territory and cut off all supplies, causing massive famine for the Biafran people. The French Red Cross enlisted volunteers to help provide medical aid.   
Max Recamier, Pascal Greletty-Bosviel, and Bernard Kouchner were three doctors who joined the effort. They were truly unprepared for the level of violence and suffering they witnessed during their work. The conflict even threatened them personally, as the hospitals in which they operated were often targets of the Nigerian military.  
The circumstances of the conflict also severely limited the level of impact they could make. Emergency medical care couldn’t stop the leading cause of  death: the mass famine and starvation of Biafrans caused by military blockades. Before long, the doctors were openly criticizing not only the Nigerian government, but also the Red Cross, as being complicit in the military’s human rights violations because it was doing doing nothing to advocate against it. They began to imagine what humanitarian aid would look like if it ignored political and religious boundaries in order to prioritize the welfare of everyone suffering, regardless of what “side” of any given issue they fell on. ...""

The Nigerian military completely surrounded the tiny territory and cut off all supplies, causing massive famine for the Biafran people.

The circumstances of the conflict also severely limited the level of impact they could make. Emergency medical care couldn’t stop the leading cause of death: the mass famine and starvation of Biafrans caused by military blockades. Before long, the doctors were openly criticizing not only the Nigerian government, but also the Red Cross, as being complicit in the military’s human rights violations because it was doing doing nothing to advocate against it. They began to imagine what humanitarian aid would look like if it ignored political and religious boundaries in order to prioritize the welfare of everyone suffering, regardless of what “side” of any given issue they fell on. ...'

I so love when your childish rants make your insecurity so blatant to anyone with some pint of emotional maturity:-). I couldn't care less for 'formatting' though, and certainly you have a megalomaniac assessment of the importance of your opinions - or how they should be held as unquestionable by even those who are not in the least interested in them. How ludicrous, sometimes your childish behavior becomes even cute, if they didn't harm the minds of those you brainwash with your overbearing discourse!

'No, that's not how that works. If you make a claim, it's up to you to back it up with evidence.'

I didn't 'make a claim', sharing a link for discussion, as I made it clear from the outset, is not even trying to impose the version defended by the author but the more I read the more I'm conviced those who question the Red Cross's neutrality have a solid point.  Insisting on your false accusation just shows your blatant logical fallacy. 

For those who read us:

""The typical straw man argument creates the illusion of having refuted or defeated an opponent's proposition through the covert replacement of it with a different proposition (i.e., ""stand up a straw man"") and the subsequent refutation of that false argument (""knock down a straw man"") instead of the opponent's proposition.\[2 ...""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw\_man

'Tu quoque (/tjuːˈkwoʊkwi, tuːˈkwoʊkweɪ/;\[1\] Latin Tū quoque, for ""you also"") is a discussion technique that intends to discredit the opponent's argument by attacking the opponent's own personal behavior and actions as being inconsistent with their argument, therefore accusing hypocrisy. This specious reasoning is a special type of ad hominem attack. ""Whataboutism"" is one particularly well known instance of this technique. ...'

I reiterate my point: it's important to show different perspectives and the one which bring up the serious question about the Red Cross (or some other assistance NGOs for that matter) alleged 'neutrality' seem very relevant to be discussed, not outright denied as your doing with such a ridiculous premise that the Red Cross is the only one to be listened to, when obviously also its critics must be given a voice, if the readers are to be given a chance to know both sides of the story, not your case obviously.

'Let's keep going with this, there is obviously much for you to learn that could be useful to you later in adult life!'

I'm fortunately on my early sixties, LOL I'm mature enough to have learned that worrying too much about what arrogant critics think of me is not worth the time, plus I have a life to live and my causes to defend, not your case either.

' ...Humanitarian agencies spring up by the week, often in the lucrative baggage train of the military-industrial complex. As a result, foreign intervention in today's ""wars among the peoples"" risks not just being seen as aiding one side but as actually doing so.

""According to the ICRC’s mandate, which is provided for by the Geneva Conventions, the organization is bound to complete impartiality while carrying out humanitarian support for civilians, wherever they may be. That’s a difficult task, as members of the organization must often operate ON BOTH SIDES of fluid and fast changing frontlines. ...""

...

""Purely apolitical humanitarian support, however, is RARELY achieved.  
In the organization’s nearly 160-year history, the principle of wartime neutrality has sometimes led it TO TURN A BLIND EYE to CRIMES that contravene its founding principles. 

During the horrors of the Second World War, officials from the ICRC visited the Theresienstadt and Drancy concentration camps, “model ghettos” designed to fool international delegates into believing the Holocaust was not taking place. Upon seeing the “beautified” concentration camps, ICRC delegates wrote a favorable report about the camps.  
  
As a result of the visits, ICRC officials attempted to “disprove” reports about the Holocaust and further inspections of camps were canceled, leading to the deaths of another 6,500 when other “model” camps were liquidated. The ICRC has “publicly expressed its regret” about this costly neutrality.

Now, the ICRC’s neutrality is under scrutiny again.  
  
Ukraine has accused ICRC officials of effectively siding with Russia in its decision to open a new office in Rostov-on-Don, a city where “filtration camps” have been established to welcome Ukrainians who are being forcibly deported to Russia.

Mykhailo Radutskyi, chairman of the public health committee in Ukraine’s parliament, appealed to the ICRC to not “legitimize” forced deportations by opening its office across the border from Ukraine.

&amp;#x200B;

Some, however, believe that the ICRC is falling back on its neutral status at the cost of Ukrainian lives.  
  
Tetiana Lomakina, an advisor on humanitarian corridors to the President of Ukraine, noted that she had not seen evidence that the ICRC was providing any help for Ukrainians who had been forcibly deported.

...

The discourse between Ukrainian officials and members of the ICRC has soured over the course of the war.  
  
In a video address on March 8, President Volodymyr Zelensky complained publicly that the ICRC has forbidden the use of its symbols from Ukrainian vehicles carrying out critical humanitarian missions in Ukraine, especially during the evacuation of students from universities.

&amp;#x200B;

By preventing Ukraine’s use of the easily recognizable red cross symbol, which are permitted to be used by humanitarian missions, Zelensky stated that the ICRC had endangered Ukrainians.

&amp;#x200B;

“The Red Cross prohibits this as if it is their property, and this is significant. That some people, very influential people, have decided to put a ‘cross’ on Ukrainians. But I shall not allow this, we shall not allow this,” he said.

...

Many Ukrainians have called for a boycott of the ICRC after it funded the project in Russia.

Upper case letters added for emphasis:

""However, she and other Ukrainians have taken the organization to task for its NOTABLE ABSENNCE FROM THE WORST-HIT AREAS, INCLUDING Mariupol, Kherson, Kharkiv, Izyum and Volnovakha.""  
  
'“Do convoys led by the ICRC vehicles go to these places?” she said. “Were there programs in Irpin and Bucha when they desperately needed it during the fighting there? You know the answers without me.”'

“We have never met the ICRC along the way,” said Ulyana Tokareva from the Council of Women of the Donetsk Oblast, who stepped in to support evacuations and food deliveries in Mariupol in lieu of the UN and the ICRC.  
  
ICRC staff fled Mariupol on March 15, citing a lack of supplies. Since then, the ICRC has been unable to organize regular humanitarian corridors to the city.""

'It is not clear how the ICRC intends to help citizens when Russia repeatedly breaks international law.'

'After the failed evacuations of early March, Mariupol residents reportedly stopped receiving information from the ICRC. Tokareva’s team was able to organize self-evacuations when the aid organizations disappeared.'

It can arguably be asked if deportations, i.e. kidnapping thousands of Ukrainian civilians is considered lawful by the ICRC?

'“We hardly see (ICRC support) in the humanitarian corridors of Ukraine. There is no ICRC whatsoever in Mariupol,” Lomakina said.'",f4473d57f79916fb268c6dec06e3d466711c1741,True,False,,,,,0,1653015699,,0,{},i9a7egr,True,t3_utjm7w,False,True,t3_utjm7w,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/utjm7w/red_cross_criticized_for_not_doing_more_in/i9a7egr/,1653015713,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1652986899.0
