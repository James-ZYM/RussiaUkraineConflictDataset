Russia has proven its conventional capability is severely lacking compared to the West.  It is struggling with even a proxy adversary: Ukraine supplied with the West’s select weapons and intel.

However, Russia’s nuclear capability gap to the West is probably much smaller or non-existent (at least we will consider as such until proven otherwise).  Therefore, NATO’s nuclear response to Russian use of nuclear weapons and subsequent escalation to a unclear conflict, would even the odds.  

If the conventional fight goes terribly for Russia, surely Russia will be tempted to change up the game: ditch the losing game and start a different game, if you will.

[],False,,jollyreaper2112,,,[],,,,text,t2_fhp86,False,True,"I need to look up more on the tank fighting. You're right, it's been ages since peers fought peers. The current truism that's being talked about right now is that for defense the PGM's are good for getting an advance bogged down and then the artillery does the bulk of the killing and the use of unmanned vehicles for spotting along with the software for basically calling uber-style coordinated strikes is a big game-changer. But tanks are still needed for moving direct fire to where it's needed in a hurry and the absolutely shitty performance of the Russians in the attack make tanks look worse than they should. 

I do have a lot of questions and I wonder if we might be seeing tanks going through the same evolution battleships did after WWII. You can't armor a vehicle sufficiently to absorb hits so you need to turn to active defense and guided munitions are going to outclass guns as main weapons. That's why modern frigates seem unarmored compared to WWII warships but are counting on intercepting inbound missiles before they hit. And no, they don't have much gun because their missiles are supposed to do the talking. 

&gt; wheeled light armor with light cannons can't replicate tanks for infantry AFV support

I was wondering about whether the new tank might just be lighter and more mobile. What did you see to show tanks fare better in this situation? I could be biased from only the good videos getting posted but tanks seem to be really taking it in the shorts from PGM's without much more survivability over IFV's.

Good point on counter-drones -- I suspect they're having outsized success in this war and by the next one there are going to be many more hard counters to them to put us back in the usual rock paper scissors of combined arms. 

If I were going to make a guess and probably be wildly wrong, I'm thinking that the future is going to be with a lot more indirect engagement. In the past, you want a tank shell on target, you needed to drive the tank within range and aim the gun by hand. You couldn't pink a tank with artillery with any degree of accuracy. But now we can do hand-off targeting where you only need to get the sensor in range to detect the target which is thus a smaller platform and then the shooting happens indirectly from a bigger platform behind, either missiles or arty. Unless someone can invent super-jamming to make this idea impossible. 

It makes me think back to the scifi idea of starship trooper armor and how that sort of thing would even now be technically obsolete. You would need that sort of thing if the only way to operate the weapon was by having a human at the controls and so you need the armor to protect the human and move him close enough to the target to aim the gun and fire it.

And yes, if you and your members continuously have pictures of a terrorist organization leader everywhere *and* be a member of its sister organization, it's terrorism. Definition of terrorism:

&gt; the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.

The 'intimidation' part is what labels them as terrorist. They are trying to intimidate people via carrying the banners of someone who have killed countless number of civilians via various methods including suicide attacks. That's why being affiliated with terrorist organizations is illegal in a lot of countries even in US which has a strong legal framework of freedom of speech.

**Key Takeaways**  
  
Russian forces may have made marginal gains to the north, west, and south of Popasna in order to continue their offensive on Severodonetsk from the south.  
Russian sources may be overstating the number of Ukrainian defenders who have been evacuated from Azovstal to either maximize the number of Russian prisoners of war who may be exchanged for Ukrainian soldiers or to avoid the embarrassment of admitting they have been locked into a months-long siege against only “hundreds” of Ukrainian soldiers.  
Russian troops reportedly regained certain positions taken by the Ukrainian counteroffensive north of Kharkiv City.  
Russian forces are likely preparing for a major Ukrainian counteroffensive and protracted conflict on the Southern Axis.

**Immediate items to watch**  
  
Russian forces will likely complete their withdrawal from the vicinity of Kharkiv City but attempt to hold a line west of Vovchansk to defend their GLOCs from Belgorod to Izyum.  It is unclear if they will succeed.  
The Russians will continue efforts to encircle Severodonetsk and Lysychansk at least from the south, possibly by focusing on cutting off the last highway connecting Severodonetsk-Lysychansk with the rest of Ukraine.  
Russian forces are likely preparing for Ukrainian counteroffensives and settling in for protracted operations in Southern Ukraine.",2f709847b775d014d33b0f02fcbca2b2fd8f5813,True,False,,,,,0,1653085938,,0,{},i9dv84o,False,t3_utth7l,False,True,t3_utth7l,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/utth7l/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_20_2022/i9dv84o/,1653085955,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653057138.0,

Lets start with the government, The ""Draghi"" government is a government of ""National Unity"" supported by nearly all the big parties of the Italian parliament, minus Fratelli d'italia (Brothers of Italy) a far-right party.  
It was born after the previews government lead by Giuseppe Conte (Conte 2°) fell due to the missing support of Matteo renzi leader of Italia viva (Alive Italy), a Liberal center party that had something around 4% of the parliamentary seats (the Conte 2° had a very slim majority).  
Now we will not enter in the details of why he did that (because no one has really understood), now given that we were in the middle of 2nd Covid wave the president of the republic nominated Draghi to form a government instead of getting early elections.  
Being a highly respected individual and not being affiliated with any party, Draghi was supposed to form a government more or less equal between the parts, and he mostly did, essentially not pushing for anything new but getting the ordinary business done.  
So far the governament has approved all sanctions against russia and it has given weapons to the Ukranians, although with some early reluctance. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Main parties that form the government are 4: Movement 5 Stelle (5 star movement, M5S), Partito democratico ( democratic party, PD), Lega (League) and Forza Italia(come on Italy(Roughly) , FI)  


The M5S (32,8% last election) was (or is) a populist party formed to combat the corruption of the main political class, after their victory in the 2018 they obtained the majority but to form a government they had to get alliances, first with the Le and after the first government fell, with PD, the sudden change of course (Plus other scandals), lead most of their support to vanquish down to 13% form the previews 32,8% of 2018, now the party is essentially split in two with one that follows the official government line which is support to Ukraine until victory is achieved (lead by Di Maio our foreign minister), and the other lead by Giuseppe Conte the leader of the movement which argues for a compromise and a stop to the armament delivers that Italy has been doing to Ukraine.  


The PD (19,1% last election) is a center left party, akin to the Democratic party of the USA, is probably the definition of political establishment in Italy, it has not that many ideas and its only capable of surviving because the other parties are worst, the leader (Enrico Letta) is charismatic as a Birch tree, in this whole crisis they have been more or less supportive of helping Ukraine, however their electorate is mostly pacifistic left leaning, not necessarily pro-Russia, but they argue that supporting Ukraine with weapons means continuing the war and the deaths.  


The League party (17,6% last election) is a right wing party, with ties with Russia always in support of eliminating the sanctions that we had imposed on the nation after 2014, with the leader of the Party Matteo salvini being [embarrassingly](https://twitter.com/reportrai3/status/1511067647407972365)(the shirt reads No sanctions to Russia) [Pro- putin](https://www.corriere.it/politica/cards/dalla-canottiera-maglietta-polizia-lega-politica-look/maglietta-putin-viaggio-salvini-mosca.shtml), so while they have been uncharacteristically quiet about this whole situation they too are pushing for ending weapon deliveries.  


The last party FI (14% last election) is a center-right party, it is by now a relic of its former self it used to dominate the Italian political scene, it is probably destined to all but vanquish in the next elections, they are supportive of helping Ukraine in any way.  


In conclusion by the description that i gave it seems a miracle that any form of weapons is getting to Ukraine from Rome, however we have to understand that while the public stance of weapon deliveries is one of repulsion, the parties understand the importance of keeping Ukraine fighting, therefore while everyone argues against them (To win some support at home) however when push come to shove all the delivers get approved.

I would agree with this. Most of Xijinpings predecessors were so focused on the economy, it isn’t surprising that people assume they will get more of the same. Clearly however, the focus has shifted and he really has his eye on the geopolitical sphere. It looks like he doesn’t even care that Hong Kong is going to have a contracting economy as long as he doesn’t get any riots. 

How much of this is his personal beliefs and how much of it is a consequence of the angles he pushed to come to power (pro-confucian, anti-western values, anti-corruption) I don’t know, but china’s focus has shifted under xi.

I’m not going to say that Hujintao and the like were perfect, or didn’t have ideological concerns, but I didn’t see the same kind of desire to punish people for ideological infractions that Xi and his administration seem to be pushing for.

That said, he can’t ignore it entirely, and even from a geopolitical perspective, not getting roundly cut off from the technical expertise of the west particularly in aerospace is probably more important to them than anything russia can actually provide.

It was immediately obvious that Ukraine did not want to be ""liberated"" and that Ukrainians were not okay with the Russians' aggression.  Not only would Russia need to get Ukraine to surrender, but they would need to occupy the entire country and stabilize it once the war had been surrendered.  That was never going to happen.  Even if Russia had been able to secure a quick victory, an occupation was always going to bankrupt Russia. 

After WWII the Soviet Union was able to take advantage of countries in dire straits due to top level native bureaucrats and politicians willing to play along with Moscow.  Without that kind of cooperative infrastructure there is no way they could hope to establish the security necessary to quash uprisings.  With Western military aid it's even less likely.

So a $0.30 electric motor that might meet paper specifications doesn't mean much if it isn't going to be available five years down the line and a product now has to be re-engineered to support a new motor fracturing the logistics train. 

More important than the weapon itself is the ability to target the enemy. For the US, and some of NATO, that is the AN/AAQ-33. This provides a stabilized gimbaled platform that can move independently of the aircraft that can locate targets, calculate coordinates to the target via laser range finder, altitude and azimuth, and interact with ground forces. The targeting information is communicated via MIL-STD-1553 to the weapon itself(sometimes I should say, there are other standards), and the weapon itself needs to have a UART for whatever communication protocol is used, along with providing the proper electrical and mechanical interfaces(typically MIL-STD-1760). Developing/sourcing a good targeting pod is far difficult and expensive than the weapon itself, much less all the standards around it.",1303e1425c2109f945657d265f5336d6367051bf,True,False,,,,,0,1653080858,,0,{},i9dkfp8,False,t3_uqwn4u,False,True,t1_i9d1vjy,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uqwn4u/general_questions_comments_pet_theories_and/i9dkfp8/,1653080876,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653052058.0,

The Russia ""spearheads"" have all failed minus the single axis making any progress from Popansa. 

It doesn't have 25-30 BTGs in it, that's what they have surrounding the entire salient. 

My point about the UA doing MULTIPLE spoiling attacks is that those are luxury operations done when they still have a reserve plus additional forces they could use proactively without actually committing them into the salient. 

If the Ukraine general staff didn't have a reserve available to react to an emergency deep in the salient would they have an entire mech brigade attacking towards east of Staryi Saltiv and another east towards Izyum? Or would they shift a few TDF infantry battalions to do an economy of force defense in those sectors since Russians are also doing economy of force there, and move the mech bdes to where they can be used for emergencies like counterattacking river crossing or unexpected breakouts (like Popansa)?

Because that's what generals do. Lower level command and staff plan attacks, higher level juggle units and supplies.

I did not miss that at all. The Fulda gap plans were in case of a Soviet attack on a NATO member. If NATO and Russia engage in open warfare all bets are off. It was logical, the US knew it had to defend NATO members in the event of a Soviet attack, because if not NATO would have imploded and a NATO implosion would have been a grave threat to US security. The Soviets knew that the US knew that, so an attack on a NATO member was off the table. Both parties knew that a hot war between two powers wielding nuclear arsenals of the size that the US and Russia still has, would probably lead to most people on this planet dying. That has been muturally understood and respected for the better part of a century.

Thats why the Soviets never got directly involved the Korean war, the Vietnam war, the intervention in the dominican republic, Grenada, the first gulf war, the Bosnian civil war or the Kosovo war. The US had the same common sense, some cuban exiles were sent to Cuba with CIA aid but no US forces directly engaged with Soviet troops in Cuba. Same goes for the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, no direct conflict between Soviet and US forces. No US troops where sent to Hungary during the revolution i 56' nor Czechoslovakia in 68'. We all had a relatively clear understanding of where an open war between NATO and the Soviet union would/could lead. We also agreed as societies that it is not an acceptable risk.

McArthur wanted to use nukes in Korea, but good sense won the day. The sentiment seemed to be that a US nuclear stike against a non-warsaw pact member would probably not trigger a shooting war between the Soviets and the US. 

The US still abstained. 

You are not only suggesting we declare war on a nuclear super power, we currently are at peace with. You suggest opening that war with a nuke. 

&gt;So my idea is that in response to the first use you wreck something that doesn't kill a lot of people at first but which is guaranteed to cause a humanitarian disaster without worldwide cooperation. You take the legs straight out from under Russia's giant hydrocarbon army and ruin their only source of income. You take away their ability to survive in their shitty environment. And then you make them trade back their nuclear toys for survival.

So your idea hinges on the assumption that if you start nuking Russia without killing too many, they will not retaliate but sit down and wait for a humanitarian disaster in their own country? How.. how does this make sense to you?

Let me ask you: if Russia declared war on the US and started using tactical nukes on the US economy(without killing too many..), do you think the US leadership would just sit down and just wait for the economy to collapse?",e2f6ec1034b82c2246018e12ac6646d1ae836c35,True,False,,,,,0,1653077735,,0,{},i9ddk9e,False,t3_utk7b2,False,True,t1_i9cwiur,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/utk7b2/potential_us_responses_to_the_russian_use_of/i9ddk9e/,1653077752,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653048935.0,

Unipec, the trading arm of Asia's top refiner Sinopec, is leading the purchases, along with Zhenhua Oil, a unit of China's defense conglomerate Norinco, according to shipping data, a shipbroker report seen by Reuters and five traders. Livna Shipping Ltd, a Hong Kong-registered firm, has also recently emerged as a major shipper of Russian oil into China, the traders said.

The low price of Russia's oil – spot differentials are about $29 less per barrel compared with before the invasion, according to traders - is a boon for China's refiners as they face shrinking margins in a slowing economy. The price is well below competing barrels from the Middle East, Africa, Europe and the United States.

China separately receives some 800,000 bpd of Russian oil via pipelines under government deals. That would bring May imports to nearly 2 million bpd, 15% of China's overall demand. For Russia, oil sales are helping to cushion the blow to its economy from sanctions.""

The UA are bothering to conduct a counterattack in Kharkiv (two brigades there, one of them is mechanized, thus valuable) plus another counterattack eastwards towards Izyum (one mech brigade there). Nobody does spoiling attacks with mech brigades when they have otherwise committed their operational reserves, its irresponsible to the point of amateur hour, as if everything is on the board then nothing is left to commit if an emergency happens. Spoiling attacks are luxuries, uncommitted reserves are a necessity. 

If that reserve exists, it'll likely be mechanized and its likely barreling towards a few key towns west of Popansa as we speak to retake them and push the Russians back to Popansa.

Do you even know what orbits they occupy? Having 60 satellites is a meaningless number without knowing their orbit, resolution, swath, sensors, revisit times, etc.

The orbits are open information you can find on wikipedia.

I didn't say I had no idea of the sats capabilities. I said you could put a bound on it based on the diffraction limit of the telescope size. Even if no photos of the telescope exist, we can put an upper bound on it's aperture size based on the launch platform.

All I said is we don't know what the sensor package is going to be like. However it's always going to be limited within the diffraction limit as a matter of fundamental physics. So I was talking more about whether it's just IR or multi-spectral, etc. That we don't know.

&gt; If you're just going by numbers alone, NATO as a whole has 384 satellites, govt and commercial. The US alone has 49 intelligence satellites, allies included they have enough to easily outnumber China's by numbers alone. They also have the ability to keep China/Russia from accessing commercial imagery. Even if its was just 60 Chinese intel satellites compared to 49 for the US alone, how is that ""considerably denser coverage""? Especially when you have no idea even a single detail about each satellite?

Oh, I can play this game too. If you let me just lump in commercial sats then the answer for China goes up by about 5x. There's currently a race between multiple companies in China for low latency imagery and real time video.

I said China has better coverage for specific reasons, not just throwing random numbers around like this. The US currently operates 4 optical intel sats in 2 orbital planes. Again, China has around 20, operating in a variety of orbital planes. It's a simple matter of fact they have denser coverage, allowing a higher revisit rate.

This is an area the US has possibly under invested in since the fall of the USSR. Over the decades NRO/CIA have asked for more grand systems with higher capabilities, but it wasn't seen as necessary. What China is doing certainly has the attention of the Pentagon though, and with access to SpaceX's launch costs and volume, will be able to fill any capability gap as fast as they can build the birds.",746d608f1eef641cb127a54e575224014cc3af12,True,False,,,,,0,1653075237,,0,{},i9d7y9m,False,t3_ut1tmt,False,True,t1_i9ccvv0,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ut1tmt/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_19_2022/i9d7y9m/,1653075252,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653046437.0,

Still, none equals China in persisting—and persuading its neighbors to acquiesce—in such an elevated conception of its world role for so long, and in the face of so many historical vicissitudes. From the emergence of China as a unified state in the third century B.C. until the collapse of the Qing Dynasty in 1912, China stood at the center of an East Asian international system of remarkable durability. The Chinese Emperor was conceived of (and recognized by most neighboring states) as the pinnacle of a universal political hierarchy, with all other states’ rulers theoretically serving as vassals. Chinese language, culture, and political institutions were the hallmarks of civilization, such that even regional rivals and foreign conquerors adopted them to varying degrees as a sign of their own legitimacy (often as a first step to being subsumed within China).

The traditional cosmology endured despite catastrophes and centuries- long periods of political decay. Even when China was weak or divided, its centrality remained the touchstone of regional legitimacy; aspirants, both Chinese and foreign, vied to unify or conquer it, then ruled from the Chinese capital without challenging the basic premise that it was the center of the universe. While other countries were named after ethnic groups or geographical landmarks, China called itself zhongguo—the “Middle Kingdom” or the “Central Country.” Any attempt to understand China’s twentieth-century diplomacy or its twenty-first-century world role must begin—even at the cost of some potential oversimplification—with a basic appreciation of the traditional context.""",d22153547377ac428f4be8c587826c763baf7a75,True,False,,,,,0,1653074889,,0,{},i9d76mk,False,t3_utth7l,False,True,t1_i9d645f,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/utth7l/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_20_2022/i9d76mk/,1653074904,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653046089.0,

Here are my thoughts, please let me know what you think:

China has historically always honoured its alliances. If you respect China and accept them as your superior, they will be on your side. That is the idea behind the  ""Middle Kingdom"" surrounded by vassals concept

Historically, or at least in the 20th century, China was on the side of ideologically and politically very different players like the Vietcong, the Khmer Rouge, Albania, Egypt, Myanmar, and North Korea, simply because they accepted China as their overlord.
China also to this day honours the relationships with Malacca (today's Malaysia) and Ayuthaya (today's Thailand) due to them accepting the Ming and Qing dynasties as their overlords, despite Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok leaning to the West these days politically, China is their biggest trade partner.


Today, Russia accepts China as its overlord and is therefore granted support, due to their tributary conduct. Vietnam, despite ideological similarity, has forsaken China's superiority and is being chastised for it by the Middle Kingdom, the Philippines on the other hand, a very Catholic right-wing government, have embraced China's hegemony and are being rewarded for it.

In the case of Russia's current war, we do not get it, it might seem against China's interest to grant their support because Ukraine is (or was) also a China-friendly nation, but it is a central MO of China's foreign policy doctrine to honour its vassals, without which its entire idea of soft power would crumble. Also, Ukraine's rapprochement of NATO certainly was interpreted as a distancing from the multipolar world China was envisioning and therefore from China itself, so it was easy for China to pick their fighter.

And they want us to know this:

The background politics is that the Marine Corps have a long standing bad relationship with the idea of possessing organic tanks, especially since fielding the M1A1 Abrams, with a large faction of general officers and past and present CMC who even been as obvious to state openly wanting to disband the tank units all the way since the late 90s. 

Logistics was always used as the biggest justification, and there is truth to it, but then operationally the USMC has relied on tanks to perform ground operations in nearly every campaign in nearly every conflict its fought since WW2. 

The latest justification to get rid of their tanks stemmed from the Army saying they'd only support M1A2, which meant the Marines would need to upgrade to an even heavier variant than the current. And that played perfectly with the China A2AD mission force redesign, because they needed to rob Peter to pay Paul, they couldn't create the new tech and missile units without scrapping old ones. By getting rid of tank battalions they also were able to slim down their combat service support in terms of logistics and maintenance, while getting rid of all bridging companies they say they dont need anymore (I guess LAV don't need bridges). 

All the talk about maybe getting a light tank in the future is a red herring, there were options already and existing US Army programs they could have looked into but they didn't even bother testing anything else when they made their decision. The fact is the ""Anti-tank"" faction made up mostly of infantry officers finally won what amounted to a decades long battle within the USMC.",7fea2d64914a098960da8a286b64429ad5c1f9d6,True,False,,,,,0,1653072751,,0,{},i9d2m6r,False,t3_utxx2u,False,True,t1_i9coluv,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/utxx2u/how_many_tanks_does_russia_have_left/i9d2m6r/,1653072763,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653043951.0,

China is also fascist, according to the modern political science based definitions of fascism laid out by academic Roger Griffin.

Historically, or at least in the 20th century, China was on the side of ideologically very different players like the Vietcong, the Khmer Rouge, Myanmar, and North Korea, simply because they accepted China as their overlord.
China also to this day honours the relationships with Malacca (today's Malaysia) and Ayuthaya (today's Thailand) due to them accepting the Ming dynasty as their overlords.

Today, Russia accepts China as its overlord and is therefore granted support. Vietnam, despite ideological similarity, has forsaken China's superiority and is being chastised for it by the Middle Kingdom, the Philippines on the other hand, a very Catholic right-wing government, have embraced China's hegemony and are being rewarded for it.

In the case of Russia, we do not get it, it might seem against China's interest to grant their support because Ukraine is also a China-friendly nation, but it is a central MO of China's foreign policy doctrine to honour its vassals, without which its entire idea of soft power would crumble. Also, Ukraine's rapprochement of NATO certainly was interpreted as a distancing from the multipolar world China was envisioning and therefore from China itself, so it was easy for China to pick their fighter.

The author talks a lot about next generation extreme range artillery, and then simply acts as if anything less than this maximal example is useless. There's obviously a continuum of cost vs capability.

Comparing the Navy's guns to a M777 is frankly, asinine. They're engineered to entirely different contexts and platforms. I think we can all be certain the words ""towable version"" never appeared on any document related to developing the Navy's guns.

He repeats the tired ""sensitive electronics"" trope. The allies figured out how to make glass vacuum tubes survive cannons 80 years ago. We know how to do shock and vibration hardening for modern electronics. It adds modest cost and complexity. This is a completely solved problem, even for hypothesized superguns a la Gerald Bull.

He simply asserts that guided shells for the next generation artillery will be expensive and problematic, based on absolutely nothing. Meanwhile, his hypothesized artillery missiles are always assumed to be cheap and reliable.

He uses phrasing that suggests Excalibur's targeting is no more precise than a whole grid square. Again, completely asinine. He also appears completely unaware that laser guided versions have been tested by the Navy for hitting moving targets.

And then finally, I think the M1156 guidance kits are a rather glaring counter example to his general argument. They're very precise for how affordable they are. I have a very hard time seeing this niche of utility vs cost disappearing even in the face of advances with loitering drones, or cheaper missiles.

About the only thing I agree with in here is the need to take TBI for artillery soldiers more seriously.

The failed Bilohorivka was a deliberate brigade river crossing operation done to cut the MSR supplying Ukraine units in the eastern portion of the Severodonetsk salient. The UA were extremely concentrated in that area, with their eyes on that river as it is the key to their main line of resistance. Any river crossing in such an environment, while absolutely necessary to perform for any operational success, is going to be fraught with high risk. Especially in the modern ago of increased ISR and PGM capabilities. 

On the flip side, the successful Ukrainian Kharkiv counterattack is only a spoiling attack. Its great they were able to liberate that region but we're taking about \~2x UA brigades attacking \~3 Russian BTGs, who were clearly on an economy of force mission, holding an absolutely massive frontage, who performed a successful fighting retreat until eventually the Russians had to release elements from their operational reserves to counterattack a bit and reestablish a buffer zone. Which was the exact goal of the Ukraine attack (forces committed to fighting in Kharkiv can't fight in Donbas or rebuild in Belgorod). 

However, according to those tweets you just posted, the UA are now over the bridge east of Staryi Saltiv and threatening Izyum by firing arty on it. Which is supposed to increase the importance of this river crossing. But wait a second, there are issues with that. 

1. I just did some measuring on a map, the straight line distance from that bridge to the exact location somebody plotted for the Russian location of the arty strike (north of Izyum is \~60 miles/96 km away. 
2. I just checked to make sure, but that's out of range of all Ukraine tube arty and most of its rocket arty that would be east of Staryi Saltiv. If they did use the limited MLRS specialized ammo needed for the extended ranges it still wouldn't prove the importance of the river crossing as they also could have hit it if they were still west of the river in Staryi Saltiv.  
3. Its very possible, almost probably, that it wasn't the UA forces east of Staryi Saltiv who performed that fire mission, as the impact area north of Izym is inside the tube arty range fan of every UA battery operating in the northwest shoulder area of the Severodonetsk salient. At any given time, 24/7, for the last couple months, they could have hit that exact same target on call, whenever it was ordered. 

You should remain focused on the real purpose of the Kharkiv counteroffensive. Is it disrupting the Russian area of operations enough to get them to commit reserves to reinforce it? Yep, its doing what it was a spoiling attack is supposed to do. Was that Russian reserve responding larger in size or more powerful as a combat resource than the UA units used to conduct the spoiling attack? Aka, was the juice worth the squeeze?

* If European countries think there is a chance of nuclear weapons being used, they actually would rather it not spiral into even a 'mini' nuclear war on their continent. Countries that border the region could be at risk of fallout and other adverse effects. Therefore if Russia where to use them, they would rather that was it - one and done - even if Ukraine would be keen to defend itself (understandably).
* The US and NATO as a whole are very committed to non-proliferation. That's why even among NATO nuclear weapons sharing is still under the remit of US weapons with US safeguards in place. It would be difficult to organise such a situation without Ukraine already being in NATO. Proliferation outside of these agreements just adds to the chances of complications and upsets the balance of power - something that established nuclear powers are always looking to avoid.
* While you can give Ukraine nuclear weapons, it's *really* hard to give them a 'credible deterrence. For that, to work you need robust, hardened/hidden ways to launch weapons against Russia *without* a 'first strike' from Russia risking removing this capability.

The ridiculous number of axes of advance they used invading Ukraine seems to point they were using the latter, they didn't mass at all, it seemed every single road that was heading into Ukraine from Crimea around to Chernobyl had at least a company to battalion on it, with the larger and more key roads having larger units in column.  

When it comes to the US Army, it typically doesn't plan on fighting on line with one another beyond the battalion level, its more dispersed because it has better comms and more responsive fires (we can actually pull off ""recon fire complex"" whereas the Russians can't). But its very dependent on the mission and terrain. 

For instance, urban clearing operations require units to advance in strict alignment holding each other flanks, such as [the second battle of Fallujah](https://fixbayonetsusmc.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/fallujah-10nov04.jpg?w=380&amp;h=323). But then you can compare that to the [battle of Baghdad in 2003](https://www.armyupress.army.mil/portals/7/military-review/img/English/SO-20/Fiore-Fig-2B.svg), and you can see how dispersed the US units are (and how few of them there were).  

But during Operation Desert Storm, we weren't dispersed at all. The [US Army VII Corps conducted the famous Left Hook](http://www.tim-thompson.com/desert-storm.jpg) with four divisions abreast, not counting an additional armored cavalry regiment screening the advance. VII Corps fought numerous battles with multiple battalions and brigades on line with one another such as the [battle of 73 Easting](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5497331ae4b0148a6141bd47/1455978436431-4BZHHB845UF9YCQUFKGD/image-asset.jpeg?format=500w), the [battle of Objective Norfolk](https://16thinfassn.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Map-DS-Norfolk.jpg), or the [battle of Medina Ridge](https://i.imgur.com/Z6dyV49.jpeg). Those battles were entirely mechanized in wide open spaces, with units driving cross country being guided by GPS, so they could afford to attack on such a wide frontage.   

 During the Yom Kippur War in 1973, which was used for some time as a case study in armored warfare, the Syrians massed five armored and mechanized infantry divisions on what amounted to a 10 mile frontage when attacking the IDF Purple Line in the [battle of the Golan Heights (page 4)](https://www.benning.army.mil/armor/earmor/content/issues/2019/Fall/4Kichen19.pdf). The famous ""Valley of Tear"" saw a single IDF tank battalion fighting from high ground in microterrain basically destroy  an entire mechanized infantry division by [fighting from hull down ramps against a frontal assault](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9f/0f/28/9f0f28cf08649940d5f4fc206a8f7b03.jpg).

Just want to add to this - my fears around escalation are in part where this distinction is blurred from the Russian side. They have unilaterally integrated Crimea into Russia and as such the assumption would be that territory is under the protection of *all* of Russia's armed forces - including nuclear weapons where appropriate.

The regions of Eastern Ukraine Russia is currently occupying we can expect to be treated in a similar fashion. This blurring distinction is where I think issues may arise.

I'd also refer to past precedent where we know the US in particular has explored the use of nuclear weapons to break conventional stalemate. Korea was the closest time to it happening, but in Vietnam as well there was a really possibility. My point being that if the US was willing to consider crossing that threshold in conflicts very far from home, Russia may be more inclined to go down that path with what it considers a vital national interest.

I do broadly agree we're not at the nuclear threshold yet, and I'd expect further escalation to happen first. Eg, I'd be surprised if the Kremlin didn't go for full mobilisation as a step before seriously contemplating using nuclear weapons.

Fully agree with your interpretation of the Wests response. Moscow has been surprised by the commitment towards Ukraine and that complicates any further decision to escalate. I do still think Putin assumes there is a nuclear line he can cross that won't result in a 'kinetic' western response, but (for example) I'd imagine a full embargo on all Russian goods and export/import would be the first step. Even Germany would cut the pipelines if nuclear weapons were used on European soil.",3d4768480c9b1eddb1355b5ce7fe33a9bff706c6,True,False,,,,,0,1653065226,,0,{},i9cl5t3,False,t3_utk7b2,False,True,t1_i9c2oiz,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/utk7b2/potential_us_responses_to_the_russian_use_of/i9cl5t3/,1653065238,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653036426.0,

If the use of nuclear weapons is not met with a decapitating strike, then other countries will begin to use them with the expectation that their regime will be a pariah but ultimately survive, and that is enough for most dictators.

* The world does nothing militarily in direct response, but the final large economies (India and even China) formally turn against Russia.

* Covert action is taken for regime change in Russia. I believe this is not a significant factor right now, as any such action would be obvious to everyone and may incur some other extreme response and the war is not yet a significant enough threat to the world status quo to warrant that.

*Russian attempts to restock its military may be doomed to failure
New revelations about Russia's reliance on foreign components means replacing equipment lost in Ukraine may prove nearly impossible.*

https://breakingdefense.com/2022/05/russian-attempts-to-restock-its-military-may-be-doomed-to-failure/

&gt; * ...a clear theme has emerged: the technology Russia brought to the fight was largely outdated or poorly maintained. With thousands of vehicles, helicopters and jets now having been destroyed by Ukrainian forces, one of the greatest questions facing Moscow’s military planners are how to produce or procure new equipment, at a time when sanctions are limiting their ability to procure key parts.

&gt; * Details show a dim and severely diminished future for Russia’s defense industrial sector.

&gt; * ...the weapon systems being used in this war are heavily dependent on inputs from foreign suppliers — the majority of whom are legally barred from doing business with Russia under the current sanctions regime.

&gt; *  The US and Ukrainian governments, as well as outside experts, all assess that these steps were taken due to the Russian military now running low on modern, precision-guided systems that it can expend on a regular basis.

&gt; * “The Kalibr missiles designed by Novator have around 70 percent foreign content in the seeker and other associated elements of the guidance system,” said the director of one Ukraine’s largest missile system design centers. “They have now fired off almost all of the units that they could afford to expend on targets in Ukraine. So, not all the import substitution in the world will permit the Russians to re-start this production line with their own home-grown components anytime soon — most likely never.”

&gt; * However, there remain nations even within the EU willing to skirt export control restrictions in order to make sales to Russian industry. Classified documents obtained by the investigative reporting site Disclose and published in mid-March reveal that between 2015 and 2020 France had been secretly arming Russia. At the same time French president Emmanuel Macron had been at the forefront to finding a diplomatic solution to prevent an invasion of Ukraine by Russia, France had already issued 76 export licenses for sale to Russia of military equipment worth a total of €152 million ($158 million).",0f618847c80f70b1c031af83efe28512b4ce51dd,True,False,,,,,0,1653061859,,0,{},i9cck1x,False,t3_utxx2u,False,True,t3_utxx2u,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/utxx2u/how_many_tanks_does_russia_have_left/i9cck1x/,1653061874,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653033059.0,

We'll either hear of a large scale UA counterattack to reclaim Pokrovs'ke and Pylypchatyne, which is the smartest move. Hit the Russians as fast as possible, before the lead elements can dig in and resupply. 

We could hear reports of UA retreating out of the salient. Retrograde operations are one of those that are extremely difficult to perform, super high risk, especially while in contact with the enemy. With all the Russian ISR in the area I doubt the UA could keep it secret either, too many vehicles moving on roads that are going to be overwatched. If they could perform it without panicking, even if the Russians try to interdict or harass it with artillery fire, the UA can still get a lot of their forces out. If they panic though it can turn into a bloody rout, defenses can collapse and the Russians could breakthrough pretty much everywhere in the salient and shoot them up pretty badly, at which point it'll be the highway of death.

If we hear nothing of UA response it could still mean they're retreating but managed to keep it secret. It could also mean they are refusing to retreat and will risk being cut off, stay the course. That  might be because they're stubborn, but it might mean they don't have any local reserves to commit for a counterattack, they're worried ordering a retreat starts a panic, and they think if they just remain in place and hold long enough eventually reserves can show up to reinforce them, so they don't lose the battle. This is a very tough call, damned if you do, damned if you don't. These are the types of decisions that take longer to make too because they have strategic outcomes, so distant senior military HQs and even nation state leadership might want to think about it before making a decision. If they planned ahead they already contemplated this course of action and know what to do, it's just a matter of giving brevity codes to execute certain preestsblished plans. 

As bad as the Russian military has looked during the war so far, what's happening now is their bread and butter. They are renown for preferring operational finesse over the tactical level, they can be sloppy in the latter and still make advances, but if they know what they're doing operationally they might have a solid plan for a breakout, with alert units staged in the rear just waiting for the word to move forward, pass through the lead units that make the breakthrough and start the next attack as part of a breakout. Done right this can happen before the defender has a chance to fall back, reconsolidate, and establish new defensive positions. The only thing stopping the breakout and exploitation would then be local UA reserves, either establishing a new defensive line capable of stopping next attack, or themselves counterattacking. 

But after a month plus of heavy fighting, who knows what the UA have in the area is. And same goes for the Russians.

One simple one is to proliferate nukes to allies, calculating that a nuclear armed Ukraine would deter future nuclear attacks.

Another one is a counterforce strike. This means the US would attempt to destroy all of Russia's nuclear forces before they could launch, and shoot down or disable any that do manage to launch. The US has the capabilities to sink all Russian SSBN subs in a short amount of time, which takes out one leg of the triad. Russian bomber aircraft can also be destroyed in a short time, by either conventional or nuclear weapons.

Destroying Russia's missile silos in Siberia and their TEL trucks is the riskiest and most uncertain. US Trident D5s are pretty much guaranteed to hit near silos and destroy them with a 100 meter CEP. The only question is whether the Tridents can destroy them before they launch after detecting the incoming missiles. The US is also likely to have kinetic energy perpetrators to poke holes in silos, these are essentially just oversized SABOT darts that get de-orbited over their target and discard their low observable stealth clamshell as they re-enter the atmosphere, which is within roughly 20 seconds of impact.

That depends: on paper, Russia looks to have a massive amount of tanks left in reserve. 2,800 tanks ready for mobilization with an additional 10,000 in reserve. But upon closer inspection, it appears Russias “vast” tank strength is severely overestimated for several factors.

First, many of these tanks are obsolete. That 10,000 number includes least 2,800 T-55s, 2,500 T-62s, and 2,000 T-64s - all of which have no place in a peer-to-peer combat against modern anti-tank weaponry. 

Second, the condition of the reserve tanks. According to Ukrainian intelligence, a Russian tank division found only 1 in 10 reserve tanks was fit for service. Why? Lack of maintenance (why pour hours &amp; rubles into O&amp;M on museum pieces) poor storage conditions (Siberian winters are rough on equipment), &amp; cannibalization of spare parts (need to keep at least some tanks running). 

Third, the political kleptocracy that is Russia. Military contracts are prime targets for grifting in any country, but Russia takes it to another level. How much military equipment has “disappeared” to the black market? In March it was reported that some reactivated tanks were stripped of optics &amp; valuable metals, either to equipment cannibalism or straight theft.

Russia had 2,800 tanks in active service pre-war, and has lost somewhere around 1,200 (slightly less than half).

&gt;We are entering the third phase of the war. Part one, lightning war, phase two Donbas boogaloo. Third phase I’ll call the Artillery war- It’s like phase two, but the Russians no longer have enough BTGs with the high level of cohesion to prosecute offensive action.

I'm not sure I agree with this. There has not been a significant decrease in the pace of fighting or progress to signify a transition to a new phase. UA has just finished mopping up the rest of the Kharkiv offensive, and Russians have recently broken through and taken Popasna and are starting to exploit that. Lyman, Veliky Khamishevakha are likely to fall soon. Russians are also close to cutting off the Luhanks oblast by getting to the Lisichansk-Bahmut roadway. IMO we're still squarely in the Donbas boogaloo phase, if anything this is more eventful now than lately.

I also think the focus on BTGs is a bit misguided: it may seem that the fresh Russian units, both newly arriving and refit from elsewhere don't fit well into the original BTG structure.

&gt;Oddly enough, we are also entering the fog of war. Ironic to say, the sheer quantity of related videos, maps and tweets have ballooned, but the info content of them have dropped.

TBH I have no idea why you're saying that. In term of raw content coming out of the fighting we're definitely _down_ even from earlier, to say nothing about the start of the war. There's a tons of factors driving that: fewer civilians close to the more static fighting lines, Azov batallion can no longer put out videos from Mariupol, UA started enforcing _much stricter_ opsec on big UA telegram channels, etc etc. You also have to keep in mind that traditional media, reddit, twitter, and basically anything that is not in Russian or Ukrainian is going to be noisy and outdated.

Things began to become untenable in the Kremlin when first localized, then major counterattack began to shove the Pact troops back towards East Germany.

Afraid of NATO reuniting Germany, liberating Poland, and even move into Mother Russia, the Soviets (without the knowledge of their allies) give warning to the heads of NATO countries that they were launching a single nuclear weapon at ""an average city"", with the threat of more if their demands are not met.

After Birmingham, England takes a single megaton-sized nuke, the Royal Navy and US Navy launch a retaliatory strike... four weapons in the 500Kt range each, to show solidarity within NATO.

This was an informative article even if I am not yet fully on board with the main assertion; that new cannon artillery should not be developed. I do agree that the *missilization* of warfare is happening as we speak and is making war more deadly all the time. However I do not think that it will happen so fast that modern artillery systems being developed now will be obsolete before they are deployed. I doubt the M1299 will have as many decades in service as the M109 has, but I do think it will be useful for at least a decade or two. 

One thing that got me thinking was the blast pressure having such a negative impact on the health of artillery soldiers. There is a chart in the article that shows that brain injuries are disproportionately higher in cannon artillery soldiers. And the author makes the point that the increased pressure of the rounds being fired will increase these health problems. However I was under the impression that the longer barrel length or caliber of the new guns will decrease pressure at the muzzle in contrast to chamber pressure. And the longer length will make the muzzle physically further away from the soldiers firing it, thus reducing felt blast pressure again. I have included a link to an article that looks at some of these issues in the further reading section below. 

---------------------

&gt; * Lobbing shells puts a tremendous amount of force on a firing mechanism, which must significantly increase its weight in proportion to the force applied to a shell. The massive weight of big guns, which has historically re- stricted them to impractical em- ployment as railway guns, fixed fortifications or super-heavy tractor with debilitating mobility issues, proves an impassable mechanical limit to the scaling-up of cannon artillery. 

&gt; * Cannon artillery cannot fire more powerful shells, nor can it shoot them farther, if they are to remain a reasonable size and weight to maneuver in a near-peer conflict. So it’s curious that the Army’s new Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) is repeating the same hubris that led to the unwieldy Paris and Gustav guns of the past. 

&gt; * The ERCA’s 70km range is meant to outgun the 40km achieved by the Russian 2S33 Msta-SM2, though it’s perhaps al- ready outmatched by the purported 70-kilometer range of Russia’s new 2S35 Koalitsiya-SV. ERCA’s range, over double that of the Army’s cur- rent rocket-assisted projectiles, is achieved with an extended barrel, super-charged propellant and 1,000 additional pounds, compared to the existing M109A7 self-propelled howitzer. 

&gt; * While these may sound like worthy trade-offs for great- er range, they either exacerbate or do not address the real problems limiting the capabilities of cannon artillery, which are blast overpres- sure, limited rate of fire, stress on electronics and predictable ballistic trajectories. 

&gt; * Blast overpressure: the propellant charges used to fire artillery shells are traumatic to the human brain. Already, commanders are known to give Artillerymen 24-hour breaks after firing 10 charges of 5H, one of the most powerful in widespread use. To shoot a projectile over twice as far, ERCA will be exerting over twice the stress on cannon crew members. This may take Artillery- men out of the fight and prove a ticking time bomb for neurologi- cal disorders, similar to the latent effects of concussions in football players. 

&gt; * Without the accuracy provided by advanced electronics, the Field Artillery also has no shell capable of piercing enemy armor…

&gt; * Predictable ballistic trajectories: shells fired from a cannon follow predictable flight paths, which can be instantaneously tracked by coun- terbattery radar and lead to the de- struction of the firing unit. 

&gt; * These flaws, faced by all cannons, mean that cannon artillery is a dead-end to innovation. 

&gt; * The future of the Field Artillery be- longs to missiles, if for no other rea- son than they can be innovated past the mechanical constraints dis- cussed here. 

&gt; * Weight of firing mechanism: since missiles can be fired with little to no recoil, there’s no need for a heavy firing mechanism capable of handling significant recoil. This results in less wear on the firing platform’s components. 

&gt; * Blast overpressure: missiles accelerate quickly, but don’t even approach the instantaneous explosive force of an artillery charge. This leaves artillery crew members safe no matter the desired range of the projectile. 

&gt; * Limited rate of fire: in cannon ar- tillery, all rounds must exit through the same tube. This is inherently slow…

&gt; * Missiles have always been lacking in fire support roles, for reasons of either inaccuracy (dumb rockets are less accurate than dumb artillery) or cost (smart missiles are costlier than dumb artillery). 

&gt; * But because the Field Artillery is now expected to hit targets at 70km with the ex- pensive and problematic ERCA and a planned suite of expensive and problematic shells, these demands can clearly be better met by mis- siles. 

&gt; * The MLRS, much less the HIMARS, lacks the volume of missiles nec- essary for massed or sustained fire by one vehicle, and both are sub- ject to lengthy reload times. While both systems are capable of send- ing a volley of missiles blanket- ing a square kilometer, this is only achievable with cluster munitions, which are both against internation- al norms and highly dangerous to allied troops later moving through the affected area, due to significant dud rates. 

&gt; * If looking for a missile artillery system that could be adapt- ed for both the range and rate of fire of the autoloading ERCA 1C and the lower cost and mechanical stresses of our legacy cannon artillery, the Tornado-G is the best example. At only 14 tons, its truck-mounted missile rack contains 40 tubes, each with a missile capable of ranging 40km with a 55lb warhead; it can fire all 40 rounds in 20 seconds, and its reload time is seven min- utes. And though its 40km range is less than ERCA’s 70km, its warhead weight is almost four times heavier. If the Field Artillery were to produce a counterpart to the Tornado-G, our doctrinal need for accuracy would require smart missiles that may appear more expensive than dumb cannon artillery shells. However, the greater accuracy of smart mis- siles means fewer rounds will be expended to achieve the same effect as a dumb cannon shell. 

&gt; * Additionally, the Tornado G’s rate of fire over 20 seconds could only be matched by a battalion-plus of 20 M777A2 howitzers firing their smaller war- heads; in sustained fire, four Tor- nado-Gs could keep up with the same battalion of howitzers, despite having two crew members each to the howitzer’s 10. In other words, smart missiles would more than make up for their costs through ef- ficient massing of fire, while put- ting fewer Artillerymen at risk. 

&gt; * And again, this is all available with existing technol- ogy, not only more effective than scaled-up cannons but simpler and cheaper.

There has been zero indication Russia is concerned about collateral damage.

Additionally there has never BEEN a good response to the use of nuclear weapons. The question here is a moral one. Would we use nuclear weapons to prevent a third party from suffering a genocide, or sacrifice them to potentially save humanity? Keeping in mind that once you sacrifice one ethnicity, there is now an expectation that other ethnicities can be sacrificed as well.

Any conventional army we try to field in russia would be at risk of being destroyed by tactical nukes as well, making conventional engagement foolish.

And offering russia ""a level of success"" seems equally immoral considering it would be more or less offering them fractional genocide. Additionally there has been zero indication outside of nervous western magazines that Putin is interested in a partial victory.

So we come back to the original question. How much nuclear genocide are we willing to tolerate from afar to ensure our survival? How much do we trust that finland wouldn't be next, or sweden, or poland? (Once russia sees we are too afraid to move after a nuclear strike, they will do what they always do: the same thing again, grabbing as much as they can.)

I would offer that it is more moral to stand up at this point, regardless of the consequences, than to slowly slide into a global degeneracy where we are all kept at the whim of a dying madman. The only moral decision is to make it clear that ukraine is under the west's nuclear umbrella.",6f71038780a3c2b1738d6d5a30456ccd766c38af,True,False,,,,,0,1653053910,,0,{},i9bt0hh,False,t3_utk7b2,False,True,t1_i9atsuj,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/utk7b2/potential_us_responses_to_the_russian_use_of/i9bt0hh/,1653053926,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653025110.0,

I don't disagree.

At least where Iraq is concerned. Afghanistan was similar but not the same, while Kosovo was unique in modern times, and while I see the Russian grievance, they abrogated their obligation to deal with trouble in their own neighbourhood when it was required, so NATO did it for them.

NATO membership politics in Finland are pretty complicated, but I think that's a wrong read. In fact, I'd say it's the opposite: The amount of support US has provided Ukraine has raised the perception of the value of NATO membership. A lot of people have been against joining because they've thought nobody would actually help anyway. Baltic states have been begging for permanent troops from NATO without getting any. Previous President Trump openly questioned whether helping NATO allies makes sense.

But now people read about all the stuff US (and other countries) are delivering to Ukraine even without treaty obligations. It looks quite different than in the Winter War, where Sweden was the only one giving significant material support. Value of alliances looks higher now.

Third phase I’ll call the Artillery war- It’s like phase two, but the Russians no longer have enough BTGs with the high level of cohesion to prosecute offensive action. They’re still viable units, but you’d be surprised how few losses a BTG needs to loose the cutting edge needed for mobile warfare. I’ve seen pundits who say 10% is enough, I default closer to 20%, but The Who matters a lot- call it 10-30% casualties, depending on the tooth to tail and officer to soldier ratios.  They aren’t zombie units, you need about 50% casualties and a fair number of dead brass for that- But they might as well be, if asked to mauveur offensively.

Ukraine units on the front line aren’t in any better shape mind you. They can hold a trench or retreat in good order, but they won’t be marching on Belgorod any time soon. 

The one arm still in tip top shape, on both sides is the artillery. Neither side has suffered extensive losses in the batteries, and even if they did, it would be moot- 83 days into the war, the level of artillery fire is governed more by the supply of ammo than number of tubes. The Russians could lose 20% of their artillery tomorrow and it would have a negligible effect on their ordinance fired. So now is the time of “The Lords of War”.  

Expect the lines to stay fairly static, with small advances where either side has a couple cohesive units to feed into the grinder- Fresh units up from Crimea, the last tranche of recombined BTGs from Kyiv-Sumy. In the Luhansk, fresh Ukraine units hitting the Kharkiv front- But the sprinters all have blisters, it’s cross country runner times.

This is the daily grind, artillery and drones, small ambush teams, logistics war and the tyranny of numbers. Russia has reached peak vehicle- old reserve Soviet gear will be reconditioned but the rate of rehab is well below the replacement rate. Ukraine is in better shape in the mid term, as western equipment augments repair and refurb-the advantage of holding the field after the battles is that you get to pick up all the used stuff, and besides, so much of their war has been on the defensive that they haven’t attrited at the same rate (for comparison, on the Kherson front, Ukraine has had more manuever and attack and they are as out of armored vehicles in this sector as the Russians. The Artillery phase has been going on here for a couple weeks already.

This phase will transition into phase 4, the counter attack eventually. It’s possible the transition will be regional and not all at once, and could take anywhere from two days to to months to kick off. It’s dependent upon 1)degrading Russian logistics to the front enough to seriously impact combat capacity, 2) Attrition rate of Russian vehicles of all types, 3) Ukraine’s rehab rate of AF brigades and combat readiness of the reserve brigades.  I expect it to start in the north and the south, a grand envelopment effort that attempts to avoid the meat grinder in the Donbas and just cut it off. How successful will it be? I have hopes.

Oddly enough, we are also entering the fog of war. Ironic to say, the sheer quantity of related videos, maps and tweete have ballooned, but the info content of them have dropped. Several prominent and reliable bloggers like Orynx and Militaryland.net have burned out,karma miners have spammed the sites and anything hitting real networks/ papers is old news, telling us things we’ve known for 72 hours. I might tape over my wedding video with footage of the Russian river crossing attempt, but even I’m satiated by 30 threads about it a day over at Ukraine Conflict. And the more organized news gets involved, the more soft news we see and the less tactical info- The narrative one of the poor propel who’s life has been completely fucked by the Russians is valid narrative, but we need to be streets ahead, not streets behind on the tactical topics.

First and foremost I do not see a scenario where Russia uses a nuclear weapon and NATO does not respond. Ie. the 'Staying the course option' is invalid in my opinion. 

From there we gave three possible options:

-- All out nuclear response

-- Measured nuclear response

-- Non nuclear response

All out nuclear response essentially means glassing Russia in the hopes that they can not respond fast enough or they can not respond in full to do the same to us. This response may rely somewhat on the possibility that the Russian nuclear arsenal is poorly maintained and significant portion of it may not work and their interception capability may be low. 

Measured Nuclear Response essentially means some form of nuclear response short of total all out annihilation. This may range in form of a nuke on the Russian forces in Ukraine to a limited strike(s) inside Russia, short of total annihilation. This response would give Russia every chance to retaliate. 

Non Nuclear response means NATO strikes on Russian forces in Ukraine or possibly the all out invasion of Russia using conventional means. The aim would be to remove the Russian government from existence and preclude any further use of their nuclear arsenal by destroying it with conventional arms. This would be likely slow and costly and may not work at all. 

From these the likely outcomes are:

`Russian nuke -&gt; All out response -&gt; Fast escalation -&gt; (possibly limited) MAD`

`Russian nuke -&gt; Limited response -&gt; Slow escalation -&gt; MAD`

`Russian nuke -&gt; Conventional response -&gt; Further Russian nukes -&gt;  All out response -&gt; MAD`

The scenario I've become most concerned with as Russia continues to perform poorly in this way is one where Ukraine is essentially used as a nuclear hostage. Direct threats to use nuclear weapons both in the course of the fighting and even on cities themselves in order to negotiate a peace favourable to Russia.

USA/NATO cannot protect Ukraine from a nuclear attack without extending the nuclear umbrella to them. Russia is unlikely to consider such a move credible when it already occupies a significant part of Ukraine (ie - the same reasons Ukraine isn't able to join NATO in its current state). 

Extending that guarantee also threatens a strategic nuclear war between the guarantor and Russia. This is why Russia will not see it as a credible threat - which Western nation is willing to start a thermonuclear war over Ukraine?

This means that in the nuclear realm of this conflict, the cards are stacked in Russia's favour. It also means the primary means of averting this comes down to Russia's future aspirations in the world. Putin will need to consider the following:

* Russia will become a pariah state if nuclear weapons are used against a non-nuclear state. Russia is better able to manage that isolation than say North Korea over the long term, but it would be a long, difficult period in which the average Russian will be much poorer and less able to access affluence elsewhere in the world. This reality *may* be acceptable to Putin, but I seriously doubt the remaining Oligarchs will stand for that situation long term.
* Doing this will put nuclear proliferation into overdrive. This is bad for everyone, but Russia is actually uniquely under threat from such a reality. Russia's nuclear forces are *key* to it remaining at the great power table. If dozens of other countries seek nuclear weapons it erodes Russia's dominant position in this field. Especially if those countries are not under the same economic embargoes a Pariah Russia will be.
* The above will also infuriate China. Like Russia, China enjoys something akin to a nuclear monopoly in its regional backyard. The first countries to go nuclear if Russia demonstrates clearly in Ukraine that the only way to not be nuked yourself is to have a credible deterrent will be Taiwan, South Korea and Japan - all countries that have a nuclear breakout capability.

I see those options listed as *most* influential to Russia *not* using nuclear weapons in Ukraine, but I believe their avoidance is still reliant on the US urging Ukraine to negotiate a 'face saving' settlement at some point. Recognition of Crimea and a demilitarisation zone in the East of Ukraine with rights guaranteed for Russian speakers - something akin to that.

This will be frustrating for Kyiv to accept but if it could be bundled in with a stronger security guarantee from the US or even a pathway to NATO membership - perhaps a recodified NATO that doesn't guarantee *any* alliance members' European territory beyond a certain longitude  - one that includes Khakhiv but not Donetsk/Luhansk? That geographic determinant has precedent - ie, European countries with territory outside of the 'North Atlantic Area' are not considered under the protection of NATO (eg. Falklands Islands).",3c0fbc378561f61b5fc68161293a9147ce8d798c,True,False,,,,,0,1653041760,,0,{},i9b6wix,False,t3_utk7b2,False,True,t3_utk7b2,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/utk7b2/potential_us_responses_to_the_russian_use_of/i9b6wix/,1653041771,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653012960.0,

[],False,,chowieuk,,,[],,,,text,t2_b230l,False,False,"&gt; Funny. Minimizing civilian losses, are we watching the same Russia forces in the same war?

They seem somewhat two faced in this regard.

In the first week or two of the war it was clear (to me at least) that they were holding back and being heavily restrained in terms of attacking civilian centres. Then you have things like the azovstal plant which they could have just rekt immediately if they genuinely gave no consideration to collateral damage. I'd suggest that their policy (of it exists) is far more nuanced than just 'bomb go boom'

Surely you can put a lot of it down to the serious lack of precision weaponry, reliance on artillery and lack of appropriately trained recruits? 

This conflict:

- is much more reported on that previous ones. This means you are seeing far more of the civilian suffering than you normally would, thus increasing the perception of horror.

- we care much more about those being attacked than we possibly have in 80 years. Thus we are much more emotionally invested and it increases the perception of horror.

- is being compared to a 'western war' because that's what we're used to. As it's 'less professional' and on the ground rather than just being distant air raids, that completely changes the face of events and how we see them. It's much more up close and personal, and the armies are frankly less competent and able to obtain objectives without collateral damage anyway. 

Those three factors alone massively escalate the 'horror/ extremity' with which we interpret everything. How does this conflict compare to other 'non western' wars? Because frankly i have no idea. They're barely reported on. Even here the only comparison is generally with western wars/doctrine etc

&gt; You think they struck untold numbers of hospitals and clinics for weeks, yet didn’t bother to strike the Neptune factory until the day after the Moskva was sunk - you think that force has any concern for civilians?

1. It's possible they never saw the neptune as an actual threat, or any other number of strategic reasons. I think you're relying heavily on confirmation bias.

2. Collateral damage comes in far more forms than direct attacks. I know a lady who was in a maternity ward in Baghdad on the night the Iraq war started. There were 18 women there and only 5 babies left the ward, despite no bombs striking the hospital (luckily hers was one of them. Though she's now trying to flee yemen... so i guess karma got her). That's to say that the idea that wars can't be horrific if people aren't bombed is a false dichotomy. There are always vast numbers of victims of war that are never even recorded.",3ea38ca1cd4343da480a94665b3567d465a007a2,True,False,,,,,0,1653038827,,0,{},i9b37o1,False,t3_utk7b2,False,True,t1_i9awl98,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/utk7b2/potential_us_responses_to_the_russian_use_of/i9b37o1/,1653038842,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653010027.0,

Due to this, facilities in the Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Kharkiv regions in the north and north-east of Ukraine, as well as in the south and in the Donbas region, have been especially targeted by Moscow’s forces.

&gt; Thanks to the heroic efforts of Ukrainian maintenance crews, equipment has been restored at seven substations and 11 high-voltage lines. This made it possible to provide electricity to about two million consumers. However, a significant part of the Ukrainian population (about 760 000 consumers) still remained without electricity supply as of mid-April 2022.

Particularly in the Catholic tradition, I think there is a certain anxiety that a “suicide bomb” attack is equivalent to actual suicide because your own action is the proximate cause of your death. Theologically this is distinct from taking actions that will certainly result in death (e.g. pushing someone out of the way of a car knowing you will be hit instead) because someone else’s action is killing you. 

Whether or not this distinction is philosphically valid, I believe it does influence the style of martyrdom that you see in the west which idolizes last stands like Thermopylae over “kamikaze” style attacks.

Speaking of kamikazes, it is unarguable that different cultures result in radically different willingness to engage in suicide attacks. The Japanese arguably engaged in them far beyond their actual utility, in part because of the high value their culture places on self-sacrifice, as well as national myths about Japan’s primacy in the natural order of the universe. 

Clearly in most modern western militaries, you would have trouble staffing any position that was advertised as “certain death”, and even very dangerous combat roles would never be spoken of in those terms.

If the Russian use them tactically it will be to win the war.

The weapons would likely be used in airburst mode and outside settlements to minimise both radioactivity and civilian losses.

We simply have no response to that. As the author points out our nuclear response or a conventional attack on Russia would be akin to Bismarck's jibe of ""committing suicide in fear of death"".

Our conventional response in Ukraine would be extremely dangerous and almost certainly ineffective when faced with an opponent that uses nukes tactically (air campaign would take weeks to dismantle the air defence network; a land advance would be preempted by surface strikes on key communication nodes and would have to advance through irradiated areas to get to the front).

The very fact that we **have no response** to the tactical nuclear escalation makes it so attractive an option for Russia. All likely consequences are of a diolomatic-reputational-economic nature.

Taiwan isn't toast.   


China must pull of three miracles to successfully take Taiwan.   


1. It must cross the Taiwan straight, under anti-ship missile fire from the Taiwanese, and not loose too many of their armor transporting craft, because China will need armor to take Taiwan. 
2. It must perform landings on Taiwan, which has been preparing for such an event for 70 years. This will be a more difficult amphibious landing than has ever occured in history. 
3. It must march with its armor on Taiwanese cities, to decapitate the political leadership

[],False,,Whole_Collection4386,,,[],,,,text,t2_dnydc0oe,False,False,"&gt;At the core of all these alliances is a nuclear guarantee

I won’t deny that that’s an obviously integral part, but the sheer force of our Navy, Air Force, and Army just on conventional grounds is also *quite possibly* unparalleled on earth. However, the nuclear guarantee is something that can be deployed at any time with or without troops on the ground, whether via SLBMs, ICBMs, or missiles on a plane launched from Guam. Our willingness to use it is something that could *very easily* be “switched”, so to speak, on and off nearly instantaneously (albeit I won’t speak to the credibility of a threat of the use of nuclear weapons by us even if we are the only ones in history who have ever used nukes offensively) in response to the Taiwanese meeting some defense spending target.

&gt;really, the only way to make sure that card is in play is to have troops garrisoned in Taiwan, just like they are in Europe

I would argue we are more than capable of providing combat support without having troops in Guam, even kinetic action without troops there, particularly if we have naval ships in port.

&gt;If Taiwan is invaded and it’s done, clearly it’s too late to retaliate

Well, too late to deploy troops to seize positive control of the ground, *maybe*, however still not too late to provide naval and air kinetic support and MISO support. That said, it would be up to the Taiwanese to signal to us their willingness to defend their own territory by offering personnel or military spending so that we would decide to keep troops and other military forces around.

&gt;Sail everyone home immediately if Taiwan’s defense spending ever dips too low?

I mean, Taiwan *should* be offering up the personnel to reinforce US ground forces in country, optimally. So if they just decided to not have any personnel offered up, then yes, start packing up our stuff over the course of a months long process while having an in depth conversation and literally move them out. And while they are not holding up their end of the deal, if the PLAN decided to come on by during this period of non-compliance, we would literally physically move our ships aside so they could park their ships in port and take control of the country like the Taiwanese government would be implying is their desire by not upholding their end of the defense agreements.

&gt;What would that say about our seriousness?

It would say that we aren’t kidding about the legalism of our treaties.

&gt;Clearly we’re not serious about fighting a nuclear war over Taiwan

Well, if the Taiwanese aren’t willing to provide any military forces to meet the *minimum*, much less provide additional forces voluntarily to signal their definitive willingness to fight and die for their country and sovereignty, then we shouldn’t launch nuclear war over that. It is just that straightforward. Part of a “willingness” to fight nuclear war means actually being willing to fight nuclear war, regardless what the Chinese assess or what we “signal”. It does not mean bluffing. It means fighting that nuclear war even if the Chinese don’t believe us, because they think some funding argument means we aren’t serious. So that means we stick to it. If the Taiwanese meet some spending target or personnel target, then we fight that nuclear war even if the Chinese call our bluff. If they don’t, we don’t fight that nuclear war. The philosophical principle doesn’t hold much weight against the force of the nuclear bomb ripping the molecules comprising the target apart. 

&gt;is it really plausible we’d do it at 2.1% when we would not at 1.9%?

It is if we actually hold to that notional agreement. At that point, the Chinese can call our bluff and gravely miscalculate or they can be overly cautious and not make a move. It’s on them to read into it however they want. That aside, the point of “willingness” to do something means, again, willingness to do it regardless if the enemy calls a bluff or doesn’t.

&gt;free-rides so shamelessly, and why Taiwan might

Well, Ukraine is seeing what happens from not being a member of a formal military alliance that beholds them and us. Because they didn’t join an alliance that we would *promise* to defend them in response to some aggression, they aren’t getting troops on ground, they aren’t getting nuclear umbrellas, they aren’t getting heavy naval support, they aren’t getting air support, etc. The 2% target of NATO is also notably not binding in treaty though. That would be a fundamental difference in this notional situation. The Taiwanese wouldn’t be “asked diplomatically” to spend a certain amount. They would be given a hard line and if they didn’t abide by the provisions of the treaty, then there wouldn’t be an active treaty. So if the Taiwanese really wanted to call some “bluff” and free-ride, we would show them that we are literally packing our bags and if they don’t straighten up by the time we’re done packing, we’re gone, because clearly it means they are not interested in protecting themselves.",9286e1963373ea2493fbea0c304afeca6721cd84,True,False,,,,,0,1653018412,,0,{},i9acciu,False,t3_utdgmr,False,True,t1_i9a1nj2,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/utdgmr/taiwan_doesnt_need_a_formal_us_security_guarantee/i9acciu/,1653018427,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652989612.0,

The author is a legit source of info and I thought this was better than any other article on this subject. 

-----------------

&gt; * The Russian leadership has also used nuclear threats to signal its displeasure with the expansion of NATO, suggesting it will deploy nuclear-capable missiles near Finland and Sweden if they join the alliance.

&gt; * Many of these nuclear threats are signals, meant to politically coerce. 

&gt; * But what if Russian President Vladimir Putin decided to use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine to change the apparent negative direction of the Russian invasion there? 

Four response options seem at least plausible: 

1. the West could use a nuclear weapon or weapons against Russian forces, in or outside Ukraine; 

2. it could conduct a conventional military attack on Russian forces, in or outside Ukraine;
3. it could continue its current policy of supplying Ukraine with weapons while avoiding direct conflict with the Russian military; 
4. or it could press Ukraine to settle the conflict, on terms that give Russia a face-saving out.

&gt; * Responding in-kind to a Russian nuclear attack and caving to nuclear coercion are clearly unwise, but the other options have risks and uncertainties that make one thing obvious: Russian use of a nuclear weapon or weapons in Ukraine would greatly increase the likelihood of direct NATO-Russia conflict.

&gt; * If Russia did use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, they would almost certainly be non-strategic nuclear weapons.

&gt; * Russia’s threshold for the use of non-strategic nuclear weapons may be below that of its escalatory policy, given its deep reserve of thousands of non-strategic nuclear weapons and the dual conventional-nuclear capabilities of all its production-line missiles. These realities and Russian military writings suggest a war-fighting role for non-strategic nuclear weapons.

&gt; * Regardless of reason, let us assume Russia has used a nuclear weapon in Ukraine. How do the West and the United States in particular react?

&gt; * Given the potential global consequences of a nuclear war between Russia and the United States and NATO, striking targets inside Russia with nuclear weapons is unlikely to be viewed by the US president as a viable option.

&gt; * If the Russian use of nuclear weapons targeted Ukraine’s ability to fight, one targeting criteria to consider would be those targets that negate any Russian advantage gained by its use of nuclear weapons. A second option would be to target the platform used by Russia to carry out the strike—a platform that would almost certainly be based inside Russia itself.

&gt; * In a third type of response, the United States and NATO could stay the course and continue to provide military aid to the Ukrainians without escalating the war with attacks against Russia or Russian military forces. The core of this response is the realization that the current trajectory in the Russia-Ukraine conflict favors Ukraine and that Russia’s use of nuclear weapons is an act of desperation.

&gt; * Coercion by the United States and NATO against Ukraine to force a negotiated settlement would be tantamount to a 180-degree shift in policy because of Russia’s use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine. This would set an extremely dangerous precedent going forward, not only for Russia but for other world actors, especially in the Asian-Pacific, that could see a low cost of using nuclear weapons as an argument for them playing a greater role in pursuing their own geopolitical goals.

&gt; * If Putin decides to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, it will represent an unparalleled level of barbarity and an eschewing of international norms. It will also present NATO and the United States with complicated policy options, all of which have potential global consequences.

&gt; * …the two extremes, responding in kind and pushing for a settlement, are unwise given the escalatory risks or potential for establishing destructive and unstable patterns of behavior. The two other options—escalating conventionally against Russia or staying the course—each have their own risks and levels of uncertainty.

[],False,,stult,,,[],,,,text,t2_43rkt,False,False,"You have to look at things in context. Bucha is only one example of a larger pattern. It is no more proof of genocide than a single instance of the Nazis rounding up and executing all of the Jews in a single village would have been. But just as with the Nazis, it is not an isolated incident. 

Consider the definition of genocide from the 1948 Genocide Convention:

&gt; [A]ny of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:

&gt; (a) Killing members of the group;

&gt; (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;

&gt; (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;

&gt; (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;

&gt; (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.


The Russian leadership has gotten their people riled up with rhetoric that calls for the destruction of Ukrainian national identity and culture and its replacement with a Russified culture friendly to Moscow. Meanwhile, they released a poorly trained and controlled army on a civilian population with zero effort to prevent or punish war crimes. They have done nothing to restrain their soldiers on the ground when they have murdered and raped civilians. Instead Putin issued medals to the unit that committed the atrocities in Bucha. In fact, the strategy determined at the highest levels of the Russian military and government includes the intentional killing of civilians on a massive scale via indiscriminate bombing and even targeted bombing of civilian facilities such as hospitals. They have rounded up Ukrainian civilians in occupied areas and deported them to distant areas in Russia on a massive scale, bringing in Russians to replace them (at least in Kherson that I know of).

Forced deportation of civilians to a context where they can no longer maintain their national identity. Physical destruction of their homes and civilian infrastructure. Mass murder via bombing campaigns. Replacing the existing population with ethnic Russians. Widespread rape that is endorsed by Putin himself via the awarding of medals to the units in Bucha. This all looks like a systematic effort to destroy the Ukrainian people.

You could argue that these are not part of a systematic campaign to destroy the Ukrainian people, but rather a side effect of a brutally violent campaign intended to exert political control, of which the destruction of the Ukrainian people is an unfortunate side effect, and thus that the requisite intent to destroy the Ukrainians is not present. Yet there has been a large volume of rhetoric from the Russians denying the right of the Ukrainian people to exist and calling for the destruction of Ukrainian people as separate from the Russians, so it seems disingenuous to give them the benefit of the doubt when a large number of their actions seem to reflect that genocidal intent. “Denazification is inevitably also De-Ukrainianization.” - Timofei Sergeitsev in RIA Novosti (a **state-owned** Russian media outfit).

It's worth remembering that the Nazis did not start out trying to kill every single Jew. They considered many plans that would have involved removing the Jewish population en masse from Europe, which would have been terrible but obviously less horrific than the actual ""Final Solution"" that they eventually settled on. Meaning, just because the Russians perhaps started out not exactly planning to commit genocide doesn't mean that the combination of their escalating rhetoric and growing desperation hasn't driven them to cross that line.

I think this article has a pretty decently neutral take on it, although it is a few weeks old and perhaps the author would lean more toward calling it genocide after the revelations of the past few weeks:

https://www.justsecurity.org/80998/is-genocide-occurring-in-ukraine-an-expert-explainer-on-indicators-and-assessments/

Its primary point is that whether you call it genocide or not doesn't really matter in the near term. The horrific atrocities which are undeniably being committed right now deserve precisely the same response from the international community as clear genocide would. The author argues that whether those atrocities arise to the level of genocide in the aggregate is something that probably can't be determined with any objectivity until after the active conflict has died down enough to allow proper collection of evidence and more thorough outside investigations. And that's a fair point. There is a difference between saying, ""Hey, this sure looks like genocide"" and making the legal determination in the ICJ or ICC that genocide has committed. Right now we are at the ""hey what the fuck"" stage, and there is plenty of evidence to make raising the issue legitimate, even if there is still some doubt in some minds. One of the worst failures of the Allies during WW2 was their refusal to recognize, acknowledge, or actively work to address the fact that the Germans were committing genocide against the Jews, Romas, and others until they liberated the death camps and were forced to confront the horrific and undeniable reality. We shouldn't wait to speak up until it is too late. 

In any case, the most favorable interpretation of the facts to the Russians sure does make it look like they are working their way up from regular ol' vanilla war crimes toward committing genocide, and we should all be damned concerned about that.",9380eefaa57da34fefbb33a433f20544a91c70fb,True,False,,,,,0,1653016444,,0,{},i9a8sqp,False,t3_ut1tmt,False,True,t1_i99z81i,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ut1tmt/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_19_2022/i9a8sqp/,1653016462,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652987644.0,

Do you know the Chinese armies took model more like the Japanese than the Russian? Older Chinese armies, that is from the time of WWII to perhaps the 80s were more Japanese than they are Soviets. Because China, like Japan though Japan by choice and China because it has no choice, are infantry based armies whereas the Soviet Red Army is a combined arms army with their artillery as the arms of decision. The Chinese army is mostly infantry, with some limited indirect support. They aren't the same shit, they aren't even in the same bathroom. The Chinese focus is on infantry manuver and leveraging opponents through quick and rapid advances of infantry under guise, whether it is terrain, day/night, or weather, it infiltrate behind opponent lines and then launches probing attacks to find weakness before concentrating forces when they find the weakness.

The Red Army is a combined arms army with heavy direct fire and indirect fire support, and as previously state with artillery as their arms of decisions. Their infantry are spotter, and screens. The Red Army is a armor wave preceded by withering fire from tubes. The PLA gives monkey calls at night and surprise you because they are behind you and around you and you think they are throwing a human wave at you.

[],False,,BeondTheGrave,,,[],,,,text,t2_4zro2,False,False,"The same effect could also have been accomplished, albeit in a bit slower of a fashion, with a fording attack developing into a battle on the far side of the river. BTRs BMPs and BRDMs can all swim unassisted with almost zero preparation (I think the BTR may just have to raise a snorkel?) and tanks can ford with as little as an hour of preparation assuming A) that the bottom conditions are favorable for a crossing and B) the tank's seals, gaskets, and fording equipment is well maintained enough to survive the crossing. *Sustaining* the action across the river is an entirely different issue, softskineds cannot operation in this fashion and large armored movements in muddy terrain will eventually tear the ground up so bad further crossings become risky. But for the initial attack there is zero reason why the forward combat detachment need stop. 

All this is to say that, IMO, Russia failed in much the same way that they've failed this entire war. Soviet doctrine was heavily based on the existence of a strong forward detachment and combat reconnaissance patrol which would go out and gather intel about the enemy's disposition. Their job was either to find the enemy, fight them, and shape the battle the rest of the regiment would have to fight, or to brush aside meager resistance so it wouldn't trip up the fast moving regiment, or in the worst case to get their ass blow off so the regiment doesnt have to. In the Soviet conception of the river crossing, the forward detachment would have already won the battle for the far shore (probably they wouldn't have even stopped when they reached the water obstacle, especially one of the size and depth of the river in question in this IRL case) before the first bridge slipped into the water. Instead the Russians skipped this step. There was no forward detachment. No clearing operation was executed. And so Ukrainian observers were able to preplan fires against obvious crossing points. This has been a consistent problem with the RuAF and probably stems from their shift to a BTG structure. The BTG has been given the same job as an entire Soviet Regiment, but whereas Soviet forward detachments were in a multi-company to battalion strength, Russian BTGs have at best a platoon of reconnaissance elements and at worst literally nothing. They are totally incapable of providing the shaping effect called for in Soviet style doctrine.
