During the holodomor the Soviets under Stalin intentionally starved 2-5 million Ukraine peasants to death by confiscating their complete harvests. They then moved ethnic Russians into the depopulated areas. That is why Luhansk and Donetsk are Russian speaking. Stalin also moved huge numbers is Russians into the Baltics. Hitler planned to replace Slavs in the conquered Soviet lands with true Arians so he then too could claim it as a part of the Reich.
Age old political gambit. Depopulate then replace with your own people and of course claim it for that reason. 
Russia moved recently large numbers of Ukrainians to Russia. If Russia wins in Ukraine more Russians will be resettled in those areas. You get the drift? Go to the farm and kill everyone on it, then put your own people there so you can claim it as your own? When people get deported they get redistributed over a large area where contact with other deportees is hard to establish.

Hitler thought the same way. He had planned to remove Slavs from the freshly conquered countries and replace them with what he called true Arians. Some people are stupid enough to swallow that reasoning. I recently listened to some West EU politicians calling for a Ukraine compromise to kiss goodby to Luhansk and Donetsk, since many there are  ethnic Russians. After the holodomor the soviets replaced the 2-5 million Ukrainians in those regions with ethnic Russians. Now they are claiming them as independent republics.
