The split between him and his Kurdish voters happened after the siege of Kobane, long before the election.

Misfit junior officers? What made you think that? Erdogan no doubt took advantage of the situation to get rid of most of his opposition and to purge the country of Gülenists. But the existence of Gülenists inside the military was hardly a secret and the fight between AKP and them was out in the open, so imo it was quite clear who did the coup. But Erdogan probably caught wind of the attempt before it happened and made a trap for them. Or he faked the whole thing just to get rid of the Gülenist.

For example due to China declaring no first use and on might of its own massive arsenal the US team at first deems it enough of a deterrent. China to counter US displays resolve by detonating nukes as tests first and later near Hawaii. 

Following such both sides might devolve to attacking increasingly important targets.
