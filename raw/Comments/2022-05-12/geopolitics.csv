The issue Finland and Sweden (Finland in particular) pose to Russia is that they open up the Russian heartland to easy access and this is especially important because of the radar systems Russia puts on the arctic - threatening those is one step short of placing nukes.

I don't think anything really changes wrt to NATO or Russia but it essentially ups the ante dramatically in case of a conflict. I don't see any other way than Russia flattening both of them asap, especially Finland. Having those radars at risk is a grave threat (same reason why the US reacts more in Sout America - American radars are more positions in the north pole since that's the closest vector of attack. Hyper sonic glide vehicles change that). 

I suspect Finland and Sweden won't really change too much of their defense structure beyond regular amp up of drills and etc - if they place missiles or the dual use mk 41 launchers, that's essentially the Cuban missile crisis all over again. As long as they remain the defense forces they are, I don't think much changes. 

And Russian North is also lightly defended due to the geography. Finland opens up this entire area.

Russia may have more total conscripts and ""reservists"" it can theoretically muster, but that's unlikely to matter considering Russia must also defend exponentially more territory and shares borders with multiple military rivals. Germany, quite frankly, doesn't face a true long term conventional threat to its sovereignty barring some wild changes to the geopolitical balance of Europe. 

On the other hand, Germany is a geographically small country when compared to the US, UK, China, and India.

""The Russian invasion of Ukraine marks a turning point in history. It brings to a close the chapter that began at the end of the Cold War, when Western countries tried to integrate Russia into an international rules-based order. Russia under President Vladimir Putin has become a pariah state. Much as it did when facing down the Soviet Union during the Cold War, the United States has taken the lead in countering Putin‘s blatant attack on civilization.

This effort requires a global alliance. The partnership among countries that commit to international law and its foundational texts, the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, should comprise countries from all continents. The international community should not be a euphemism for the West. The perception that there continues to be a conflict between “the West” and “the East” allows too many countries to sit on the fence. The fault line really lies between those who seek to reaffirm a principled, global moral and legal order, and those who do not. A new global alliance should stand tall in its uncompromising efforts to protect international law, international humanitarian law, and human rights law.

Many countries support the U.S.-led response to Putin’s war, but some do so grudgingly. Too many governments see the conflict as a return to the days of the Cold War, when they were forced to choose sides. They imagine that what is at stake is the collision of two geopolitical rivals, not a fundamental question of principle. This is deeply unfortunate. Russia’s aggression should not be seen as ushering in a new Cold War but simply as what it is: the worst act of aggression in Europe since the end of World War II and a brutal violation of international law.

History will not turn in a positive direction on its own. The United States, which has at times undermined international law in its foreign policy choices, should commit to the upholding of the norms and laws that define the international rules-based order. The burden of addressing violations of international law has to be divided more evenly. Germany‘s new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has described this moment as a Zeitenwende, a historical turning point. Along with other European countries, Germany needs to step up to the plate and significantly increase its defense spending, improve its readiness to help maintain stability in and around Europe, and take on a leadership role in resolving international conflicts.""",504b9ba83d0071f88274f14ff76d6fff6bd43b32,True,False,,,,,0,1652365233,,0,{},i8bklnp,True,t3_uo25or,False,True,t3_uo25or,/r/geopolitics/comments/uo25or/the_war_in_ukraine_will_be_a_historic_turning/i8bklnp/,1652365252,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1652336433.0

It's hilarious how the US gets its panties in a knot about Putin buying FB ads to interfere in an election. Meanwhile the US spent $5B on supporting one faction in Ukraine - that would be the equivalent of Russia spending $64 billion to interfere with US politics. Imagine if Russia spent that kind of a fortune telling Republicans that *they* alone were the true Americans, and Democrats were traitorous saboteurs. 

The US can at any time say that NATO is not expanding. Ukraine has valid security needs, but NATO is not the only option. France has offered to provide bilateral defense guarantees, and other countries can participate. The US is the only PNG, and for good reason. 

The US could have offered Zelensky aid and personal protection to implement Minsk. He needed the ability to control Azov and force them to stop fighting. 

Instead, Biden appointed the exact same person who had been the US lead engineer of the 2014 coup. He dragged her out of her [Raytheon-funded pro-war think tank](https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-02-CNAS-Heinz-and-Jung.pdf) so she could set about her agenda of putting bases as far east as possible. 

Then last fall, the US sent its first troops to Ukraine for ""exercises"", and that set the clock ticking - Ukraine wouldn't have to join NATO to get a deployment of US troops and weapons. Ukraine wouldn't have to join NATO to get a few Patriot batteries. 

Once you have Cheney's PNAC crowd in the State department, war won't be long in coming. That's what they're there for. That's their payday.

This of course is not the case with Russia. Their doctrine has always been to use nukes if they feel the existence of the state is threatened. It's difficult what could be a more likely scenario to unleash Russian nukes than US troops fighting them in territory they now consider part of Russia.

[],False,,bnav1969,,,[],,,,text,t2_rqa20,False,False,"He did though. The minsk agreement was essentially to settle the civil war in donbass which is a genuine civil war. The history of Donbass is kind of unique - it was a Soviet ""proletariat"" miner region and to this day, the rebels wave the hammer and sickle. A lot of this war was triggered by the maidan regime change which essentially brought in a Ukrainian chauvinistic government into power than banned the Russian language and started attacking Russian culture (for example banning the victory flag which is a big deal).

Western media lies a lot but essentially Maidan was heavily supported in Western Ukraine and heavily hated in Eastern Ukraine. The deposed president Yanukovych won 80% of Eastern Ukraine and 20% of the west and Poreshenko (the guy after Maidan) had essentially a reverse result.

So in a lot of pro Russia areas (like Odessa and Crimea) there was counter Maidan protests. There were a lot of literal neo-nazis in Maidan and they started attacking pro Russia protestors which devolved into riots in many towns. In Odessa, ukronazis (not joking and not saying all Ukrainians are Nazis but there is a heavy Nazi / Banderite element in Ukraine) locked the pro Russians into a trade building and burned them alive (about 50 people were killed). 

Then eventually things led to Donbass war (which wasn't triggered by Russia but they helped obviously). In the Donbass war Ukrainian forces indiscriminately shelled a lot of civilians in the East (who were as you'd guess Russian). 

All of these factors is why Putin called the war in Donbass a genocide (an exaggeration certainly but what he says &amp; he said it in 2014). If you want to get into Putin further, his famous quote about disaster of Soviet collapse is often truncated - this is full quote.

 —""First and foremost it is worth acknowledging that the demise of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century,” Putin said. “As for the Russian people, it became a genuine tragedy. Tens of millions of our fellow citizens and countrymen found themselves beyond the fringes of Russian territory""

So to summarize, Russia and Putin considered this a genocide level act (in reality ethnic suppression but hyperbole is needed). Minsk 2 was part of the deals to better the situations for the Russians in Ukraine against a chauvinistic ultranationalist government in a truly divided country by federalizing it. This ultranationalist government was being armed and trained by NATO +US, which has generally shown a desire to destabilize and attack other states (Iraq, Libya, Kosovo, Bosnia, and dozens of color revolutions). Minsk 2 failed mainly due to the Ukrainian government and they refused to negotiate it further after 2014. So Putin essentially used the ""Right to Protect"" invoked by NATO in Bosnia and Libya to save the Russians from genocide. 

So Minsk 2 isn't exactly the cacus belli but rather the sign that negotiations won't work. And Putin has repeatedly claimed the genocide claims to justify his actions. If you read his declaration of war speech that's a huge part if it.

A complete &amp; utter Ukrainian victory. Russia started this fight &amp; Ukraine &amp; the West can end it. 

&gt;Regarding NATO, the US has pulled out of all the important cold War treaties, including the ABM and IMF treaties - Russia was shocked by the INF withdrawal and has repeatedly suggested re negotiating it. But no, nothing.

Do you mean make less competitive? The Germans aren't competing for low quality &amp; low cost goods, the market can bare that cars become more expensive.

How is this relavent to your previous point?

Well Europe is free to buy the best weapons at the lowest costs in competitive bidding process when they rearm. If they pick American arms it's because they're the best or the cheapest which seems like extraordinarily good reasons to win a contract.

While the economic argument is obvious - fighting a war on home turf is expensive and impedes economic output - I don't think it's entirely relevant for the Ukrainians ability to wage war.

Before the war Ukraine had a GDP slightly bigger than half that of Denmark, a country of 5,8 mio. citizens (Ukraine, 44,1). So Ukraine is really poor to begin with.

Besides the fact that the western part of Ukraine is fairly untouched by war keeping Ukraine supplied and armed is not going to be a significant drag on the west. It's a part of the total bill of the war but the effects of the sanctions on oil, gas and inflation weighs much heavier than providing arms and economic help for Ukraine.  

Regarding the economy and manpower for the army I think the migration argument is insignificant. BBC estimates that 6 mio. people have left the Ukraine. But the people fleeing are mostly children (50%),  women and the elderly.

Russia supported the Donbass separatists in the negotiations (not unlike how NATO supports the Bosnian Muslims over the Croats or Serbs). Russia pulled it's heavy forces out of the Donbass as part of Minsk after they ran a counter offensive on the Ukrainians in 2014 - this was in response to the successful Ukrainian offensive against the separatists. The Russians followed this pretty well until now.

Minsk fell apart and eventually led to Minsk 2. While there were violations on both sides, it was mostly the Ukrainians who did it. It's quite well known to anyone following the conflict before it because the current thing that Ukrainian forces in the East were mostly Banderite ultranationalist battalions. They were (and still are) extremely liberal with the shelling of the Donbass, which has led to 14k death Donbass residents including 6k civilians (this is where the Russian ""Right to Protect"" claims come in). The shelling was mostly done by the Ukrainian forces, although the rebels responded in kind. Despite the rhetoric most of the rebels lacked a lot of heavy artillery. 

Zelensky and Ukraine didn't really implement minsk, requiring the rebels to disarm before autonomy which went against the agreement.
