The vast majority of UKR equipment is still native. I'm sure well over 90%. Most of the aid came in the form of ATGMs and MANPADS.

&gt;US Congress just casually threw $40bln to Ukraine, and it will keep doing so until Russia loses.

Nah. You didn't look up the breakdowns of that aid package and just went off of the headlines. The US military aid package to UKR until now was only $3.5 billion. For the first 2 months of the war, there were several ""waves"" of aid of only hundreds of millions each. 

$19.7 billion of the new ""40"" is going to the US military, and only $6 billion is for direct military aid to UKR. [training, equipment, weapons and support] The remainder of the bill is for humanitarian and economic aid. 

$5 billion from the bill isn't even for UKR at all, it's to USAID and the State Dept to fund their global humanitarian programs. $9 billion is for an ""economic support fund"". $11 billion is just authorization for Biden to send more aid if and when he chooses in the future, it's basically a line of credit. 

Since Russia's offensives have been ground down and there is no real threat to UKR anymore, you can expect the US enthusiasm for the ""no news"" war of attrition to fade away, especially with the US economy in the shitter and the election coming up.

[],False,,TheHuscarl,,,[],,,,text,t2_amv0e,False,False,"Nuclear use is almost certainly irrational, ""tactical nuclear weapons"" even more so. It has been pointed out by a fair few nuclear weapons experts, such as Pavel Podvig, that from a practical military standpoint, nuclear weapons are not that helpful compared to their massive downsides, which means if they must be used, they have to be used on targets where the impact is high enough to somehow try and justify the associated costs. In short, you have to use them on cities to actually get conflict-ending value out of them. But then, if you use them against cities, you are inherently going to be hit with either counter-strikes or massive retaliation via other means, therefore why use one to begin with? Enabling first strike doctrine is not inherently irrational because it provides a means of deterrence (if I see you preparing to nuke me, I will nuke you first, so don't even start). As for limited nuclear war hypothesis, I think those are bunk. Regardless, if those scenarios are realistic, I presume that most if not all governments involved are taking those into account and making decisions accordingly.  


&gt;My point is, considering risk and concluding ""Ukraine isn't important enough to risk a hot war with Russia"" does not make one pro-Putin, pro-inaction, an appeaser, or any of the other ridiculous insults people are throwing around now that in 10 years will be recognized as absurd.

This statement just validates the strategy of nuclear blackmail. Again, I don't like this rhetoric, but I think it is legitimate. If Russia takes Ukraine free of cost because they flashed the threat of nuclear weapons, they will see that it is effective and they will do it again. Irresponsible behavior should not be rewarded. If anything, more even than Ukrainian sovereignty, which is important and should be protected, we are supplying assistance to the Ukrainians to demonstrate that states cannot use nuclear threats to bully their way to international gain. We do the same thing with North Korea. So far, the Western approach to this has been moderated and responsible. I would strongly argue that nothing that the US or the West as a whole has done so far has \*significantly\* increased the likelihood of hot war (not to mention the Russians themselves are clearly unwilling to engage in such a conflict, else they would not be rattling the nuclear saber so hard to prevent military intervention). We live in a world in which Soviet and American jets have literally engaged in air combat. Weapons shipments and intelligence sharing are par for the course in world power rivalries. This also seems to be as far as the West really wants to go. Military intervention is clearly off the table for all policymakers involved, even if some radical voices are calling for it. But if you cave to Russia in this context, you normalize this behavior. How you will respond next when the DPRK threatens Seoul with a nuke? Capitulate? After all, is Seoul really worth the US having t fight a hot war with the DPRK?

&gt;&gt; He's a Russian shill with nothing valuable to say.

Thank you. The dude still lusts after the ""great game"" of empire-building and longs for its return. He sees Russia doing it, and says ""hey, Russia has every right to act this way!""

I wrote a lengthy takedown of him in KIA2, but that sub is private so I can't link it. Here were my bullet points summarizing his ideology and why it's nonsense:

&gt;Russia is not a great power.

&gt;&gt;Russia's economy is only 11th in the world, and 68th in GDP per capita. It is a poor country that relies on oil/gas exports to not be utterly destitute. The states of California, Texas, and New York INDIVIDUALLY have bigger economies than Russia. China's economy is 10x bigger. The US's is about 15x. 

&gt;No, ""Great Powers"" do not have some ""right"" to dominate neighbors

&gt;&gt;There is no such thing as ""rights"" on a nation-state level. Might makes right. (and the US/EU + allies like Japan control the global ""might"" right now) So the premise that Ukraine is somehow the property of Russia, unable to choose for itself how to conduct foreign policy or join the EU or NATO, is just some bullshit Mearsheimer pulled out of his ass.

&gt;There as no ""unipolar moment"" and US foreign policy has never held spreading democracy as a significant goal

&gt;&gt;This ""unipolar moment"" he speaks about is a fiction. The world was never ""unipolar"" as the EU was a strong policy bloc just like the US, and the US worked in a cooperative way through alliances, instead of ever just ""going it alone"" as Mearsheimer foolishly imagines. Further, while the idea of promoting democracy always sits in the background of State Department hopes and dreams, it has never been something the US actually made any concerted effort to do.

&gt;The United States did nothing in Ukraine. Ukraine chose to come to the West on its own.

&gt;&gt;There is no point to debating this. It's obvious to anyone that Euromaidan was a genuine Ukrainian movement that reflected the will of the Ukrainian people, not some foreign plot. Anyone who thinks otherwise can't be reasoned with. 

&gt;Russia has no right to dominate and control Ukraine, and Ukraine ought to be free to determine its own path

&gt;&gt;Self-determination is a basic human right and component of natural law. The whole concept of slavery is that 1 person may dominate another.

[],False,,_-null-_,,,[],,,,text,t2_148ahw,False,False,"That's the main point of disagreement here. Does Russia want an empire? Some say no, some say yes. Clearly the leadership is heavily nationalistic and attaches particular value to Russian majority regions (such as Crimea). But that does not mean they necessarily want to expand into the lands of other nafions. At the same time, recently Putin has been reviving some old claims about how Ukraine and Russia are part of a broader east slavic civilisation and should be politically united. Additionally it seems like Russia is moving to annex Kherson oblast and there are voices calling for the Russification of Ukrainian territories. These new developments speak of an imperial project in the making. Mearsheimer appears to be dismissive of these things, in a recent interview he once again blamed the west of perceiving Russia as a power set on imperialist conquest.

It seems to me quite plausible that Putin himself and a few members of his inner circle have developed a taste for imperialism, while the Russian nation in general is only hostile to NATO out of longtime principle and was quite satisfied with the post-2014 status quo. However, the regime needed the threat of NATO expansion to mobilise the public opinion for this war. If Russia received a guarantee that Ukraine would not join NATO, would have they still tried to conquer it like this? You can argue that a diplomatic solution was impossible because Russia demanded way too much influence over Ukraine from the beginning. But my issue here is that we didn't even get to the negotiating table. The west said ""Russia does not have any right to dictate the foreign policy of neighbouring countries"".

Ukraine has not totally mobilized. If they did, they'd have over a million troops active and deployed right now. Do they? Obviously not.

Ukraine lacked the logistical capability for a total mobilization, and after the early days of the war which were marked by uncertainty and fear, it quickly became clear that total mobilization would not be necessary, and the press for recruitment massively slowed. It's easy to see this by the fact that UKR basically told foreign volunteers lacking in military experience to not bother coming. Those who came anyway were given busywork jobs in joke tier units of civil defense, not front line combat units.

Military aid to UKR has been limited to lots of certain types of weapons, like MANPADS and ATGMs, where a relatively small number of weapons can make a disproportionate impact. 

Critically, military aid to UKR has NOT been designed to help UKR in a total mobilization by outfitting new infantry divisions. Instead, aid in that area has been relatively limited and more along the lines of replacing losses.

It was entirely premised on ""Ukrainians will not fight if we can just drive down a bunch of roads with unsupported units, creating the impression of rapid advance but without any real military capacity backing it up"", which is idiotic.

3. Russia's initial invasion was repulsed with heavy losses everywhere it reached a defended area. The only ""gains"" it made was just driving over undefended areas and occupying them. The Russian losses were heavy, and within a matter of days they had to pull back and change strategies since their concept of a ""lightning war"" had been an embarrassing failure.

4. Being a contrarian doesn't make you look smarter. Contrarians are wrong the large majority of the time.

""if only the Russians were able to win those unwinnable battles they tried to fight""

Trying to leapfrog to Hostomel airport was a stupid failure that got properly punished. The West is only in awe at the survival of the Ukrainian air force because we think along the lines of forces like NATO or the Israelis, who WOULD easily wipe out a smaller air force in this situation. It's utter ignorance of the massive failings and inadequacies of the Russian Air Force, which was never intended to play a major offensive role under Soviet doctrine. The Russians didn't even hit a bunch of major air ports for a long time, and UKR obviously moved their jets onto rough FARPs like roads, which WAS part of Soviet doctrine.

https://www.csis.org/analysis/next-step-us-aid-ukraine-operational-contractors

&gt; *  The next step in U.S. aid should be, and likely will be, to provide battlefield contractors in Ukraine to maintain these systems and train Ukrainians on their use.

&gt; * There's nothing inherently wrong with the Soviet/Russian standard except supply availability. 

&gt; * Unfortunately, the current plan of helping the Ukrainian military assimilate these new systems will not work. Even before the conflict, its maintainers struggled to keep equipment in the field. 

&gt; * The solution is battlefield contractors (or operational contractor support, as the Department of Defense formally refers to the activities). 

&gt; * During the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, contractors provided thousands of personnel for training and maintenance. (Note: Armed security contractors received most of the attention, but they were few in number and are not at issue here.) For example, in Iraq in 2013 (the first year data is available), there were roughly 7,500 personnel providing maintenance and training services.

&gt; * Saudi Arabia, which has acquired large amounts of U.S. military equipment over the years, has had thousands of contractors in country to help maintain and operate the systems.

&gt; * The use of operational contractors thus has several beneficial aspects. First, it strengthens Ukrainian military capabilities by helping to field well-maintained and expertly operated systems. Second, it avoids the embarrassment and loss of combat power arising from equipment being sidelined because of a lack of operators and maintenance. Finally, it meets the popular demand to do more to help Ukraine without taking the step of putting boots on the ground with all the risks that entails.",af57b5a3131d7af1a19f4d8b9ff3c7d3a622f27a,True,False,,,,,0,1652396581,,0,{},i8dqqv1,False,t3_unzexc,False,False,t3_unzexc,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/unzexc/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_12_2022/i8dqqv1/,1652396592,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652367781.0

&gt; People write laws, including constitution. People rewrite them. That's the baseline of where you should start.

And then people follow them. And if they want them changed then they pressure their representatives or they elect new ones.

Democracies don't generally engage in violent coups. It's not broadly recommended. The fact that trump isn't behind bars is a damning indictment of the politicisation of the American judicial system, not the norm.

And again. Laws voted on under direct threat of violence are not democratic either. Presumably you'd argue that the crimean legislature's actions were illegitimate yes?

&gt; People on Maidan were not mob, they had legitimate grievances with their government. 

They may have had legitimate grievances, but by the end they were a mob. That many were armed and they were making speeches threatening an armed coup..... is not acceptable democratic activity, especially given that by that point they had already won. The system was in theory working as it was supposed to.

&gt; Government addressed those grievances by beating up and shooting people. At that point the Government stopped being legitimate, and people redressed their grievances with the means they had available.

There were democratic and legal means available, but instead they resorted to riding roughshod over those rules. Again. At this point the security services/police were withdrawing/had withdrawn. Yanukovych had been defeated.

&gt; Who does? Just the people? Or should the president, and his cronies follow it too? The whole ""It's OK for presidents to do bad things, just not the people"" is lost on me. It's such an anti-democratic way of thinking.

It's not OK. He should have been held accountable based on the laws of the land. He should have been impeached within the clear constitutional framework available and then based on the evidence available prosecuted if he'd broken any laws.

However, elected officials should not be fleeing for their own safety, nor should they be subject to intimidation. That's an absurd scenario. He'd lost support, his party members had defected. He no longer had the support of the military.  Extrajudicial justice isn't justice, nor is something justice just because a majority of the people support it. The number of yanukovych ministers who were conveniently murdered after the fact is not justice for instance.

&gt; So you insist that people follow the law, just not the presidents, because they never do?

I was responding to the implication that yanukovych was unique in his being corrupt and that maidan somehow solved the problem. Sorry if this wasn't your implication.

&gt; People can hold 20000 Maidans for each subsequent corrupt president if they want until they find one they like, and that will be very democratic.

Let's take this to its logical conclusion. This means that the people of kiev (or within easy reach of kiev) get to decide who is president based on whichever political group is most willing to engage in violence.

That's not democratic at all. It's also not inherently an expression of popular will. We discover the expression of popular will via the ballot box.

&gt; ""22 February, Yanukovych fled the country"", ""Snap presidential elections held in Ukraine on 25 May 2014"" Does May come before February?

I'm referring to the vote in parliament to 'remove yanukovych', and the 'interim government'. I have no qualms with poroshenko.

&gt; I don't accept your premise that citizens should always follow the laws of the corrupt government, that they always should accept the system of government to have a ""functioning democracy"".

Well see this is where i think you're missing a point.

If instead of agitating for blood people had allowed the necessary legal processes to play out, then all that has happened since may have gone completely differently. By demanding change and going from one corrupt and divisive leader to another corrupt and divisive leader.... it can very easily be spun as a nationalist coup. It's a bad look imo.

A government that nobody voted for seizes power unconstitutionally. On their first day they vote to remove russian as an official language etc. That's the complete opposite of a 'government of national unity to ease tensions and bring everyone together'. Whether the majority of the people supported it or not, the way it was done was OBVIOUSLY going to lead to a backlash in the other direction. In essence it was a revolution led by one section of society against the other, not just 'against a few corrupt elites'. Tangentially related, but 'tyranny of the majority' is also a thing; i know that if we just did what the majority of people wanted on various issue in the uk then we'd have so horrendous outcomes.

I see the point that you shouldn't ignore a powerful states concerns just because of ideology. However I don't think Russian safety concerns are the main reason for the aggression towards Ukraine. For me it is just like an excuse to invade Ukraine and claim as much land as possible. 

Thats why Russia annexed Crimea. Russians where always angry because Ukraine got Crimea after its independence. If Ukraine joined NATO or even just the European Union they would not only loose influence in Ukraine but it would be nearly impossible for them to ever take back Crimea. By taking it they secured it and prevented Ukraine from entering any alliances.

Now Finnland joins NATO. While Russia threatens Finnland we can almost be certain it would never invade for security. Because they have no interest in Finnland despite having a 1340km Border that is very close to Saint Petersburg. NATO expansion is not the great concern for Russia. Culture is. This Russian expansion is fueled by its imperialist mindset not by rational thinking.

&gt;But they've sent conscripts into active combat since day 1, right? So are the legal obstacles Kofman notes actual obstacles or could they just... you know.

I think it's a big deal, hence Russian tap dancing on the issue. If it didn't matter they'd not even need to address it publicly.

Legally, conscripts aren't supposed to deploy and doctrinally they're not supposed to be used as combat troops. And on his Feb 24 speech Putin had announced that conscripts wouldn't be used in Ukraine. 

But then on Mar 9 the MOD brass said a mistake had been made that some units included conscripts with them in Ukraine. They even admitted some had been captured. However, they also claimed the conscripts would no longer be used in Ukraine and were being removed. 

Putin's spokesman doubled down during this time period, since the MOD announcement was in stark contradiction to his previous announcement, and said  that those commanders guilty of violating his orders and using their conscripts in Ukraine in combat against his orders would be punished. So he effectively dodged the blame, but still reiterated that the policy is they not be used

Then when the spring draft of conscripts was announced in late Mar and early Apr, Putin specifically said they'd not serve in Ukraine.

These three reactions and media shitstorms point that it was big enough of a deal that they couldn't admit they used them or accept personal fault. And it points that the policy hasn't changed, they're not supposed to be used in Ukraine.

So maybe conscripts are still used clandestinely but that could be a very dangerous political decision as Putin's public credibility among the Russians is on the line. While he's a dictator, he's not all powerful. There are certain things he can regularly lie about and certain things he can't, especially when he makes public pledges about them. Hence why he had to toss some generals under the bus to use as scapegoats for a manning decision he was almost surely involved in.

Here is a personal observation. What we do know is that Russian combat maneuver units are being reported at very poor manning levels, with a lot of BTGs also reported as having been removed from Ukraine altogether to stage in Belgorod. It was presumed that decision was solely because of heavy casualties but it's possible it was a mix of casualties plus losing their conscripts too. 

For all we know, Putin might even be telling the troops. Perhaps he gave a ""get it done"" order to increase the number of BTGs available to fight in Ukraine but meant them to use existing quasi legal means like pressuring conscripts to sign contracts (which isn't even that unethical if they're actually incentivizing them), using funds to basically bribe them veterans to reenlist, etc. And desperate commanders said fuck it, I'm using conscripts because if I don't my units won't be combat effective, needing them for combat support and service support jobs and maybe even having put many into combat arms positions. Then after things went bad, the invasion lasted more than a week, their decision blew up in their face and they got caught.

Likely, we're going to have to wait until the end of the war likely to know what really happened or the internal decisions for manning.",9e3e0cefed6e102fd9abb1c3eae55f9c4bd58a2d,True,False,,,,,0,1652394058,,0,{},i8dl57c,False,t3_unzexc,False,True,t1_i8d619r,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/unzexc/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_12_2022/i8dl57c/,1652394074,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652365258.0

SIG say it’s c.3.8kg with a magazine, but I suspect that’s a magazine and no cartridges and/or doesn’t include the suppressor (definitely won’t include the heavy new optic). 

At a guess, with bullets in the gun and everything hanging off it, it’s going to be a c.5.5kg rifle, which is about a whole kilo/2lb more than kitted/out M4s.

I really question the impact weight like that will have on fatigue and off-hand accuracy (I.e. most of the shots an infantryman will take) after a while of running about, leaping up &amp; down, etc.

As an aside, I feel the same way about the wide scale Marine adoption of the HK416 with variable power optic and suppressor which probably ends up about the same weight. That doesn’t even have the excuse of the 6.8 cartridge or the fire control system.

* delaying mobilization until Ukrainians siege Sevastopol, then wait 3-6 month minimum to get them sent to the frontlines, at that point it would be completely pointless anyway

[],False,,TheHuscarl,,,[],,,,text,t2_amv0e,False,False,"I think this is a good analysis of why nuclear fears may have lessened over time but I have a couple of issues I believe are worth noting. Also, to preface, I am super duper nuclear paranoid, so I am wholeheartedly in the avoid nuclear war camp.   


First, the author seems to have a sort of implicit lean towards inaction. I'm not going to say he's Russia-biased, but he really seems to tacitly condemn NATO actions while basically parroting Russia's nuclear threats as if they're somehow justified. The onus, for example, seems to be placed entirely on NATO: ""The odds that he may are steadily increasing as Nato countries inch toward direct conflict with Russia."" I'm curious what Professor Immerwahr thinks the appropriate response to irresponsible nuclear blackmail is. Should we simply allow any country with nuclear weapons to rattle the saber and take what they like? Because that almost seems to be his implication here: ""Already, Russia has threatened nuclear war multiple times, and yet Nato countries increase their aid to Ukraine. The “current generation of Nato politicians”, Russia’s exasperated ambassador in Washington has complained, “does not take the nuclear threat seriously.”"" Guess we should just stop supporting Ukraine then? What happens when Putin rolls on to NATO? I'm not a big fan of the rhetoric surrounding the idea that we have to stand up to Putin forcefully or he'll do it again etc etc, but I'm also not going to ever argue that free, independent states should just capitulate to the whims of any nuclear-armed dictator.  


Second, I believe that the general idea that people are not afraid of nuclear war is overblown. If people were generally not caring about nukes, fears of nuclear war would not have skyrocketed since this conflict started. Iodine pill sales would not have been through the roof. If anything, this conflict has been the event that Professor Immerwahr was looking for. It has thoroughly jogged the mind of every person born after the nuclear threat that nuclear war is a possibility. People are concerned about it now more than they have been since the end of the Cold War, even more than when the DPRK was far more likely to use a nuclear weapon back in 2018. That was a crisis that a lot of the general public seemed woefully ignorant of. Now, people seem much more clued in to the threat of nuclear war. See the massive spike in the use of NukeMap, for example, as another indicator that people are really thinking about this for the first time. I went through higher education where nuclear use and its risks where discussed in depth, so I have long harbored nuclear fears, but I know among my peer group (roughly 25-35) this is the first time they have really grappled with the open fear of nuclear war. Heck, even the fact that Trump's ridiculous theorycrafting about nuking hurricanes was met with nothing but stunned silence and public ridicule and criticism shows that people aren't joking around with nukes.  


Third, I'm not sure that the implicit assumption that political leaders, especially Western political leaders, are not taking this seriously holds water. Nothing from the United States has signaled that we are not taking the nuclear threats seriously. Just because we are not immediately rolling over to them does not mean the government is cavalier about this. If we weren't taking the threat of escalation seriously, why would we cancel our missile test with the specific justification that we didn't want it interpreted as a threat? Why would we have worked so hard to reestablish the deconfliction line? Why would we have resisted the call to send Ukraine fighter planes for fear of an escalatory move? Why would we have held back on sanctioning Putin's mistress/psuedo-wife? Let's not forget that most of the players involved here grew around the height of Cold War nuclear scares or are products of the Cold War themselves. In short, they were trained and raised by the very people who the professor cites as being so afraid of nuclear war. Both Biden and Putin are Cold War veterans, it is undoubtedly well-ingrained in both of them that nuclear wars are the ultimate evil and a potential end to humanity. The military leaders are of the same generation and were doubtless taught the same lessons. Defense Secretary Austin, for example, started his career as a second lieutenant with an armored division in West Germany during the 70s, I believe, where all service members undoubtedly lived under the constant cloud of either conventional or nuclear destruction in the event of a hot war with the Soviets. Gerasimov joined the Soviet military at around the same time when the same thinking was prevalent on their side of the line. Younger leaders, such as Johnson, may be more cavalier, but it's clearly not universal. For example, Macron, who leads a nuclear power, has been strenuous in trying to keep options for peace open.   


Fourth, none of this argumentation can really deny the basic fact that nuclear use is irrational. Lack of fear may lead to more irresponsible behavior, which indeed increases risks, but it does not lead to irrationality. ""People can't imagine the consequences of nuclear war therefore they'll break one of the most intensive taboos in international relations and bring about the annihilation of humanity"" is a sort of silly argument. Governments know what a nuclear war costs. World leaders know what a nuclear war costs. There are reports and analyses, advice and writings, all dedicated to this. No matter what the author thinks about the need for imagination, even the most unimaginative person, looking at the estimates and data provided, can see that a nuclear war would be an apocalypse. Now some members of the general public may be less likely to understand that, a position that comes from ignorance, but it seems inconceivable that the leaders of governments, even the ignorant ones, will somehow avoid seeing these data and estimates as the chance of nuclear war increases.  


Anyway, I think the gist of this is correct. For too long we have been coddled as a world by the idea that nuclear war is an impossibility. We must not lose sight that it is possible. But we also cannot succumb to nuclear blackmail. We also cannot assume that just because the uninformed general public is more ignorant to the consequences of nuclear war, the informed government is as well.",e59b78c60134b5f681f09dc18ffb113a61603d9a,True,False,,,,,0,1652384035,,0,{},i8cwdg8,False,t3_uo6jvf,False,True,t3_uo6jvf,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uo6jvf/forgetting_the_apocalypse_why_our_nuclear_fears/i8cwdg8/,1652384053,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652355235.0

[],False,,Tidorith,,,[],,,,text,t2_9d5fh,False,False,"&gt;To be fair, American allies in Afghanistan collapsed immediately

People keep drawing this analogy, but it's the opposite situation. In Afghanistan, the US were the invaders, and the government they'd put in place was easily tossed out because it never had meaningful local support - in a military, actual state-control sense. The plurality of locals in Afghanistan who were willing to take up arms held their own in a war against the US for 20 years (despite initial near-total defeat), and outlasted them. And that's despite not having high unity within their own country - there *was* an army aligned to some degree with the US, it just wasn't anywhere near as good and/or committed as what the Taliban could field.

The analogy to be drawn is between the Taliban and Ukraine. It's not a matter of ideology or how much we like them, but the reality that they are or represent (through whatever government system) a native population being invaded by a foreign adversary. Ukraine is slightly larger population wise, far more modern, has massive external backing, and is being attacked by a smaller and less competent foe (compared to the Afghanistan invasion by the US) - albeit one who has a huge advantage in proximity compare to the US invading Afghanistan. 

The significant hinge point in this comparison is unity. Ukraine was very disunited pre-2014, didn't appear particularly united pre-2022 (although much more so outside of Crimea and occupied Donbas than pre-2014) - but after the 2022 invasion unity is close to maximal, only excluding a few remaining collaborators. This should have been somewhat predictable given the 8 years of war and the fact that most Russia supports were already on the other side of the line, and whose support for Russia was probably contingent to begin with on the understanding that it wasn't Russia attacking/invading/annexing eastern Ukraine, but like-minded Russophiles from Ukraine itself. The invasion shattered that narrative, regardless of how much truth there actually was in it. War - at least, the more traditional kind of war we're seeing now - has a way of doing that.",07069eb2fe66c8c86662579cd2ccb71f8ce60e35,True,False,,,,,0,1652383289,,0,{},i8cueks,False,t3_umwmzj,False,True,t1_i87qc13,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/umwmzj/did_russias_general_staff_miss_warnings_of_a_hard/i8cueks/,1652383302,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652354489.0

democracy translates to ""rule of the people"". Not rule of the party, or any one man. People write laws, including constitution. People rewrite them. That's the baseline of where you should start. 

People on Maidan were not mob, they had legitimate grievances with their government. Government addressed those grievances by beating up and shooting people. At that point the Government stopped being legitimate, and people redressed their grievances with the means they had available.

&gt;you kinda need to follow the law

Who does? Just the people? Or should the president, and his cronies follow it too? The whole ""It's OK for presidents to do bad things, just not the people"" is lost on me. It's such an anti-democratic way of thinking.

&gt;They're all corrupt.

So you insist that people follow the law, just not the presidents, because they never do? 

People can hold 20000 Maidans for each subsequent corrupt president if they want until they find one they like, and that will be very democratic.

&gt;They voted before he'd fled the country

""22 February, Yanukovych fled the country"", ""Snap presidential elections held in Ukraine on 25 May 2014"" Does May come before February? 

&gt;The argument that 'it was ok because the next time it was done legitimately' is a bit of a strange one though i must say.

My argument is that it was democratic. The will of the people. I'm not saying whether it was legal or orderly. What I'm saying is that will of the people trumps both of those things, and rightfully so.

I don't accept your premise that citizens should always follow the laws of the corrupt government, that they ever should accept the system of government to have a ""functioning democracy"". 

There are legitimate cases where even democratically elected government stop being legitimate, and that's all built into the theory of how democratic societies operate.",5800dc3125d5ef3ae46f259fb6786321c72d3677,True,False,,,,,0,1652378199,,0,{},i8chmag,False,t3_unzexc,False,True,t1_i8c9v24,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/unzexc/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_12_2022/i8chmag/,1652378217,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652349399.0

The part about Khrushchev speaking to Kennedy based on the mutual experience of having seen war up close is something that sticks out to me. Such a basic and human thing to have seen and felt emotionally the suffering of others, to remember that deep psychological impact on yourself, and to use that to transcend ideological barriers to maintain peace. 

The author make a great analogy of the lack of fear of disease, and irrational fear of vaccines, being due to the lack of a living memory of seeing consequences up close. This drove his point home for me.

&gt;Daniel Immerwahr is an associate professor of history at Northwestern University, and the author of How to Hide an Empire: A Short History of the Greater United States (Bodley Head, 2019)

-----------------

&gt; * It was “insane”, US president John F Kennedy felt, that “two men, sitting on the opposite sides of the world, should be able to decide to bring an end to civilisation”. Yet everyone knowingly lived with that insanity for decades. It was as if, wrote the historian Paul Boyer, “the Bomb” were “one of those categories of Being, like Space and Time, that, according to Kant, are built into of the very structure of our minds, giving shape and meaning to all our perceptions”.

&gt; * The bomb no longer gives “shape and meaning to all our perceptions”; until recently, many thought of it only rarely. It has been tempting to see nuclear war as a bygone terror that no longer terrifies, like polio.

&gt; * Nine countries collectively hold some 10,000 warheads, and six of those countries are increasing their inventories. 

&gt; * We’ve seen in other contexts what happens when our experience of a risk attenuates. In rich countries, the waning memory of preventable diseases has fed the anti-vaccination movement. 

&gt; * That is the danger with nuclear war. Using declassified documents, historians now understand how close we came, multiple times, to seeing the missiles fired.

&gt; * What distinguished atomic weapons was how easy they made it, noted J Robert Oppenheimer, who had helped oversee the bomb’s development. Atomic weapons “profoundly upset the precarious balance” between offence and defence that had governed war hitherto, Oppenheimer explained. A single plane, a single payload – no city was safe.

&gt; * For many readers, this was the first time they registered that Hiroshima wasn’t a “Japanese army base”, as US president Harry Truman had described it when announcing the bombing, but a city of civilians – doctors, seamstresses, factory workers – who had watched loved ones die. Nor did they die cleanly, vaporised in the puff of a mushroom cloud. Hersey profiled a Methodist pastor, Kiyoshi Tanimoto, who raced to the aid of his ailing but very much still-living neighbours. As Tanimoto grasped one woman, “her skin slipped off in huge, glove-pieces”. Tanimoto “was so sickened by this that he had to sit down for a minute”, wrote Hersey. “He had to keep consciously repeating to himself, ‘These are human beings.’”

&gt; * For Albert Einstein, a world state was “the only one way out”: it was either that or annihilation. Yet the world state never came, and neither did another nuclear war. One of the most surprising and important facts of modern history is a quiet one: in the 76 years since Hiroshima and Nagasaki, not a single nuclear weapon has been detonated in anger.

&gt; * The very thing that terrified Oppenheimer about nuclear weapons – that they made attacking easy and defending nearly impossible – meant that any country nuking a similarly armed foe would have to expect a counterstrike.

&gt; * A widely publicised 1961 study of 61,000 baby teeth collected in St Louis showed that children born after the first hydrogen bombs were tested had markedly higher levels of the carcinogen strontium-90, a byproduct of the tests, despite being some 1,500km away from the closest test site.

&gt; * By contrast, the nuclear apparatus, once in place, could be set into motion by a handful of men in only a few minutes. This also meant, the world soon realised, that another Hiroshima could come by accident.

&gt; * “The whole idea is to kill the bastards,” said US general Thomas Power, when presented in 1960 with a nuclear plan designed to minimise casualties. “Look. At the end of the war, if there are two Americans and one Russian, we win.” This is the man who led the US Strategic Air Command – responsible for its nuclear bombs and missiles – during the Cuban missile crisis.

&gt; * But after a series of escalating threats, Kennedy’s Soviet counterpart Khrushchev changed the tone with a frantic, personal appeal. “I have participated in two wars and know that war ends when it has rolled through cities and villages, everywhere sowing death and destruction,” he wrote. Kennedy, as a fellow “military man” who had also seen combat (Khrushchev mentioned this twice), would “understand perfectly what terrible forces” could be unleashed.

&gt; * We should feel relief, but the dispelling of dread has made it hard for many to take nuclear war seriously. “I hear people talk about nuclear weapons,” arms control expert Jeffrey Lewis told me recently, “and it’s just so divorced from reality.” They’ve become “dead metaphors”, Lewis feels, lacking the concreteness to disturb our thoughts or constrain our behaviours.

&gt; * But we can’t drive nuclear war to extinction by ignoring it. Instead, we must dismantle arsenals, strengthen treaties and reinforce antinuclear norms. Right now, we’re doing the opposite. And we’re doing it just at the time when those who have most effectively testified to nuclear war’s horrors – the survivors – are entering their 90s. Our nuclear consciousness is badly atrophied. We’re left with a world full of nuclear weapons but emptying of people who understand their consequences.",083df8cdfa2bc763324c3130a83bfc89f94429a7,True,False,,,,,0,1652377864,,0,{},i8cgrwk,True,t3_uo6jvf,False,True,t3_uo6jvf,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uo6jvf/forgetting_the_apocalypse_why_our_nuclear_fears/i8cgrwk/,1652377875,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652349064.0

[],False,,chowieuk,,,[],,,,text,t2_b230l,False,False,"&gt; In political sense, you couldn't get any more legitimate than post-Maidan government. That is, if you respect democracy.

I'm sorry, but in actual democracies you don't get to hold votes under imminent threat of violence by armed protestors standing outside. you don't get to breach the constitution in order to install a new government whilst the MPs from the leading party are fleeing the capital for their own safety. those are the exact opposite of 'democratic'. Pandering to the mob isn't 'democracy'.

It would be like if on Jan 6th all the democrats fled for their safety, the remaining republicans voted for trump and then just unconstitutionally declared him to be the new president. Unfortunately it doesn't matter how valid you believe the cause to be, you kinda need to follow the law. 

Yanukovych was defeated. There was absolutely no need to renege on the agreement everyone had just signed beyond pandering to the mob. All they had to do was implement the government of national unity and ease tensions and then either impeach yanukovych legally or wait until a new president was elected and then continue the age-old ukrainian tradition of having your opponent arrested. Strikes me that those in charge had little interest in 'easing tensions' though.

&gt; Step 1: The corrupt president fled to Russia after murdering his own people. He decided not to stick around to face justice.

1. They're all corrupt. The implication that they're not is silly.

2. You appear to have gotten the timeline significantly mixed up. They voted before he'd fled the country

3. mob justice is not justice. There was no protection in kiev as all that state security apparatus had disappeared. Don't pretend you'd do any different.

&gt; Step 2: They appointed a guy in the meantime, who stepped down after elections

Sure. An illegitimate, unconstitutional government that was immediately recognised across the west. The act of recognition in itself is almost akin to the west actively supporting a coup in public. It's shameless in retrospect.

&gt; Step 3: They held free and fair elections. And we know that because that guy also stepped down after Zelensky was elected.

Yes. a legitimate government. Back to usual. The argument that 'it was ok because the next time it was done legitimately' is a bit of a strange one though i must say.

&gt; Is there a specified procedure for Maidan? I'm guessing not, but democratically speaking there was absolutely nothing wrong with it.

Insurrections aren't legit just because you happen to support them.

&gt; Because they were told by Russian propaganda that it's illegitimate. 

I'm genuinely struggling to see in what factual way you could argue it wasn't? I would in fact argue that you have been subject to propaganda in the opposite direction.

You're also now arguing that the democratic views of the population are somehow illegitimate in themselves. The other problem with democracy is that many of your fellow countrymen may hold silly or incorrect views. Unfortunately those views are just as valid electorally as yours.

&gt;  And ""large"" is an overstatement. You can say Crimea, and maybe Luhansk and Donetsk, but again; not all, and only because of TV.

Nobody said all, but the key to a functioning democracy is that people accept the system of governance.

And again, your assumptions about how *China* sees the calculus in such a scenario are creating a massive blind spot in how you see this playing out.

Look at how quickly Putin when to brinksmanship.  And how even with sanctions and negative popular opinion towards Russia in the west, many sanctioning countries are still quietly buying Russian commodities, because at the end of the day, Russia has massive commodities leverage over Europe and much of the world.

China's economic ties are far deeper, as they aren't just in commodities but are further downstream in the value chain of most manufactured goods consumed by the West.  Even getting to the point of lobbing missiles at China's coast will lead to severe Chinese reaction.  We are seeing in real time how Westerners largely don't want any smoke relating to decline in living standards.  Authoritarian regimes have the advantage of not having to be responsive to elections in the short term, so their societies for better or worse are able to absorb pain for far longer than in the west.

In political sense, you couldn't get any more legitimate than post-Maidan government. That is, if you respect democracy. 

Step 1: The corrupt president fled to Russia after murdering its own people. He decided not to stick around to face justice.

Step 2: They appointed a guy in the meantime, who stepped down after elections

Step 3: They held free and fair elections. And we know that because that guy also stepped down after Zelensky was elected. 

Is there a specified procedure for Maidan? I'm guessing not, but democratically speaking there was absolutely nothing wrong with it.

Because they were told by Russian propaganda that it's illegitimate. And ""large"" is an overstatement. You can say Crimea, and maybe Luhansk and Donetsk, but again; not all, and only because of TV.

Its appointment was entirely unconstitutional and vast swathes of ukraine considered it illegitimate. However the collective west recognised it the next day whilst calling the democratically elected government of yanukovych somehow illegitimate.

Compare it to the taliban, which has full control of the country and seemingly no real opposition. They're about as legitimate as it gets in a real world sense (albeit not the kid of government we'd consider desirable), and yet nobody at all recognises them. Does that mean that whilst being a recognised country afghanistan has no government? 

That is all to say, i'm not really sure how relevant legitimacy is.

I'm thinking of this as less of a ""phyrric victory"" situation ... and more an ""irredentist claim to territory that is only partialy satisfied by the first war"" situation.

I don't think the claimants are very often satisfied by that kind of partial win. Or at least satisfied for very long.

I think I'd also want to argue that is a true Phyrric victory either, if we were in the scenario where Russia won Crimea/Donbas at even double the current casualties.

In modern war standards thats a huge number of casualties.... in terms of 19th/20thC standards it might well be considered ""A rather successful war with relatively low casualties for those large gains in territory"".

The Franco-Prussian war ended with a similaar ceding of territory peace as we're proposing here.

Prussia lost 150k men to take Alsace and Lorraine in the Franco Prussian war. 30km^2 for the price of a fair chunk of total Prussian Empire pop of 41m.

If Russia loses 40-50k men fromtheir 140m pop, and takes Crimea and Donbas....an area 3x as big.... its unclear by what standard thats a Phyrric victory.

Yes, plenty of countries have done so. History is replete with examples of countries that have repeatedly fought the same neighbour again and again even if the previous campaign only granted them a phyrric victory of high casualties and not much territory. 

Phyrrus came back and fought Rome again 5 years after his ""Phyrric Victory"" at Asculum!

I am not sure Putin cares all that much about casualties, so long asw he gets to portray his military adventure as a win for the neo-russian empire. 

If he gets to go back and crow about how this war won russia even more territory, and made it even more great and showcased how true russian nationalism cannot be defeated, and how they acheived their aims of annexing Crimea and the Donbas at the start of the war.... then the next time he wants to boost his image, or extend the neo-russian empire further, he'll come back for more.

If he keeps ""winning"" he can keep that bandwagon rolling. He needs a loss to stop it.

With the rest of his border either already Satellite states or NATO.... where is he going to be able to extend his Imperial ambitions next time he wasnts to flex for his own reasons ? 

Seemnsd to me he'd likely regard his mission of ""protecting Russians living under the yoke of Ukrainian Nazis"" to be incomplete.

2. From what we know publicly, the security guarantee wasn't the major hurdle, rather it was the only thing (outside of humanitarian concerns) that Ukraine was even open to discussing. So it's not that if we suddenly solved the security guarantee question there would be peace tomorrow. And as for the question itself it's not clear what the solution would be...

No. They don't have to be perfect. In this scenario *what they had today was enouigh*.

They need to be better. They are capable of doing that... plugging the most egregious holes (drones, secure comms).... seeing to their most obvious training needs (combined arms and large scale air operrations). 

They don't need to totally reform to be a NATO pattern force. If they can win with this army, then they can win again in the future with this army ""with its worst failing dealt with"".

&gt;A ""few BTG's of Little Green Men"" worked in 2014. What makes you think it will work again in 2030 after what you're seeing now in 2022?

Maybe it wouldn't, maybe it would. But even if it doesn't..... they can use the army they've got now, unimporved, and expect to win *if that army won the same limited war against the same foe last time*.

&gt;Oh please, we are approaching the three month mark of Putin's misbegotten illegal war of aggression against Ukraine, and so far

But this was a scenario in which 

a) They'd got the whole of Donbas and agreed a peace in which they kept it, which neccessarily means...

b) They'd beaten Ukraine sufficiently well *according to the Ukraniansd own estimation of their losses* that they had no chance to take the Donbas back and so were *willing to agree giving it up to sue for peace*

In this scenario, despite the russian army being a shower of shit, they had enough of an overwhelming advantage in numbers and willingness to throw bodies onto the pile....that they ""won"" the Donbas and secured that as independent/russian territory.

For all the other failues you can point to, and there are many of them, it was an army in this scenario that ""had enough force to capture 2 oblasts, and force the ukranians to let them keep them"".

If they can do it once.... they can do it again (with enough of a pause to refit/reconstitute). If they manage to get *even better than they were before* in that time period, gravy. Maybe they can take 4 Oblasts next time, or the whole Shebang.

They don't need to reform to become ""A shitty NATO clone"" to do that again. Clearly what they have is probably not enough to defeat a big coalition, or attack europe, nbut is enough to keep slicing a few chunks of a Ukraine that gets weaker every time the last raid that caved off a couple of chunks was successful.

Although there are lots of things the Russians *should do* that may take decades to happen, or be impossible under their current regime......... there are *also* lots of smaller things they can do, in under a decade, that would greatly improve their performance, even if they won't be as transformational. 

Shit, justhaving proper secure comms, plenty of drones, training their pilots on large scale air war, and training their BTGs properly on combined arms warfare, training their artillery better at counter-battery fire and drone assisted targetting would be enough to see a *substantial improvement* over their performance this time.... even if bigger reforms that would give them even bigger performance boosts than that like  creating an NCO core, or allowing C&amp;C to devolve to lower levels of comnmand, are never attempted.",9cb98750a41f73737a6c6757dc09aebb23c01e3a,True,False,,,,,0,1652362721,,0,{},i8benuu,False,t3_unzexc,False,True,t1_i8bcjpf,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/unzexc/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_12_2022/i8benuu/,1652362734,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652333921.0

Anyway, all newly occupied territories are within 100km of active warzone, so there's only so much they can do.

&gt; One main major hurdle during the earlier peace talks was there's lack of safety guarantees for Ukraine, which they (understandably) believes that without it any peace will only be temporary regardless of the outcome of such talks. Do we have any progress on this front?

Sadly no. As a result Ukraine pretty much needs to win completely. Leaving Russia in control of any Ukraine territory + no guarantees = very high risk of Russia starting another war in a few years. That's not something Ukraine can accept.

The only way Ukraine could agree to anything less than full liberation is if it got NATO membership or roughly NATO equivalent guarantees (like Japan or South Korea have).

&gt; I strongly believes that regardless of the outcome of this war, as long as Ukraine remains a sovereign country, they will be nuclearly armed within a decade

This is really expensive, weapons, delivery systems etc., and Ukraine will be spending the next decade rebuilding.

However, defeating Russia is the only way to preserve nuclear non-proliferation system. Any Russian victory would mean obtaining nuclear weapons is now top priority of every mid-tier country. NATO stupidly ignored this risk early on, and only got fortunate thanks to just how bad Russians were.

Kissinger learned of this threatening nuclear escalation on the morning of 9 October. On that same day, Meir issued a personal appeal for military assistance, which European nations declined. Nixon, however, ordered the commencement of Operation Nickel Grass, to replace all of Israel's materiel losses. Author Seymour Hersh claimed in 1991 that there was ""anecdotal evidence"" that Kissinger had told Anwar Sadat that the reason for the U.S. airlift was that the Israelis were close to ""going nuclear."" In subsequent interviews, however, Kissinger, James Schlesinger and William Quandt, stated that the ongoing Soviet re-supply effort and Sadat's early rejection of a ceasefire were the primary motivators, not fears of Israel use of nuclear weapons.

HDFS and S3 have the same abstract interface, because their resources are located by URIs? Fucking lol. Maybe you can replace them with a local file system, because it also follows file:// uri scheme?

&gt; A queue is a FIFO data structure. Whenever you put a queue in a system design they all do the same thing.    

They do not, because for instance Kafka is much more than that. It has a transcation log with history of all operations and supports partitions which makes it not a FIFO outside of a single partition. 

&gt; You have your core logic which should never depend on the underlying queue and a layer that interacts with the actual queue.

Of course containers and Kubernetes are ubiquitous, we also use them in basically every project. But so are cloud services.

I'd contend that there's more to it. It strikes me that humans have a somewhat illogical attachment to territory and value it far beyond the lives of the people living within it. Just look at Crimea - I'm not sure that polling has *ever* not had a large majority of crimeans supporting reunification from russia or secession from ukraine. *Western* polling both before and after the annexation showed support of ~70% iirc.

Yet pretty much everybody demands crimea be 'returned' to ukraine, a country where secession is illegal (Crimea has tried in the past). There is absolutely nothing rational about this. Just cut your losses ffs. The argument that 'well the referendum wasn't credible' doesn't have a whole lot of validity when you yourself would refuse to recognise it even if it did.

Alas nationalism is a hell of a drug and territory is a core part of nationalism, even if that territory shares nothing in common with your nation. If there's one thing you can predict with any confidence, it's the brutal repression of secessionist/ seperatist movements, even in the 'liberal democratic west'.

This makes units more prone to casualties; Artillery pieces/tanks lacking infantry support, having to do with decreasing amounts of fuel/munitions, that sort of thing. This feedback loop, if maintained to its conclusion, is a collapse. 

This loop is broken if Russia retreats and Ukraine is unable to pursue. As much as people don't like hearing it, Ukraine doesn't really have the capability to operate in-depth, and is not able to capitalize on such a collapse, and Russia has shown itself to be willing to withdraw from unmaintainable positions. The Russian army near Kiev was not encircled and destroyed en masse. As such, I find actual collapse of the entire Russian force operating in Ukraine not believable.

[That shopping center in Kyiv was bombed aerially](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-kyiv-shopping-centre-it-hit-was-storing-ukrainian-rockets-2022-03-21/) but the main structure still stood, and the collapsed rubble nearby is still a major obstacle obstructing line-of-sight and movement, and still has enough holes so that people can still crawl inside it and shoot from it.

Indeed such observation has been made before. Let me quote [John Spencer](https://mwi.usma.edu/city-not-neutral-urban-warfare-hard/) here:

&gt;Also, unlike other environments, military force applied to urban terrain  
 historically increases the difficulty of conducting operations in it.   
The preparatory and assaulting fires from airstrikes, artillery, and   
mortars creates rubble that in turn makes the terrain easier to defend   
and harder to attack. The rubble blocks vehicle movements and, in many   
cases, creates even stronger fortifications than the buildings provided   
while standing. The commanding officer of the US mission in support of   
the Iraqi Army during the final battle to liberate Mosul in 2017, Gen.   
Stephen Townsend, described it by saying,  
 “The buildings had been turned into bunkers. Imagine a five-story   
building and the top four floors are gone. They’re rubble now and that   
rubble is twenty and thirty feet deep on top of the first floor and the   
basement floor. . . . You couldn’t build a better bomb-proof shelter   
than that. If you tried to erect it, it would be easier to penetrate   
that with our munitions than the accidental bunkers created by rubble.”

Most buildings in Taiwan (and in other large cities in Asia-Pacific) are designed with floods, hurricanes, and earthquakes in mind. These buildings can withstand a lot of punishment.

\*\*\*

To be fair, an operation that tries to level a city doesn't really intend to mimic the effect of a 150-kiloton nuke by using 150 kilotons of explosive. The gist is to stop the effective functioning of a city, disrupt the logistics, and ultimately force the depopulation of the city by starving it.

However, we must remember that we are now talking about a near-peer conflict. Is leveling the city enough to disrupt the military-grade logistics of a near-peer army?

60's should be pushed down to the platoon level if we're going to be operating in smaller, lighter, more mobile units as part of distributed ops. 

The m1a1 may have been obsolete for the USMC, but that doesn't mean they couldn't still make use of an MPF. Maybe an IFV with a 50mm cannon, .338 coax and roof mount, Javelin, stingers, a mine plow on the front, and room in the back for either a miclic or a 81mm mortar team could work. The Textron Cottonmouth and ACV seem so underpowered to help out the infantry, especially in urban areas. Maybe a sort of tank battalion would be too much, but we could retain a company of these (or other)light tanks as part of combat assault battalions. I just don't think we should give up our ability to punch a hole in the enemy's lines. Maybe one combat assault battalion in each marine division would suffice. 

The M777 range extensions are great, but the gun is still heavy and it's getting even longer. It requires a 7ton to move around which is slow, heavy, takes up a lot of space on ship, and has a large thermal signature. If it's carried by helicopter, the m777 reduces its operational range much more than a light howitzer would. It's slow to get on and off ship, it takes up a lot of space on ship, it cannot be fired from most ship decks, and it is slow to displace in the event of russian or Chinese counter battery fire. While the m119a3 may not shoot as far as the m777, I think it's smaller size, quicker displacement time, decreased strain on helos, and smaller prime movers would be better in the end than the m777. Maybe they can extend the tube of the m119 a bit, then make it so it's able to fire precision guided rocket assisted shells?

Well, they quite literally did cross the river:

https://twitter.com/UAWeapons/status/1524413089579511808

However, that crossing at Bilohorivka after overwhelming testimony and photographic evidence is considered a failure for now.

It's likely that they'll attempt/have already attempted additional crossings with more pontoons, however I'm not sure where those pontoons are placed

If we look at what he's saying:

""11/05, 18:00 ""The enemy is trying to hold positions on the right bank of the river Seversky Donets""

12/05 6:00 ""In the Lyman direction, the enemy forced the river Seversky Donets to enter the main forces and conduct the offensive""

GS (general staff) changed the estimate by 180 overnight""

The Genstaff thing in particular:

""In the Lyman direction, the enemy crossed the Seversky Donets River to enter the main forces and conduct an offensive. In the direction of Siversk leads the offensive in the direction of the Green Valley and Novoselivka. Fighting continues.""

To be honest I'm not completely sure, but I'm pretty sure this is talking about a crossing in a different area, since both Lyman and Novoselivka (at least the one I assume we're talking about) are in a completely different salient from Severdonetsk (but admittedly I'm confused as to what river is being discussed)

So while I'm still confused, I'm pretty sure what's being discussed is separate from the Bilohorivka event.",08450ac55d396d7f40f518e4cd6e34ff61672317,True,False,,,,,0,1652332941,,0,{},i8a7swm,False,t3_un86mu,False,True,t1_i8a3y06,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/un86mu/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_11_2022/i8a7swm/,1652332956,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652304141.0

The section on the 1979 war with Vietnam was brutal:


&gt; * China’s invasion of Vietnam in 1979 and the border skirmishes during the decade thereafter are generally considered to be the PLA’s most recent experience of warfare. While the battles were fought primar- ily within Vietnam’s jungles, urban warfare was also an important component of the conflict. During the invasion, the PLA conquered 17 district towns and the capital cities of three provinces.76 The pro- vincial capital of Lang Son lay on a route used by past Chinese empires invading Vietnam and was the PLA’s primary target.77 In the assault on Lang Son, the PLA first captured the three mountains and a key hill surrounding it—the city’s primary defensive ele- ments—before beginning an assault on the city itself.78 

&gt; * Unlike in many of its assaults on cities during the Chinese Civil War, the PLA did not prioritize limiting civilian casualties or destruction of infrastructure in Lang Son. The assault on Lang Son started with a large-scale artillery barrage; in the words of the PLA commander, the inten- tion was to “raze every house in Lang Son.”79 After entering the city, PLA troops initially cap- tured government buildings and nearby heights, which allowed or improved intelligence in support of artillery strikes.80 The Vietnamese forces operating from close defensive works, such as the city’s caves, were eliminated with gasoline, flamethrowers, and explosives.81 

&gt; * When the PLA later withdrew from Lang Son, its 55th Army destroyed thousands of military and public facilities, reportedly reducing much of the city to ruins.82 The PLA looted what was not destroyed and reportedly repeated this same pattern of deliberate damage and looting against other urban areas it assaulted in Vietnam.83 The overall impact of this destruction was reported to have badly impacted Vietnam’s economy for the next 15 years.84 The PLA later called this destruc- tion a “goodbye kiss” for the country.85 China’s goal had been to “teach Vietnam a lesson,” and any concern for collateral damage or damage limitation was quickly abandoned.86 

&gt; * The PLA tends to remember its invasion of Vietnam as relatively successful because the outcome was consistent with its political objective: to impose punishment.87 By contrast, the accounts of foreign analysts typically concentrate on the PLA’s diffi- culty in conducting the operation, even so close to China’s borders, as well as the PLA’s high number of casualties.88 The difficulties inherent to urban warfare, including distinguishing combatants from civilians, appeared to produce frustration among PLA forces, which manifested in reports of the PLA shooting prisoners and reportedly killing civilians.89 The PLA’s punitive approach was intended to devas- tate important urban areas.90 Such conduct, as well as accounts of violence targeting noncombatants,",5ffa3889b58807fc6f8a066be8507fffd0a3b5ee,True,False,,,,,0,1652331701,,0,{},i8a5wnz,False,t3_unsuhc,False,True,t3_unsuhc,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/unsuhc/the_plas_evolving_outlook_on_urban_warfare/i8a5wnz/,1652331712,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652302901.0

Summary:

* The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has been increasing its study, training, and preparation for future urban warfare over the past decade. The PLA has limited experience with urban warfare and so often relies on observations of other militaries to inform its outlook. Among the drivers for this interest in urban warfare is that any Chinese campaign to force “(re)unification” with Taiwan could involve intense fighting in Taiwanese cities. The current edition of the Science of Military Strategy mentions an urban offensive (城市进攻) as a component of island operations (岛上作战) but does not elaborate on the conduct of such an offensive, likely because of the sensitivity of this scenario. This campaign could present a particular challenge, given that over 90 percent of Taiwan’s population lives in cities. Beyond the possibility of invading Taiwan, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is also concerned about terrorist threats, whether real and imagined, within China’s cities or against the security of Chinese citizens and businesses worldwide. Meanwhile, the conduct of urban counterterrorism has become the focus of several exercises and exchanges undertaken by the PLA and the People’s Armed Police (PAP).
* This report explores the PLA’s history with urban warfare and considers several lessons from the PLA’s study of other militaries’ operations. Our analysis examines the PLA’s outlook on new technologies and emerging capabilities for future urban warfare, discusses several relevant weapon systems and capabilities that the PLA is pursuing, and evaluates the training and recent exercises through which the PLA is seeking to improve its proficiency in urban warfare. This report concludes by raising questions for future research and includes several recommendations and considerations for US and Taiwanese policy responses. The US military can look to leverage lessons learned from its conflicts over the past twenty years and explore options to contribute to Taiwan’s capabilities for robust defense and resistance within its cities. The PLA’s progress in preparing for urban warfare will merit continued analytic attention; an improved understanding of these dynamics could inform US and Taiwanese initiatives to bolster deterrence.

* While often closely associated with the countryside, the founding and formative experiences of the Red Army, the predecessor to the PLA, actually occurred within the forge of major battles fought for and in China’s cities. The CCP’s victory over the KMT in the Chinese Civil War was enabled by its capacity to seize and hold key cities.
* The difficulties inherent to urban warfare, including distinguishing combatants from civilians, appeared to produce frustration among PLA forces, which manifested in reports of the PLA shooting prisoners and reportedly killing civilians. Such conduct [contributed] to an intense hatred toward
China that persisted for decades. The PLA has since highlighted the importance of avoiding collateral damage in its discourse on and training for urban
warfare, but discipline and adherence to norms of professional conduct can break down despite — or because of — political education and indoctrination.
* As the US military waged wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the PLA’s attention was often drawn to the successes of adversaries with lesser capabilities that nonetheless managed to impose severe casualties upon the US military, undercutting US morale in the process. 
* Urban warfare in the “network age” has increased complexity, and there is greater difficulty in distinguishing adversary signals and communications
when civilian networks can be used to disseminate information, which exacerbates the challenge in “whether operational intelligence can be mined
accurately in the information fog,” according to one commentary. Greater precision in warfare also requires new advances in data fusion and sharing.
* Urban warfare can start in the domain of information, which can reshape the urban environment, as the US joint publication on urban warfare (as cited in PLA writing) has highlighted.
* The PLA sees air power as a means to provide precision support to ground forces and create coercive effects that impact defenders psychologically, all while avoiding politically and economically costly collateral damage, especially in major cities. Beyond traditional airpower, the PLA believes
unmanned systems will offer new utility and flexibility.
* ...close combat remains a central feature of urban warfare and counterterrorism operations; PLA writings recognize this reality. 
* The adaptation of armored vehicles to the demands of urban operations remains a focus of the PLA.
* Coverage in PLA Daily concluded that the Taliban’s focus on “protracted warfare, public opinion warfare, and psychological warfare” enabled the group to eventually seize power.
* During the 2009 exercise, the “city battle” did not center on the city enough to allow for realistic simulation of urban combat. Despite its early
history with urban warfare, the PLA’s lack of recent experience with this style of combat was recognized as a considerable challenge at the time. “Traditional thinking must be changed. The examples of old battles do not explain the problem....To study modern urban warfare, we must have a broad vision and brains,” urged [...] a brigade chief.
* Even parts of the PLA not previously involved in urban warfare have recently begun to be so.
* The PLA regards its aviation assets, especially helicopters, as key components of combined arms and joint operations in urban environments. 
* The 72nd Group Army has also explored new models for “manned and unmanned coordinated operations” (有人无人协同作战), using UAVs for missions that include high-altitude reconnaissance, fixed-point strikes, mine sweeping and detonation, and fire support.
* The PLA’s discussion of urban warfare often focuses on the trend toward “dronification” (无人化). The PLA anticipates urban operations will continue
to evolve in the direction of “unmanned, intangible (i.e., stealthy), and silent” ( 无人、无形（隐形）无声) operations in which remotely operated assets are at the forefront of combat.
* The PLA has increasingly incorporated drones, both aerial and ground, into its urban warfare training in recent years, having found them to be critical to effectively conducting operations. PLA drones include DJI’s “RoboMaster S1” ( 机甲大师S1), a small UGV that the 72nd Group Army has used in urban warfare training.
* To complement its dedicated urban warfare training facilities, the PLA has been working with Chinese technology companies to enhance the realism and
impact of PLA training environments.
* US adaptation of past practices to current challenges will demand a series of paradigm changes. American strategists and practitioners of urban warfare must start to consider the challenges of defending, rather than primarily assaulting, cities.
* US efforts and programs focused on urban warfare should reorient, where relevant, to concentrate on the distinct challenges of the Indo-Pacific operational environment. For instance, existing training facilities focused on
urban warfare should be adapted to simulate cities of greater scale and complexity to reflect that cities in Asia are different from the cities that
have been the focus of much US thinking, practice, and training on urban warfare to date.",bb0e9fe5b08af3829d14971b201b1bca2d6af3a9,True,False,,,,,0,1652330155,,0,{},i8a3gca,True,t3_unsuhc,False,True,t3_unsuhc,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/unsuhc/the_plas_evolving_outlook_on_urban_warfare/i8a3gca/,1652330172,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652301355.0

The Ukrainian counteroffensive north of Kharkiv City has forced Russian troops onto the defensive and has successfully alleviated artillery pressure on Kharkiv City.  
Russian forces continued efforts to encircle Ukrainian positions in the Severodonetsk-Rubizhne-Lysychansk area but did not make any confirmed advances.  
Russian forces may be initiating a new advance towards Bakhmut after capturing Popasna in order to secure highway access north to Slovyansk.  
Russian forces are attempting to consolidate their positions in western Kherson Oblast to push into Mykolaiv Oblast.  
Pro-Russian Telegram sources reported Ukrainian forces may be conducting a counterattack 40km north of Izyum to cut off Russian units in this key town, though ISW cannot confirm these reports at this time.",b9f4ceda69270b6f703dea407ed8c99c9eeb43b2,True,False,,,,,0,1652316636,,0,{},i89bro4,False,t3_un86mu,False,True,t3_un86mu,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/un86mu/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_11_2022/i89bro4/,1652316649,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652287836.0

&gt; Likewise, a charge that Russia had turned to China for potential military help lacked hard evidence, a European official and two U.S. officials said. 
&gt; 
&gt; The U.S. officials said there are no indications China is considering providing weapons to Russia. The Biden administration put that out as a warning to China not to do so, they said.   

&gt; The European official described the disclosure as “a public game to prevent any military support from China.”
&gt; 
&gt; Game or not, U.S. intelligence officials say it has been successful. Intelligence is rarely definitive, and Biden officials have calculated in some cases that it’s better to pre-empt something that might not happen, rather than stay silent and watch it unfold.
&gt; 
&gt; “It doesn’t have to be solid intelligence when we talk about it,” a U.S. official said. “It’s more important to get out ahead of them — Putin specifically — before they do something. It’s preventative. We don’t always want to wait until the intelligence is 100 percent certainty that they are going to do something.

After WMD use, all bets are off as far as i am concerned.

Reactions to threats of WMD use is a sliding scale.

What i am trying to say is that this conflict and the response to it goes beyond Russia and Ukraine. If you are a government that is watching this conflict then you are going to be viewing what can and can not be done to ensure you can not be crippled to the same degree as Russia. There are other options, or other options can be sought that would bypass the wests ability to cripple your country. 

One of the reasons some argued that Russia should not be removed from Swift was there was a Chinese option (CIPS). Now some argued it was not a concern as it was barely used compared to Swift, but by removing Russia from Swift and the economic problems from that shows other countries that maybe CIPS should be an option, this in turn makes CIPS a more valued alternative based on other countries being to use it as a back up so it becomes a viable alternative, degrading the ability to use Swift removal as a threat in the future. Is this going to happen tomorrow?, no but encourages the possibility.

One of the reasons the sanctions are not completely crippling Russia's economy is because German etc still relies on Russian oil and gas supplies. This war has shown Germany that having that dependency was a poor decision and they are taking steps to reduce and remove that dependency. I think it is absurd to think that Russia and other countries are not going to take the same logical steps to reduce dependency on foreign companies to mitigate similar concerns.  

Like oil and gas these options can not be brought online tomorrow, but any foreign policy, you are not just talking about today, you are considering 20 years down the road. So it is logical to assume that in a few years Germany etc will have half a dozen options to secure its energy needs, just as it is logical to assume that countries that do not align with the west's view of things and could face similar threats and actions will have taken steps to mitigate those threats and actions, and likely will have worked together to make them viable alternatives. 

Yes, international trade depends on international partners, and this will not end any time soon but the exposure to risk from that trade can be limited. The sanctions have crippled Russia's ability to make new tanks for example, China is going to be looking at its supply chain and seeing if it has the same weakness, Russia, after this conflict, is going to be doing the same. The world has spent years building globalization as a way of reducing the risk of war, it is far more profitable to talk it out than fight it out.  Depending on how this all plays out the ability to push sanctions thru could be weakened as ""enemies"" have taken steps to mitigate the effect of sanctions.",c84fb41baa13807a52ee299625ee76d556ba011f,True,False,,,,,0,1652315795,,0,{},i899wdy,False,t3_un86mu,False,True,t1_i87he8z,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/un86mu/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_11_2022/i899wdy/,1652315808,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652286995.0

This is how your computer's file browser can show various formatted disks with different file systems connected via various bus systems, NAS, memdisk, etc through a unified interface. Or how all usb mice works the same even if their internal hardware is different. A queue is a FIFO data structure. Whenever you put a queue in a system design they all do the same thing. You have your core logic which should never depend on the underlying queue and a layer that interacts with the actual queue. That last part abstracts the underlying queue so it makes it easy to change what's running underneath. If you have a hard dependency to a queue implementation in your business logic, then you made a mistake in your design.

That's the same way with s3. You have core logic that works with files 'somewhere', it doesn't matter where that file is. You pass url's around and it doesn't matter if they start with s3:// or gs:// or hdfs://.

Even in databases, your core logic should not depend on the actual database implementation. It's a bad idea.

I think you are taking where you work at as the only truth. That's not how it works. I worked when servers run on bare metal and went through AWS dependent times. As always software moves with abstraction and now there really is no need to hard depend on any cloud provider.

Those companies using them doesn't mean they are tied to them. Of course they will use some implementation, that's a given. If they have competent engineers, I guarantee you they are not tied. I work in a company bigger than them and we are not tied at all. And yes, we do use some implementation as we have to. Not only that, we use cloud services interchangeably in prod; the component owners don't even know where exactly it's being run as they don't have to.

Having experience with some components doesn't make you an expert in software. I can tell you are not as you think the cost to switch will be enormous. If you are working in systems where the cost is enormous, there's a deep problem in your engineering culture. It should not be.

Kinda. So Russian tanks are especially awful:

* Soviet-style autoloader design is terrible and autokills the crew if hit (Western tanks don't) and all Russian tanks except T-14 use it
* they have no APS
* Russians have all firepower no support, so their tanks are really poorly protected by infantry and recon
* Russian tanks lack optics for safer engagement, so they get easily ambushed
* Russians lack air support for safer engagement, so they get easily ambushed
* Russians have terrible training
* Russians have terrible logistics and maintenance so even the stuff that should work doesn't half the time

Western armies do better in all of these. They have much better maintenance and training, are much less tank-heavy so tanks would be supported, don't have crew autokill system so hits are much more survivable, and at least some have APS, and between better optics and better air support Western tanks are much more likely to know about enemies instead of getting themselves ambushed.

However, even with these advantages, tanks are definitely way past their peak, which would be like 1973 Yom Kippur War. They serve a niche role at best, and any kind of massed unsupported tank charge like in WW2 would be suicidal against modern ATGMs.

It's a speculation where things will go now, as the future is definitely APS on every vehicle, and thousands of drones everywhere, and maybe tanks don't fit in that future.
