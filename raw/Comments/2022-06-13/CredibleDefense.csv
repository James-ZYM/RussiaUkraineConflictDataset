The problem (for Russia) is there's no world where what they feel is necessary is ultimately all of the Donbas, and they're uh... pretty far from that.

The main reasons (that Ukraine itself can fix right now) Ukraine is struggling right now are

a) while manpower is overabundant, there are serious organizational and logistical issues converting that manpower into combat-ready units

Sun Li-fang, a spokesman for Taiwan’s defense ministry, said that physical fitness requirements for conscripts were eased in line with scientific guidance and the military had to take safety into account in designing its training.

The Tsai administration is considering extending the length of military service to up to a year. It is testing a refresher program for reservists that is two weeks long instead of one, with more hours spent on combat training.

Mr. Wu, the computer engineer, was among the first to take part in the new program. In addition to shooting practice, Mr. Wu said, he and the other reservists trekked on mountain roads to test the group’s ability to carry heavy weapons for long periods of time. By the end, Mr. Wu said, he felt ready for war.

“As long as I have a gun,” he said, “I’ll be ok.”

‘The Tip of the Spear’
On Taiwanese talk shows, pundits and officials debate the probability of a Chinese invasion. In the legislature, lawmakers fret about the preparedness of Taiwan’s troops. In messaging groups, activists discuss ways to involve the public in the island’s defense.

The new urgency reflects a sharp change in attitudes in Taiwan, where many had long been indifferent to China’s advances, resigned to defeat or blindly optimistic about support from the United States.

Ms. Tsai has sought to leverage the Ukraine conflict to push her agenda. She appointed a team of experts to study Ukraine’s strategy. The question is whether she can push through potentially unpopular changes, such as further raising military spending, currently at just over 2 percent of Taiwan’s gross domestic product.

“We cannot see the suffering of the Ukrainian people as news only,” said Alexander Huang, a professor at Tamkang University’s Institute of International Affairs and Strategic Studies. “It’s got to be a lesson that we need to learn.”

Mr. Lee, the former navy chief, and others have urged Taiwan to create a territorial defense force made up of civilians, similar to that of Ukraine’s.

A trained civilian force could be the “tip of the spear” in Taiwan’s defense, said Enoch Wu, founder of Forward Alliance, a nongovernmental group that holds civil defense workshops. “That’s what’s going to make or break Taiwan.”

Some citizens are making their own preparations.

On a recent Saturday, about two dozen people simulated a gunfight in a parking lot near Taipei in a class run by PolarLight, a company that teaches basic first aid and shooting skills, using realistic airsoft guns. They crept around parked cars and buses, aiming their airsoft rifles at imaginary opponents. Some fell to the ground, while others rushed in to move them to safety and apply tourniquets.

Danny Shi, a 21-year-old student at a military academy, said that he had signed up because he was worried that he was not getting enough practical experience at school. He said he wanted to be ready for the worst.

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/13/world/asia/china-taiwan-ukraine-military.html

TAIPEI, Taiwan — Russia’s brutal war in Ukraine has jolted Taiwan into confronting the specter of a sudden attack from the island’s own larger and more powerful neighbor: China.

The invasion has given new weight to the authoritarian vision of China’s leader, Xi Jinping, who has long laid claim to self-governed Taiwan for the “rejuvenation” of China — much as President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia did with Ukraine. To many in Taiwan, Ukraine has been a lesson in the tactics and weaponry that could slow a more powerful invading force. It has also been a stark warning that the island may be inadequately prepared for a full-scale attack.

Taiwan’s defenses are, by many accounts, ill-equipped and understaffed. Its president, Tsai Ing-wen, has vowed to defend the island, but she has struggled to impose a new strategic vision on the uniformed leadership.

Taiwan spends billions on fighter jets and submarines, yet its conscripts barely get enough ammunition for training. The mandatory military service is seen by many as too short, and the reservist program, insufficiently rigorous. The military is building a professional force, but has struggled to recruit and retain highly skilled soldiers.

Now, Ukraine has been an impetus for change.

When Wu Chiuan-syun, a computer engineer in Taipei, gathered with other army reservists in a dense, humid forest in central Taiwan in March, they trained longer and harder than soldiers like them had in recent years. Nearly every day, he said, his commanders would remind the men that the threat from China was growing.

“Ukraine showed us that you need to first show to others that you have the resolve to defend yourself; only then will others come and help,” Mr. Wu, 31, said.

Underlying Taiwan’s defense dilemma is a question left unanswerable by design: Will the United States send military forces to Taiwan’s aid? In May, President Biden suggested he would, but the United States offers no explicit security guarantees, a strategy it hopes will avoid either provoking Beijing or emboldening Taiwan to declare formal independence.

Mr. Xi has said he seeks a peaceful unification with Taiwan, and he may be deterred by the huge economic and diplomatic blowback China would suffer for an invasion. But China has also been pointed in its warnings. Its defense minister, Gen. Wei Fenghe, said over the weekend that Beijing would “fight to the very end” for Taiwan. It is sending fighter jets toward the island almost daily — including 30 aircraft in one day last month alone.

The concern is that such maneuvers could, intentionally or otherwise, be a prelude to conflict.

“We cannot wait; we are competing with time,” said Michael Tsai, a former defense minister of Taiwan. “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine happened in an instant — who knows when the P.L.A. might choose to invade Taiwan.”

The ‘Porcupine Strategy’
Several military drills conducted in January were intended as a show of force to China — to demonstrate how Taiwan planned to stop invaders from intruding on its airspace, landing on its beaches and, in the worst case, taking over its cities.

At an air base in central Taiwan, a siren wailed, and within minutes pilots were taking off in F-16 fighter jets to ward off intruders. Off the northern coast, the navy debuted new mine-laying craft as two small warships fired live ammunition. In a southern city, smoke filled the air as soldiers practicing urban combat shuffled past fake storefronts of bubble tea shops and cafes, exchanging gunfire with combatants.

The drills also reflected a continuing conflict at the heart of Taiwan’s defense strategy.

The original idea, after Nationalist leaders fled to Taiwan in 1949, was to one day reclaim the mainland. For decades, even as that prospect dimmed, Taiwan had approached the threat of an invasion by China by buying or developing traditional, expensive weapons, like the fighter jets showcased at the air base. But Taiwan has been outgunned by China, which invested heavily to build what is now one of the world’s largest militaries.

Seeing the growing imbalance, American officials and some Taiwan strategists have recently accelerated efforts to push Taiwan to instead amass a large number of smaller weapons. That includes naval craft such as the ships in the drill that can quickly lay sea mines to block forces trying to land.

Advocates of the strategy argue that Taiwan, like Ukraine, could easily deploy Stinger missiles, which can be shoulder-launched at aircraft, and portable Harpoon missiles, which can attack ships. Unlike tanks and large battleships, these are hard to target and destroy.

“The idea is to become so hard to swallow that the enemy thinks twice about launching any action,” said Lee Hsi-min, former chief of Taiwan’s Navy and chief of the general staff, who has been among the most vocal proponents in Taiwan for the so-called asymmetric approach.

How many more weapons does Ukraine need to win? This many, a top Ukrainian official says.
Attacked at home, Boris Johnson is honored in Ukraine with a pastry in his image.
Across the river from a crucial battle, residents of Lysychansk wait for what comes next.
An all-out assault on Taiwan, involving air, naval and land forces, would be more complex than Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but some American and Taiwanese defense officials think that in the coming years Beijing would be able to pull it off.

The hope is that if deterrence fails, the so-called porcupine strategy could allow Taiwan to buy time for the United States to possibly help. President Tsai said in 2019 that Taiwan would be able to hold out for 24 hours, and that China would then face international pressure.

Ms. Tsai has purchased Harpoon missiles and other weapons in line with the strategic shift, but she faces resistance from some military leaders. They argue that smaller weapons are not useful for standing up to China in visible ways. Long-range missiles capable of striking the mainland could deter Beijing, the military leaders say. Fighter jets can respond when Chinese forces buzz near Taiwan. The larger platforms are also politically popular.

Should China invade, Taiwan’s defenses will almost certainly crumble unless the United States and its allies help. Some in Taiwan consider it too risky to give up their most lethal weapons without concrete promises of support.

“We can’t be sure that the U.S. will come to rescue us,” said Ou Si-fu, a research fellow at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research, a think tank affiliated with Taiwan’s defense ministry. “Hence, Taiwan needs some strike capabilities. Otherwise, you are binding your hands and waiting to die.”

Improving the Soldiers
Last fall, Hu Yu-huan, 25, reported for his mandatory military service, eager to learn how to defend his homeland. What he found was not boot camp but summer camp.

When he and his fellow conscripts jogged, the pace was set by the slowest man, who tired after 100 yards. They spent hours clearing weeds and sweeping. Mr. Hu, a half-marathon runner, said the four months of service left him 13 pounds heavier and in “the worst shape of my life.”

As Taiwan democratized in the late 1980s, newly elected officials cut the defense budgets, leading to a shrinking force. Taiwan has only around 169,000 active-duty military personnel and around 2 million reservists, compared with China’s two million active-duty soldiers.

The island’s leaders have been seeking to phase out conscription in favor of a professional all-volunteer force. Taiwan’s defense ministry said in a statement that it had reached more than 95 percent of its recruitment goals last year. But experts say the military’s authoritarian legacy, along with the relatively low pay, has made it hard to attract skilled recruits.

Combat training has also been widely criticized as perfunctory, whether for the men over 18 doing mandatory service, like Mr. Hu, or for the reservists. Three decades ago, conscripts had to train for up to three years and run about three miles a day. Now, they serve for four months and run fewer than two miles per day, if at all, according to experts and recent trainees.",7f54f8250b202e7ec2350fd066e99f04f61662d1,True,False,,,,,0,1655164188,,0,{},ic9mb3a,False,t3_vbajh4,False,True,t3_vbajh4,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/vbajh4/weekly_questions_and_comments_thread/ic9mb3a/,1655164201,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1655135388.0

If Iran’s suspicions about the deaths are confirmed, these would be the latest killings in a shadow war that is reaching new intensity as Iran moves closer to nuclear weapons capability.*

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/13/world/middleeast/israel-poison-iranian-scientists.html?referringSource=articleShare

They both graduated from Iran’s top universities — young, healthy and athletic — before they suddenly fell ill in late May. The two scientists grew sicker and sicker, and ended up in the intensive care units of hospitals in two different cities nearly 400 miles apart.

Then, they both died within days of each other.

Iran believes Israel killed them by poisoning their food, according to an Iranian official and two other people with ties to the government who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. One of them, Ayoub Entezari, was an aeronautical engineer who worked for a military research center, and the other, Kamran Aghamolaei, was a geologist.

Compounding the mystery behind their deaths, Israeli media and Persian news channels abroad reported that Mr. Aghamolaei worked at Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility. But friends denied that, and said he worked for a private geological research company, and The New York Times could not corroborate that he had any ties to the government or any weapons program.

Mr. Entezari had a doctorate in aeronautics and worked on projects related to missiles and airplane turbines for a government aerospace center in the city of Yazd, about 390 miles southeast of the capital, Tehran.

He developed symptoms of food poisoning after attending a dinner he was invited to in Yazd, according to a staff member of a senior Iranian official. The host of the dinner party had disappeared and authorities were searching for him, according to the staff member, who could not be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly.

Mr. Aghamolaei had just returned to Tehran from a business trip to the northwestern city of Tabriz when he developed intense nausea and diarrhea that worsened day by day until his organs failed and he died, according to a friend.

If, as Iran suspects, these mysteriously similar deaths were targeted killings, it would fit the pattern of a shadow war with Israel that has seen both sides strike each other with just enough secrecy to avoid a full blown war.

Now that shadow war appears to be intensifying. In the past two weeks alone, a series of deaths linked to Israel have rattled Iran. Israel appears to have broadened its targets from senior figures connected to the nuclear program to military personnel and lower level scientists.

A spokeswoman for the Israeli prime minister’s office declined to comment on the two recent deaths inside Iran.

But Israel has worked clandestinely for years to undermine Iran’s nuclear and weapons programs, including by targeted killings of experts involved in those endeavors. It has also attacked Iranian military sites developing advanced drones and missiles.

Iran, in turn, has tried to target Israeli citizens around the world, and armed and funded regional militias hostile to Israel, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon.

But much of the conflict has centered around the nuclear program.

Israel staunchly opposes the efforts, albeit faltering, to resurrect the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers — which President Donald J. Trump pulled out of in 2018. The agreement eased punishing economic sanctions on Tehran in exchange for limiting Iran’s nuclear activity.

Israel feels the deal does not limit Iran’s nuclear activities enough at a time when it is deeply concerned that the country is within close reach of producing enough enriched uranium to make a nuclear weapon.

Supporters of the nuclear deal, however, say it will limit Iran’s uranium enrichment, allow the United Nations nuclear watchdog to resume monitoring of the Iranian nuclear program and reduce the threat of Iran developing nuclear weapons.

Iran has long maintained that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only. But an American intelligence assessment years ago concluded that the country once had a nuclear weapons program, then halted it in 2003.

If the negotiations to revive the 2015 nuclear deal collapse and Iran accelerates its nuclear activities or further reduces cooperation with U.N. monitors, the covert war with Israel risks blowing up into an open conflict.

“Whether or not there is a nuclear deal, this type of activity will likely intensify — Iran extending its reach around Israel, Israel extending its reach deeper inside of Iran,” said Henry Rome, an Iran analyst with the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy.

The quickening pace of attacks in Iran, taken together with recent comments by Israeli leaders, suggest a shift in Israel’s strategy.

“The past year has been a year of changing course in Israel’s strategy vis-à-vis Iran,” Prime Minister Naftali Bennett of Israel said on Tuesday at a meeting of the parliamentary foreign affairs and defense and foreign affairs committee. “We have shifted into a higher gear. We are acting at all times and places, and we will continue to do so.”

Over the past two weeks in Iran, a senior member of the powerful Revolutionary Guards Corps, Sayad Khodayee, was targeted and killed in a drive-by shooting in Tehran. A young Defense Ministry engineer was killed in a drone attack. And another senior member of the Revolutionary Guards fell suspiciously to his death from a balcony.

Then, the two scientists died.

Mr. Entezari, 35, died on May 31. A colleague from the military research facility where he worked said on social media that he had been well the night before he suddenly fell ill, and Iranian media reported that nobody else in his family had gotten sick, although they had all eaten the same food.

The governor of Yazd Province, where he lived, presented his family with a framed certificate of condolence that deemed him “a martyr” and thanked the family for its sacrifice to the nation. Iran bestows the label martyr as an honor on those killed by enemy fire or in the line of duty to their country. A City Council member in Yazd called his death “biological terror.”

But in the face of Israel’s repeated breaches of Iranian security, officials quickly pulled back on calling Mr. Entezari a martyr and on other details that could point to another Israeli attack — something that could potentially embarrass the authorities.

The governor’s public relations office retracted the martyr reference two days later, saying it was an error. The prosecutor’s office in Yazd denied Mr. Entezari was an aerospace engineer, and instead said he was an ordinary employee of an industrial company.

Photographs and videos published in Iranian media dating to 2019 show Mr. Entezari making a presentation to then-President Hassan Rouhani at the Ghadir Industrial Turbines Company, where Mr. Entezari worked. These images were consistent with the notion that he worked at this government facility, and a statement from his university’s alumni association said he was indeed an aerospace engineer.

Mahmoud Entezari, a relative who leads tours in Yazd, said on his Instagram page that the engineer had worried that his life was in danger after the photographs of him with Mr. Rouhani surfaced in local media. The photographs, he had told his relative, were supposed to remain confidential.

When reached for comment, Mahmoud Entezari refused.

Iranian officials have been even quieter about Mr. Aghamolaei, 31, who died on June 2.

The only official mention of Mr. Aghamolaei’s death was a condolence statement from the president of Tarbiat Modares University in Tehran, which said he was a doctoral student in geology. The statement then claimed he had died of a heart attack in his hometown, Izeh, a small, working-class area in the southern Khuzestan Province.

[],False,,BigBlueButtonMan2,,,[],,,,text,t2_fvf8jh6z,False,False,"So, based on the last couple of days of assessing Ukraine's strategy, what could Ukraine reasonably be expected to do in this situation?

There's some agreement that they need to employ a flexible, mobile defense, that emphasizes catching Russians in the open and hitting them with fires when they're exposed instead of a strict defense like what they're employing. 

However, Ukraine would need to have areas where they can reasonably be expected to train and work on their army in relative peace, and the Russians have apparently been willing to deep strike places where the Ukrainians are training troops, all the way out to the Polish border.

I can think of some theoretical solutions, such as some sort of radar alert system so they can hide, and outsourcing as much of their trainees to other countries as they can. But I'm not sure how in line this is with the situation on the ground.

Would this just be a risk they have to accept, to create a proper army for potential counteroffensives?

The Russians, in such a lull, at least when they finally culminate and can't advance anymore, would also be afforded the chance to actually fix the rest of their manpower problems. I don't think the DPR/LNR troops are ever going to be as effective as a batch of 20-30 years ready to be trained, but 3 months of relative peace is 3 months to train them on machine guns, basic heavy weapons (like RPGs), and other such things for defensive roles. They would also be able to continue their shadow mobilization and get those troops into defensive positions as well. 

A couple others have also been curious about their force structure; I remember a comment discussing that Ukraine's Kherson attacks are using insufficient force structure, which at least might be explaining why their progress in Kherson is a little slow.

Basically, what kind of ""sweet spot"" is there between just preparing for the offensives and waiting for heavy artillery to arrive (with the proper training), and damaging the Russians enough with an offensive in mind?

Because it is clear at this point that even though Russia is absolutely desperate for manpower, it's also clear Ukraine on the offensive, with a properly fully trained army, would be fighting a force 100,000-200,000 strong, probably closer to the upper end, if they actually took the operation pause they need. And once the Russians get whatever they feel is necessary from the Donbass, they'll start fortifying *everything.*

Up-arming Ukraine should, of course, not be limited to artillery and artillery parity will not win Ukraine the war.

That's true if you want to end up in LEO, but it's more than double what you'd need if you just want to hit the target.

That 4km/sec delta-V from LEO to GEO is expended in two burns.   A bit more than half raises apogee from LEO altitude to GEO altitude and puts you into a GTO (geosynchronous transfer orbit), and the rest is burned at GEO altitude (GTO apogee) to raise perigee to GEO altitude.

Generally the first burn is done by the launch vehicle's last stage, and the second burn is done by the spacecraft.   Depending on the inclination of the launch site you may end up with a GTO-1500 or GTO-1800  (1500 m/s to 1800m/s required to get from GTO to GEO).

That rate of troop deaths being taken by the Ukrainians is high, even if you accept Zelenskyy's figures on face value. Zelenskyy also said that Selverdonesk was going to be the decisive point in the battle of the Donbas, and now that city is all but lost with holdouts in the Azot chemical plant and pockets in the west. The Ukrainians look to be using delaying tactics, which are working, but at a heavy cost. The Russians are taking losses too, but remember they haven't even called for general mobilization and are playing weird games to avoid it, but if called the war's scope expands as that bear is hard to put back to sleep once fully mobilized.

The gamble is on the weapon systems and brief training with them turns the war and creates artillery parity, with that the Ukrainians are able to drive the Russians out and then have peace talks. I dont think anyone is any longer under the belief that the sanctions would bring an end to the war, so not worth discussing further.

 I see the idea that Ukraine will de-occupt itself as extremely unlikely, for a few reasons. 

- the amount of weapons, and the delays
- the Russians knowing the amount of weapons to look for
- weapon systems sent without high tech targeting systems like the M777s.
- poor training 
- but the big one, NATO is already having internal discussions about limiting the amount of arms sent to Ukraine and are even moving to pushing to peace talks, where concessions are expected. The initial support of the war is getting hammered by economic impacts... pressure is growing and cracks growing. 

I suspect that the west will pivot towards pushing for peace talks increasingly. They have already started to, beginning with Kissinger in Davos, then Macron, then Biden (tho that comes with an asterisk). As concerns about food shortages and fertilizer shortages mount the Russians will need to be dealt with diplomatically and that is gonna be difficult after the posture since the war started.

I'd question that.

Per the latest Western estimate ([June 9](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/jun/09/russia-ukraine-war-latest-zelenskiy-says-sievierodonetsk-seeing-most-difficult-fighting-so-far-in-war-live?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with:block-62a22d5d8f08d1b0648fbb18#block-62a22d5d8f08d1b0648fbb18)), Russia and its proxies have lost between 15,000 and 20,000 KIA. The previous estimate was already above 15,000, so I'd assume the best figure is closer to 20,000.

Also on [June 9](https://uacrisis.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Losses-9.06.jpeg), Ukraine estimated having ""liquidated"" 31,700 Russian and proxy personnel. Although Zelenskyy is on the record as categorizing them as ""dead"", it's unclear if the definition corresponds to ""KIA"" or overall dead through combat, including soldiers dying from their wounds away from the battlefield.

Thus, as of June 9 we have the following estimates:

\-15,000 KIA: Per Western sources, the absolute floor and almost certainly an underestimate  
\-20,000 KIA: Per Western sources and likely the better figure  
\-31,700 KIA: Per Ukraine and either an overestimate or an estimate of KIA + DOW

As for Ukraine, on [April 19](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/19/world/ukraine-russia-donbas-offensive.html) U.S. intelligence estimated a range of 5,500 - 11,000 KIA over the first 55 days of the war, which amounts to 100 - 200 KIA per day. Given what we know of Ukrainian difficulties during the current phase, it's unlikely that Ukraine is suffering lower casualties today. If anything, the current range of 100 - 200 KIA per day might be an undercount on Ukraine's part.

Finally, Ukraine's estimates of ""liquidated"" Russian-led personnel is substantially lower in this second phase, averaging \~148 over the past 3 weeks. Given the aforementioned issues with the Ukrainian data, we can conclude with a reasonable degree of certainty that current attrition isn't favorable to Ukraine.",254113f26f47eaf712e6777051456ca9e8d2da08,True,False,,,,,0,1655155929,,0,{},ic94bbu,False,t3_vbajcy,False,True,t1_ic90kt8,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/vbajcy/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_13_2022/ic94bbu/,1655155947,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1655127129.0

However, you'll face a pretty severe discrimination protocol. Anyone that's lived in a dense apartment building with thin walls that enough access points will produce interference that severely degrades performance, in the worst case, making the network effectively unusable.

Our ELINT sat faces the same problem, but the potential set of sources is everything within its antenna field of view. Potentially millions. That's tough, but not entirely unsurmountable. In particular if we have multiple antennas, we can use interferometric processing to synthesize a more directional aperture. I still feel like this is a really big ask for wifi signals due to their structure (not designed for these distances, latencies) and very high density.

By way of comparison, satphones emit a \~10 W ""hello"" signal so that the satellite can acquire the handset. So they start out with a +20 dBm advantage, but also the signal structure is explicitly designed for this situation, unlike wifi.

So that's a long winded way of saying I think it's really really difficult, but I can't quite say it's impossible.",96a563d20ef6548cf846e634b436a22b3c34503c,True,False,,,,,0,1655155604,,0,{},ic93kfm,False,t3_vazev1,False,False,t1_ic69v6p,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/vazev1/commercial_satellites_are_national_securitys_next/ic93kfm/,1655155618,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1655126804.0

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"&gt;How many Sherman tanks do you think the Suez Canal is worth?

I again am wondering why you are bringing up historical examples when you don't know history.

The battle of El Alamein that had the Shermans was the 2nd battle, which wasn't about who controlled the Suez, the previous battle without Shermans had already decided that. 2nd El Alamein was fought after Rommel was already begging Hitler to retreat, who didn't allow it because of the political stink of a retreat (Zelensky Severondonesk rings a bell). 

And that British offensive was supposed to fully rout and destroy most of Rommel's Axis army and drive the remnants all the way back to Tunisia where the American-British forces would clobber it . Instead, Rommel got away largely intact because Monty and the Shermans didn't pursue him, because by his own admission Monty didn't trust the Eighth Army in the pursuit, Shermans or not. 

Meanwhile, 1st Armored Div, which was critical in the attempt to reach Tunisia, didn't have the ability to reach it with enough fighting power before it was reinforced. Which started a six month long campaign to win in that theater. After a battle that the US Army was largely thrust into because of poor British leadership (British First Army), with inferior tanks, that caused the British to start shit talking American fighting ability and professionalism which they kept up for the rest of the war. 

So yeah, really good  investment!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;How much are 1k Bradleys worth to the US army?

A single ABCT uses 152x Bradleys, and there are only 10x of those ABCT in active duty and another 5x in inactive duty. And you want our mechanized infantry capabilities to go bye bye forever so Ukraine can attempt a counteroffensive they still wont be able to do without everything else they just demanded (tanks, artillery, trucks, ammo, parts, supplies, training for everything). 

If you're Ukrainian then surely ""Hell yes"" is your answer. If you're not, a ""fuck no"" is the answer. Any country that endangers their own national security to win upvotes while #SlavaUkraini is trending are goddamn fools. Support should be done sensibly, without online zealots who have zero understanding of military matters controlling the narrative.  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;they thought generals and military guys were idiots who didn't understand balance between civilian economy and military strength

You didn't even read that damn quote. Because it has nothing to do with military versus civilian, that is about military vs military, that entire quote was about interservice rivalry. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I simply must find men who have the breadth of understanding and devotion to their country rather than to a single Service that will bring about better solutions than I get now.

The service is their branch of service. During Ike's adminstration every branch was fighting over breadcrumbs left by the USAF, who Ike supported, which pissed off the Army especially, who worked dilligently under the JFK to unfuck the mess left by the Eisenhower administration in terms of how grossly unprepared for war that he had left the US Army. Ever hear of Pentomic Divisions? Ike is bitching that not enough US Army generals were going along with that concept. 

 

&gt;USA emptying Army stocks even active units if it leads to Russia's defeat is more in the service of this country than a more prepared Army.

Since the US Army doesn't exist to defeat Russia but is designed to deal with a global threat, you are still speaking falsehoods. You are promising that there will be no negative repercussions to this, which is a total bullshit assessment that ends with America as a country endangered. All to show how much you are #SlavaUkraini on Reddit.

Sending the amount of equipment the Zelensky govt is now saying they need  to ""end the war"" took decades to manufacture and field in the first place, wont be returned, and so does not equate to ""temporarily decreasing the readiness."" That is turning the US Army of 2022 into the US Army of 1914 with no means to rebuild it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If U.S needed it's full capabilities all the time how could it ever lose any tanks in a war against an enemy?

Because we intended to win the conflict with what we possessed with our standing army, active and reserves. If not, we had no real fallback plan. 

There is no corresponding plan for mass mobilization and an Arsenal of Democracy that happened in WW2, because the US planned that out from the 1920-30s, took the better part of half a decade to just create the barest foundation of it before it able to augment the force. Before WW2, our US Army was smaller than the current USMC and about as well equipped as Portugal. The fix for that was the plan to mass mobilize the military, which included major mobilization of the economy too, with planning done by the military to know previous capabilities, who could expand and exactly how, allocation of resources, etc.  

That is not the current plan, which is for the active duty force structure of a large and very well equipped standing DOD to fight and win the war, with limited amounts of reserve component (including National Guard) needed. The worst case scenario is while the active duty is getting destroyed in a war that somehow hasn't turned America into a radioactive wasteland, it buys enough time for a full reserve component mobilization along with an attempt to modernize limited amount of mothballed equipment to feed to units already in the fight to make up for lost equipment. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;They'd be instantly incapable of defending themselves apparently.

If the US stripped ourselves of the equipment that Ukraine wants, we would be incapable of defending US global interests. Which means we either use other weapons as a deterrent, to include nukes. Or else we retreat. No offense to Ukraine, but that is not an acceptable risk. 

Plus, all of this assumes the sacrifices we make in terms of robbing ourselves to pay them will end positively because Ukraine will be both grateful and use it smartly.

- Russian imports have dropped like a rock

- Russian manufacturing is taking a hit especially it's auto industry and this will likely extend over to the Russian Military Industrial Complex as well 

- It's aviation industry is on the verge of collapse thanks to sanctions

- It's still taking fairly heavy materiel losses every week, even artillery despite already lost 4.346k materiel losses. The non-artillery materiel losses could become very pressing (can in the case of tanks considering the T-62s) and while the surplus in artillery can help offset the losses, it's unlikely that Russia can replace at the rate they're losing them. Even if Russian manufacturing wasn't heavily it, it would be unlikely for it to quickly replenish the losses they're taking 

- Russia is still taking heavy losses of personnel even despite the current artillery duel in the east favoring them and the DPR and LPR have been devastated. There's also evidence that they don't have a healthy refreshment of those troops especially in the DPR and LPR. No country with a healthy recruitment flow or taking healthy causalities opens up recruitment and volunteering to 40 year old men (yes this extends to Ukraine as well) 

- There is evidence that Russian forces in the south are spread out and thin along with having lesser gear. It's still clear that Ukraine doesn't have enough weaponry or men (mostly heavy materiel like artillery, IMV, AMV, Tanks, etc.) to truly break through but there has been evidence that Ukraine has slowly gained ground in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia

This doesn't mean that the picture in the east doesn't slightly favour Russia thanks to Russia's superiority in artillery and some boneheaded decisions made in the region as well, but I would hesitate before taking a definitive stance on what this current state of the war will mean for either party

&gt; 
&gt; Do you really want to use example that to win your argument to strip the US Army or other NATO militaries?

Absolutely, it's the perfect example for the bigger picture point.

How many Sherman tanks do you think the Suez Canal is worth? The Russian Caucus front? 300? 30k? It's a perfect example because despite the short term damage to the US army, the strategic disaster avoided was immense. 

How much are 1k Bradleys worth to the US army? Is the defeat of Russia(Feb 23rd lines potential Putin gov overthrown etc) worth 1k Bradleys? The answer is hell yes. 

I'm not referencing the MIC with JFK or Eisenhower, I'm referencing how as Presidents(not generals) they thought generals and military guys were idiots who didn't understand balance between civilian economy and military strength. 

&gt;“Eisenhower told Swede that his “most frustrating domestic problem” was with the leadership of the armed services.
I patiently explain over and over again that American strength is a combination of its economic, moral and military force. If we demand too much in taxes in order to build planes and ships, we will tend to dry up the accumulations of capital that are necessary to provide jobs for the millions of new workers that we must absorb each year.… I simply must find men who have the breadth of understanding and devotion to their country rather than to a single Service that will bring about better solutions than I get now.”

Excerpt From: Jean Edward Smith. “Eisenhower in War and Peace.” Apple Books. 

No it's not a one to one comparison.

&gt;Oh please, it's politics. They've been begging for Marders from Germany. Germany doesn't want the Marders. 

You're right, it is politics. Which is why Germany, despite not even wanting that stuff, isn't giving it up. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Does Ukraine fighting Russia not lower the requirements of the US Army? 

To some extent for the US Army, yes. But the US Army doesn't exist to fight Russia, only a small portion of it was forward deployed to deal with it, and it has global responsibilities far larger than just Russia. 

The US Army also thinks it has a role in fighting Russia, which is still a possibility it believes is true (as does others, like Kofman), who are warning not to discount the Russians are you are now. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In a fight against Russia assuming the stockpiles were lower for the Army why would the USAF not be able to slap a much weakened Russia?

For the same reason the USAF has never strategically a single enemy without nukes. Because its incapable of doing that. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It's the soldiers job to fight with what he has. It's the politicians and civilian jobs to decide whether that equipment is better in a soldiers rainy day fund or fighting Russia right now.

And its the general/flag officers' job to preserve their branch of service and protect it so dangerously naive politicians and civilians don't make drastic mistakes because they can't see past their nose. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It's like Roosevelt and Marshall taking 300 Shermans from the 1st Armored for El Alamein

Which is a perfect example of the repercussions of robbing Peter to pay Paul. 

By making that decision, the 1st AD invaded North Africa, had all sorts of problems that culminated in the battle of Kasserine Pass, lost at least partly due to shitty tanks. 

Do you really want to use example that to win your argument to strip the US Army or other NATO militaries? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Quite frankly your arguments only confirm JFK and Eisenhower's theory of military dudes.

Again with the shitty examples. You clearly don't even know what Ike said (let alone JFK) because nothing they said was about ""military dudes."" FFS, Eisenhower was a five star general. 

Ike's case was against the dangers of the corporate run defense industry, manufacturers of weaponry acquired largely by USAF who had incredible sway over the civilian Congress and media. The Military Industrial Complex wasn't staffed by ""military dudes."" 

And this is again a perfect counterargument like the 1st AD tanks. A bunch of blowhard civilians manipulating politicians and media using fear as a weapon to acquire weapons.  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Do you want a strong Army or a strong USA? 

Both. I want Ukraine to beat Russia but not at our expense. Especially if Ukraine is going to act like ungrateful beggars, making unrealstic and outright foolish demands, while trying to shift blame to the US for their own blunders:

I wanna address this point because you're specifically in the army or a vet.

Some of the complaints about equipment being needed in case of a fight is quite odd when Russia is literally fighting right now...

Does Ukraine fighting Russia not lower the requirements of the US Army? In a fight against Russia assuming the stockpiles were lower for the Army why would the USAF not be able to slap a much weakened Russia?

It's the soldiers job to fight with what he has. It's the politicians and civilian jobs to decide whether that equipment is better in a soldiers rainy day fund or fighting Russia right now.

It's like Roosevelt and Marshall taking 300 Shermans from the 1st Armored for El Alamein. 

Quite frankly your arguments only confirm JFK and Eisenhower's theory of military dudes.

Do you want a strong Army or a strong USA? because a strong army that doesn't sacrifice to help Ukraine would result in a weaker USA even with a stronger Army.",559e48c53ea0b6777c197cef810468e60dda40d5,True,False,,,,,0,1655142917,,0,{},ic89l7e,False,t3_vbajcy,False,True,t1_ic87y1h,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/vbajcy/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_13_2022/ic89l7e/,1655142928,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1655114117.0

Adding Finland and Sweden to NATO gives the West firm control of the Baltic, from which direct attacks on St Petersburg and the Russian heartlands become more attractive. This heavily dilutes Turkey's importance to the West, and Erdoğan doesn't want that.

Turkey's relationship with Russia is a bit weird and certainly more complex than simply ""competitor.""

[],False,,LordOfBirds,,,[],,,,text,t2_3fmejac0,False,False,"I am feeling quite pessimistic about the war as well. Ultimately the conditions needed for Ukraine to win are predicated on 2 things: Russia finally running out of their limited manpower allocated to this war and Ukraine generating fresh well trained and well equipped brigades for a large counteroffensive which needs to happen before Russia accomplishes its territorial goals.

I have said before that the war will be decided in July/August when the two factors above will likely become clear. I am sticking by it, but so far things are looking bleak for Ukraine. While everyone was focused on Putin comparing himself to Peter the Great, something that struck me more was him talking about how that war lasted for 25 years despite all the problems Russia was having and culminated obviously in the Russian victory. This tells me that he is preparing for a long war, and if so, knowing full well the Russian ongoing losses and the replenishment tempo, he has a plan to maintain the necessary amount of manpower for the war. The second factor of the Ukrainians generating large well trained, well equipped reserves , so far has not manifested itself at all and in fact the ferocity with which they are trying to hold on to Severodonetsk seems to imply that the best forces and equipment are being concentrated there.

In the meantime NATO seems to be confused about what to provide or not, when it's clear that Europe is tapped out and the US either needs to step up its support several times over or watch Ukraine slowly sink (so far it looks like the US is choosing the latter). The timing of the impending economic recession is likely to further undermine that support.

While it is true that so far the pace of the Russian advance is extremely slow, I don't think that we can just assume that this pace will remain the same. If the Ukrainians reach the point of exhaustion in that sector, both equipment wise and manpower-wise, the pace of advance will greatly accelerate. The good thing is that beyond Severodonetsk and Lysichansk Ukraine controls extremely fortified Slovyansk and Kramatorsk which may rival Mariupol in their defensive strength, but if too much is lost trying to hold on to Severodonetsk, that will negatively impact Ukraine's ability of holding Slovyansk and Kramatorsk.

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"&gt;Ukraine doesn't have a good answer to that strategy

And whose fault is that? 

Countless armies since WW1 have come up with ways to address fighting an enemy with overwhelming fires advantage, and at no time was a static defense ever the right choice. Especially when its clear the static defenses are insufficient for the fires. 

Before the battle of the Severodonetsk salient started, was there anything at stake in that area of operations that required Ukraine to destroy their own military to prevent falling in the hands of the Russians? I can't think any geographical reasons that sector needed to be held, which means the center of gravity for the UA wasn't geographic. Then what was it?  

Remember when the UA was already talking nationwide counteroffensive before this campaign started? Whatever happened to that? 

For that to work they needed two things: an overextended and exhausted RUF and a fresh UAF. Did their strategy in the Donbas seem to reflect that? They should have been trying to conserve their existing active duty forces in the Donbas, coinciding with more reserves and TDF being turned into trained, organized, and cohesive fighting units filled with motivated veterans, who would be well armed with Western military equipment takes time to arrive in numbers, train on, etc, and then when the Russians reached their culmination point, regardless of what they'd taken, to start the counteroffensives.   

Instead, they did the opposite. They voluntarily went toe to toe with an opponent in the manner that played to their opponent's strength. 

This reminds me of Rhonda Rousey, a Judo expert, deciding she wanted to win her championship fights as a striker against striker experts to prove she was the best all-around fighter, and then getting knocked the fuck out. Well, no shit.

Why did UA switch to the strategy that land was worth more than lives? And if they made that decision, why are they bitching as if someone else forced their hand? 

At what point in this campaign did they realize the Russians had an artillery advantage that incoming arms from the West couldn't fix? And why didn't they alter their strategy to reflect that reality? Why are they fighting a bad plan? 

Everyone fucks up in war, that's a guarantee. The question is how often, and how dangerous are the repercussions? But what I can't stomach is the spin doctor game to try to turn UA failures into the failures by the West to not give them the fires to outgun the Russians.

Everyone knew the war of movement had stopped, no one knew how much it would take to get the fronts moving again or how much of a beating either side was willing to take. 

There are so many contingencies in the overall conflict all we can do is watch it unfurling in real time. What we can do is watch for the relative effectiveness and number of attacks by each side. Those are public and can't be fudged for long. So I am waiting to see how that shifts. Can the Russians keep grinding out gains in Donbas? Can Ukraine sustain their little pushes in the south?

The ability to conduct limited offence the the bedrock of the posture instead of the conventional superiority that would be employed in reaction to a Pakistani provocation.

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"&gt;Hilarious you managed to call Ukraine a toddler while exhibiting class A toddler logic

Toddler logic is holding their breath thinking they'll get their way. Which is akin to what Zelenksy is doing if he, the subservient partner in his relationship, thinks he can punk out the most powerful people in the world using the very media apparatus they control.

Here is some dog logic to go along with the toddler logic: ""Never bite the hand that feeds you.""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;No one other than you thinks its ungrateful to literally ask for faster weapons to defeat our greatest geopolitical enemy in the last century while they're dying by the hundreds.

its is normal for the beggar to demand more and more, despite getting so much, that's unfortunately what beggars often do and why many don't like giving to charity, because so often they find out its a scam.

But its not normal for the beggar to craft a media campaign to blame the patrons for all their problems as well. That is straight up stupid. Not only is it disloyal to attack the patron, its COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. There is a thin line between being pushy (which is understandable but annoying) to being outright dangerous. Zelensky crossed that line by concocting an orchestrated media campaign to push the narrative that the current crisis is the West's fault.

You're correct to mention geopolitics (though you did make a ridiculous bombastic claim about the greatest geopolitical enemy in a century, since 1937-45 is less than a hundred years ago). But the point is real, geopolitics matters. And that is more than the long term threat of Putin and Russian expansion, that is also the short term threat of Zelensky trying to use western media to attack Western leadership, to hurt their individual polling numbers, to hurt their chances of reelection, to try to shoulder them personally with the blame for Ukraine's military problems, including the many self inflicted ones.

And its not toddlerish at all to consider that the most ruthless and powerful leaders in the Western world will accept being treated like a subservient bitch by Zelensky. That's called politics.

Which means if he and his #SlavaUkraini mob followers keep it up, Zelensky likely ends up fired because the West will straight up tell his govt that they refuse to deal with Ukraine with him in power (which will force his resignation).

Or those leaders just wash their hands and push publicly for a peace deal while drying up arms shipments to UA because its easier to deal with that outcome then to deal with rogue Zelensky and his army of online supporters for years to come.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I don't think I've seen a more stupid take. Thank god people in charge aren't petty toddlers like yourself.

There is at least one person who thinks like me. Unfortunately for UA, he lives in the White House:

[WaPo: Biden says Zelensky ‘didn’t want to hear’ U.S. warnings of invasion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/11/biden-zelensky-russia-invasion-warnings-putin/)

So shocking that the leading patron of Ukraine, the one chiefly responsible for UA gaining so much Western support beyond Poland, would publicly turn on Zelensky! I'm sure it was just a gaff and in no way reflected a thought out pushback against Zelensky's petty media campaign.

Meanwhile, let's see how the Zelensky govt responded to that. Did they treat it as a gaff, and just ignore it and not rise to the bate? 

[The Hill: Ukrainian officials push back on Biden claim that Zelensky ‘didn’t want to hear’ invasion warnings](https://thehill.com/policy/international/3520116-ukrainian-officials-push-back-on-biden-claim-that-zelensky-didnt-want-to-hear-invasion-warnings/)

Nope, they responded with an even more aggressive counterattack then they've managed to launch against the Russians. Stepping up the rhetoric by laughably trying to shape a new narrative that the real cause for the war was Biden not doing more preemptive sanctions and other drastic steps before the invasion. 

Such adult behavior. Not at all inflammatory and cause for concern. And not at all an indication of an ever fracturing alliance. Nope, this is just a healthy alliance that would make the ghosts of FDR, Churchill, and Stalin smile in approval.

We also haven't seen a TB2 strike video in quite some time, nor have we seen much evidence of Ukrainian SOF in action.

I think the evidence does point to the UAF having lost a huge, perhaps debilitating amount of its professional/highly capable front line troops and SOF and is now heavily reliant on TDF and other conscript forces to hold the line. This is not good for Ukraine, and greatly reduces its ability to mount large scale offenses and increases the risk of eventual rout.

Well this is totally not true. Ignores everything happening against the salient not in Severodonetsk itself.

All the negative press about Ukraine casualties and losses for the last week was a calculated media spin campaign to demand more supplies and shift blame. 

""Ukraine is not at fault, this is all the result of the failures of the West. Give us more or our deaths and failures are entirely on you.""

This reminds me of a toddler holding their breath unless parents buy them the toy they want. It's not going to work.

Proxies are not the dominant partner in the relationship between them and their patrons. Even if the proxy wants to be more powerful, they cannot. If they were powerful, they wouldn't need to go hat in hand begging others for help. But you know what all patrons hate? What everyone who ever contributed to charity hates? Ungratefulness. And that's what we see here. Not just beggars who are choosers, but beggars who get more than any proxy in the history of war have gotten in such a short period and yet still using the media to try to amateurishly pressure the patrons for even more, while taking it up another notch and declaring all the problems they face are because of the patrons. Which is infinitely worse than just demanding more.

This approach doesn't work with children trying to get the toy they want from parents, why would it work against the most ruthless and conniving politicians in the West, who were crushing their political enemies when Zelensky was still a zygote? 

If the Ukraine spin doctors and their overzealous #SlavaUkraini followers keep this up, they're just screwing themselves. They are entirely dependent on Western support for survival and they think they have the dominant role that they can punk out the West by using social media to rub the noses of the leadership of the West in shit? 

That's going to likely end with Zelensky having to resign because the West refuses to work with him anymore, especially when they start publicly attacking him more over his incompetent war handling (they already started this). Or it'll mean more of the West washes their hands of this mess and pushes for negotiated settlement that favors Russia, because that's a better outcome for them than having to take shit from ungrateful beggars.

What's going to be obvious is after Ukraine loses this war they and their online supporters will try to spin it that Russian bots were the ones actually responsible for burning the bridges using a propaganda driven fake news campaign to break the alliance.

I would assume (maybe naively) that - assuming they are actually trying to help - if things were as dire as is claimed and it were possible to transfer the necessary weaponry in a timely fashion they would be doing so.

There are any number of restraints on the provision of weapons. They can be political (both domestic and international), strategic (do we want UA to have these weapons, even if they will help? Are we in a position to deplete our own stockpiles to dangerous levels? etc), financial, logistical (can we physically deliver them? Can we keep them functional on an ongoing basis?), practical (if we deliver them, can they even use them?). You can even throw in things like moral /ethical constraints (likely apply to the germans for example).

&gt;[With a substantial stockpile of weapons, few barriers to accessing arms and millions of small arms and light weapons on the black market, Ukraine is believed to have one of the largest arms trafficking markets in Europe. While it has long been a key link in the global arms trade, its role has only intensified since the beginning of the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Most arms are reportedly trafficked domestically, but the illicit arms trade is also linked to criminal arms markets in Russia, Belarus, Moldova, Georgia and Turkey, as well as countries in the EU and the former Yugoslavia. Within Ukraine, the cities of Odessa, Dnipro, Kharkiv, and Kyiv are significant logistical centres for criminal networks. The increasing number of arms combined with relatively limited controls and conflict in parts of eastern Ukraine have resulted in a sharp increase in the size of the criminal market for small arms and light weapons, particularly Makarov and Tokarev pistols, AK-pattern assault rifles and Dragunov sniper rifles. Additionally, there is a smaller market for light machine guns. Firearm seizures have been the largest in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, where fighting has been the most intense.

[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/12/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-eu.html)

June 12, 2022  
Thomas Gibbons-Neff and Matina Stevis-Gridneff

LYSYCHANSK, Ukraine — With Russia about to encircle Sievierodonetsk, a city critical to its goal of seizing Ukraine’s east, and with a neighboring city squarely in Moscow’s sights, the question of how realities on the ground will shape the next phase of the war became still more pressing Sunday for Ukraine’s Western allies.  
  
“The Russians are making every effort to cut off Sievierodonetsk,” the regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, said Sunday on Telegram, the messaging app. “The next two or three days will be significant.”  
  
Across the river, Ukrainians trying to hold fast against the Russians in Lysychansk had the advantage of good terrain — but dwindling weaponry to defend it with.

“If there is no help with military equipment, of course they will drive us out,” said Oleksandr Voronenko, 46, a military police officer stationed in Lysychansk. “Because everyday the equipment is destroyed. You have to replace it with something new.”

Ukrainian officials have been imploring NATO allies for faster delivery of longer-range weapons, and the urgently needed replenishment of still more basic supplies, including ammunition.  
  
**But with the momentum of the war shifting more decisively in Russia’s favor, Ukraine’s allies, their economies threatened and their resolve tested, may soon find themselves forced to confront far more fundamental questions than what sort of weapons to provide, including whether to put pressure on Ukraine to reach a peace agreement with Russia or risk Russian escalation with more aggressive military support.**  
  
“There was always a sense that, when the center of gravity shifted to the south and east, there would be the potential for greater Russian gains based on greater mass and their existing territorial acquisitions,” said Ian Lesser, a former American official who heads the Brussels office of the German Marshall Fund.  
  
“But it does raise more serious longer-term questions about the nature of the conflict, Ukraine’s aims and Western aims in relation to those,” he said.  
  
As Ukrainians wait, they are suffering horrific losses in the Donbas region where the fight for Sievierodonetsk is playing out. By Ukraine’s own assessment, it is losing between 100 and 200 people a day as the bloodshed there worsens, in part because of Russian material superiority and in part because of Ukraine’s determination to fight on despite the increasingly bleak picture in the east.  
  
Those Western supplies that have made it through to the front line are neither as plentiful or as sophisticated as Ukraine would like. And some never even make it into battle, hit by Russian strikes before they can even be deployed.  
**Late Saturday, Russian missiles hit a military warehouse in western Ukraine, wounding nearly two dozen people, and, according to Russia’s Defense Ministry, destroying antitank and antiaircraft missile systems supplied to Ukraine by the United States and the European Union.**  
**The Ukrainian government has poured troops and resources into its effort to hold on to Sievierodonetsk, a strategically important industrial city and the last major urban center in the Donbas region of Luhansk that has not yet fallen. Russian forces have destroyed two bridges leading to the center of Sievierodonetsk and were shelling the remaining one, an important supply line for Ukrainian forces, the regional governor said.**  
Now, the battle may be about to shift to its sister city, Lysychansk.  
On Sunday, from atop a hill in Lysychansk, it was evident why the soon to be focal point of the Russian offensive appears easier to defend than other parts of Donbas: It is on high ground. The sprawling plains of the region are rich in natural resources, but elevation is a rarity.  
**But it’s impossible to defend Lysychansk, a city with a prewar population of roughly 100,000, without the supplies needed to keep Ukrainian tanks and artillery stocked with shells and the thousands of troops garrisoned there fed and equipped.**  
**This is the challenge the Ukrainian military is facing now as Russian forces near the end of their campaign to seize neighboring Sievierodonetsk. Even with Sievierodonetsk captured, Ukrainian troops could most likely defend Lysychansk, in part because the Seversky Donets River separates the two cities — unless Russian forces succeed in severing the city’s supply routes.**  
It was clear Sunday that the Russians were attempting to accomplish just that by steadily advancing from the southeast.  
Plumes of smoke and burning fields where artillery strikes had lit the ground on fire enveloped Lysychansk in a semicircle on Sunday afternoon. The frequent thuds of incoming and outgoing fire echoed across the city as civilians dragged empty bottles to fill up from a fire department water tanker jury-rigged with clean-water filters.  
Last week, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said that “in many ways, the fate of our Donbas is being decided” around Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk. But the first city is now virtually encircled, and if Russian forces continue to advance toward the mix of asphalt and bumpy field roads that serve as the only logistics pipeline into the second, Ukrainian officials will have to make a strategic decision: withdraw or risk an encirclement of Lysychansk, too.  
“We’re waiting for reinforcements,” said Mr. Voronenko, the military police officer, as a group of 20 or so residents began moving toward evacuation vans. “It has partly arrived in the last several days in the form of artillery. And if we get more, then we can probably hold them off.”  
**But nearly four months after Russia invaded, the Ukrainian military is running low on ammunition for its Soviet-era artillery and is not receiving enough ammunition, fast enough, leaving the fate of Lysychansk even more uncertain.**  
For European countries, the question of how to defend Ukraine now is both tactical and political — and raises issues closer to home.

**Several E.U. members are fretting that they have sent too much of their own ammunition to Ukraine and are lagging behind in restocking their arsenals. With the bloc’s foreign policy and defense not integrated, European leaders have been forced to try source their own military supplies.**

European Union officials say they will try to tap a nine billion euro ($9.5 billion) funding pot to jointly procure military equipment,  trying to ease concerns that supporting Ukraine militarily has dangerously weakened defense capabilities elsewhere in Europe.  
  
The bloc is also wrestling with the broader and politically fraught question of how to move forward with Ukraine’s bid to enter the European Union. That decision could bolster Mr. Zelensky at home and perhaps give him more political flexibility to negotiate a cease-fire, but could also lead Russia to dig in or worse.  
  
In a visit to Kyiv Saturday, president Ursula von der Leyen of the European Commission said her administration would provide an opinion on whether the bloc should grant candidate status to Ukraine by the end of the week. Ultimately, however, the decision is a deeply political one that E.U. leaders will be called to answer at a summit June 23 and 24 in Brussels.  
  
For most countries granted candidate status, it takes more than a decade of reforms and negotiations to become a full E.U. member.  
  
Should Ukraine be given a green light, its road forward will most likely be difficult, considering the nation’s dire situation since the onset of war and the poor governance and corruption that marked it even before the invasion.

“Whatever the territorial reality on the ground, having that deepening prospect of Euro-Atlantic integration for Ukraine is very meaningful,” said Mr. Lesser of the German Marshall Fund. “And to the extent that it fosters a growing prospect of an increasingly Westernized Ukraine versus a Russia that’s drifted out into an Asiatic imperial posture, the political contrast between these two actors will become more stark.”",988c914f46b945ee2af13a2c94f71fef1e59f10a,True,False,,,,,0,1655123586,,0,{},ic738ym,False,t3_vbajcy,False,True,t3_vbajcy,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/vbajcy/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_13_2022/ic738ym/,1655123603,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1655094786.0

[],False,,robothistorian,,,[],,,,text,t2_2inubrvw,False,False,"So there are two points to consider in this report. To Indian watchers, this is not new. Like the article points out many of the pieces of the puzzle were already in place. But what is relatively new - something that the authors of that International Security article elide (and it's deliberate since both know better) is that since the mid-2000s, there was a subtle shift in India's defence posture. This shift involved a reassessment of Indian strategic threats and priorities. This involved among other things, the Indian strategic and defence establishment to focus on the PRC as it's primary threat. Pakistan was relegated to the ranks of a secondary threat.

This has had an impact on how India repositioned itself and began the process (which continues till date) to reposition itself vis-a-vis the PRC. Now, some would argue that India continues to focus on the Army (after all, it has a large armoured assets, it has a large ground formations, and the army gets a significant % of the defence budget). All this is true. However, one needs to look at the parallel developments underway. For example, the increased range of their missiles, the MIRV capability, the Anti-Sat capability, the designa Nd fielding of SSBNs (and prospectively of SSNs), the development of the Karwar naval base, the development of the ANC command, the acquisition of long range maritime surveillance platforms, the redesigning of forces (especially it's mountain warfare forces) into integrated combat groups, it's development of military infrastructure along its northern and eastern borders etc. These all suggest that India now has decisely broken with the Pak-centric focus that was the hallmark of its strategic posture. 

This being given, there is, however, a class of ""think tankers"" in India who have not been able to understand (or perhaps more to the point accept) this shift. It is also true in the case of many western commentators who have been used to considering India in a hypenated form with Pakistan. This article is an example of that. It's that old and by now weary narrative of the South Asian ""nuclear flashpoint""! The fact is that for India, Pakistan is a tactical nuisance. For Pakistan, India is likely a strategic threat. This is not the recipe for a nuclear flashpoint. If that was so, then the lady major war between these two countries (the Kargil War) would have shown evidence of that. But what we got was a show of extreme restraint by India (at times even at a cost to its own forces) and a handling of the ground situation with conventional forces (and considerable diplomatic agility in which the US played a major role).

Thus, I argue that the developments that this article.points to purely PRC-focused and nothing else.",061b9713f4785f30c14f69c9471e03535e80fe8a,True,False,,,,,0,1655123165,,0,{},ic72j9c,False,t3_vb48kf,False,True,t3_vb48kf,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/vb48kf/indias_nuclear_arsenal_takes_a_big_step_forward/ic72j9c/,1655123179,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1655094365.0

The Jerusalem Post - By NEVILLE TELLER, JUNE 12

[https://www.jpost.com/international/article-709243](https://www.jpost.com/international/article-709243) 

*The writer is Middle East correspondent for Eurasia Review. His latest book is Trump and the Holy Land: 2016-2020. Follow him at www.a-mid-east-journal.blogspot.com*

*If Russia’s support weakens, Assad cannot cozy up too closely to Iran even though, as an adherent to the Shi’ite tradition of Islam, he has long been its clien*t.

On June 2, the Dubai-based media outlet Al-Arabiya News highlighted the irony of how Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has impacted the Middle East. Citing reports that Russian troops were being withdrawn from Syria to augment forces in Ukraine, the article maintained that further Russian retreats will likely follow, “paving the way for Iran to wield complete influence over Syria.”  
  
“No one,” it writes, “could have guessed that Iran would gain the most from the Ukraine crisis.”  
  
Al-Arabiya News favors Russia’s presence in Syria, not so much for sustaining in power Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, as for restricting Iran’s military expansion. Russia’s ambitions in the region, it maintains, were not too grand: to improve its trade and investment balance, use the port of Tartus and play a significant role in the Middle East.

“Today, this theoretical foreign balance in Syria is about to be tipped in favor of Tehran... The withdrawal of Russia coupled with the continued military presence of Iran could rekindle the flames of conflict inside and around Syria, as the objectives of Iran’s presence in Damascus go far beyond protecting the Syrian regime.”  
  
The Moscow Times is Russia’s leading independent media outlet. In March 2022, following a new law in Russia restricting media coverage of the invasion of Ukraine, it moved its main editors to Amsterdam. A few weeks later, the authorities blocked access within Russia to its Russian-language website. Nevertheless, it continues to publish.

On May 6, The Moscow Times reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin was downsizing Russian military involvement in Syria in order to strengthen his Ukrainian operations. The news outlet maintained that Russia had already begun the process of withdrawing a proportion of its 63,000 troops stationed in Syria and was concentrating them at three airports before transferring them to the Ukrainian front.  
  
The troops being redeployed included the notorious mercenary Wagner Group. Abandoned Russian air bases were being handed over to Iran’s IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps) and Lebanon’s terrorist Hezbollah.  
  
Two days later, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was in Iran. Some commentators believe al-Assad went specifically to ask for increased Iranian support to make good any Russian scale-back in Syria. Assad is well-aware that it was only Putin’s intervention in the Syrian conflict in September 2015 that enabled him to defeat his opponents and retain power.

**Assad's dilemma**  
YET, ASSAD is in something of a dilemma. If Russia’s support weakens, he cannot cozy up too closely to Iran even though, as an adherent to the Shi’ite tradition of Islam, he has long been its client. Assad wants to be readmitted to the Arab League and he needs Arab support to succeed. Any substantial strengthening of Iran’s position in Syria would undoubtedly affect Syria’s relations with other Arab countries, most of whom regard Iran and its regional ambitions with suspicion.  
  
This political reality was made crystal clear by Jordan’s King Abdullah, on May 18. Visiting Stanford University in the United States, Abdullah maintained that the Russian presence in southern Syria was a stabilizing factor and that if it withdrew, the void would be filled by Iran and its proxies, posing a real threat to Jordan’s stability. He added that ever since Moscow has been distracted by the Ukraine war, his country has been facing the possibility of conflict on its border with Syria.  
  
Abdullah was referring to reports that Iran was already taking advantage of Russia’s preoccupation with the war in Ukraine to expand into south and central Syria. Iran’s presence in southern Syria represents a real threat to Jordan. Abdullah has long-warned about Iran’s ultimate ambitions in the Middle East. The Jordanian army is currently mobilizing along the border with Syria to combat drug and arms trafficking. In January, Jordan announced that in future, it will, if necessary, pursue smugglers across the border and apprehend them inside Syria.  
  
Russia has invested heavily in Syria, partly to ensure its continued access to the Mediterranean by way of the port of Tartus, and Putin would not withdraw fully except under extreme pressure. The extent of his continued presence in Syria depends on how successful his military operation is in Ukraine. If he needs to augment his fighting force there, then he will draw even more heavily on his troops currently stationed in Syria, and the shift in the balance of power would quickly become evident. The Assad regime would undoubtedly turn to Iran and its IRGC to maintain control, and to continue fighting the opposition and extremist Sunni groups.  
  
Russia and Iran, although nominally in alliance in Syria, were far from agreeing on such issues as Syria’s political future, its postwar reconstruction, and future economic, political and military policies. Iran could find itself with considerably increased powers in Syria, both military and political. Any significant increase in Iranian troop levels or military activity in Syria would probably attract further Israeli strikes.  
  
So, the political equation turns out to be: Russian failure in Ukraine equals a strengthened Iran in Syria, and a more powerful Iran probably equals increased anti-Iranian military activity by Israel. Democratic interests in the Middle East find themselves condemning Putin’s Ukrainian adventure but fearing lack of success in that operation would boost the Iranian regime’s power base in the Middle East. This is the unexpected and uncomfortable by-product of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.",79d84aa7050a6968b6c3a7504690e4171acd2ec4,True,False,,,,,0,1655109471,,0,{},ic6l12e,False,t3_vakgxc,False,True,t3_vakgxc,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/vakgxc/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_12_2022/ic6l12e/,1655109485,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1655080671.0

In order to match qualitatively, you need at least 9 times superiority in accuracy or rate of fire, and perhaps 9 times larger ammunition stockpile.

Can he arrest or murder everyone in the UA govt or military who starts talking to the press about failures in Donbas relating to logistical issues, specifically shortcomings in artillery? Can he arrest or murder the journalists themselves? 

Occam's Razor. Zelensky's govt can't keep this a secret. Nor is it their job to keep it a secret, they're a democratic govt in a country trying to align with the West, Zelensky isn't Putin and Ukraine isn't Russia. State secrets only go so far. Zelensky's job is to try to fix the situation. Which is actually helped by being honest, killing two birds with one stone. 

More so, Zelensky maintains the trust and confidence of his Ukraine base by being upfront with them, who can agree that artillery shortcomings aren't his fault. All while putting INTENSE media pressure on Western countries to step up to fix their firepower shortcomings to contribute more or else they take the blame for Ukraine casualties, which is obviously the narrative they're pushing. 

Like you said it, and why this sub hasn't stopped discussing it for most of a week now, Ukraine keeps harping on casualties and fires/weaponry inequality in the Donbas. Why? They can't keep it a secret so they're going to try to take advantage of it politically. After all, if this is a proxy war and the Ukrainians are getting their asses kicked due to lack of support, aren't the patrons of the proxy really to blame? Because that sure as shit seems to be the narrative.

Which I think is probably why Biden took [a public shit on Zelensky the other day](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-11/biden-says-zelenskiy-brushed-off-warnings-of-russia-s-invasion).

&gt; * The Agni-P is India’s first shorter-range missile to incorporate technologies now found in the newer Agni-IV and -V ballistic missiles, including more advanced rocket motors, propellants, avionics, and navigation systems.

&gt; * But widespread canisterization with fully armed missiles would shorten warning time. This would likely cause Pakistan to increase the readiness of its missiles as well and shorten its launch procedures––steps that could increase crisis instability and potentially raise the likelihood of nuclear use in a regional crisis.

&gt; *  The increased readiness and pursuit of MIRV capability for India’s strategic forces could further complicate India’s adherence to its NFU policy and could potentially cause India’s nuclear adversaries to doubt its NFU policy altogether.

The Ukrainians have launched multiple spoiling attacks against the western flank of the Russian Izyum axis in the past trying to force the Russians to commit forces to defend there instead of sectors of the salient. The Russians previously didn't bite hard, if at all, and that wasn't evidence then that they didn't have a reserve to commit, only that they recognized it as a spoiling attack. 

It's likely the same scenario now. What can UAF commit to that attack? At most a full brigade? Two? They can't do anything significant with that. So why are they doing it? What's their motivation? Once that's understood, then it's easy to counter it by not doing what they want. Which in this case means not rushing to stop a fruitless counterattack that doesn't change anything.

Let's try to stay grounded in reality. Doing spoiling attacks is needed, it's better to attack Russian weak spots then strong. And even if the Russians don't rush large numbers of troops they still have to commit something to stop it or slow it down, if nothing else diverting arty and drone coverage from more important sectors to what was a quiet sector of the operational area.

[],False,,throwdemawaaay,,,[],,,,text,t2_xzr44,False,False,"&gt;You're missing the point that the main issue of Kessler syndrome is near microscopic specks of paint and such.

I am in fact not. One of the things that helps here is that potential damage is proportional to potential energy. Likewise potential cost of cleanup. Dust to small particles are in fact the easy case. They'll do the least damage in a chain event, they'll deorbit the fastest, they'll be the most easy to push, ablate, drag or tug via electromagnetic tether, etc. Atop that, there's mitigation strategies such as disaggregation into formations vs single buses, that can have rather dramatic influence on the probability of collision.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The part of orbits are true, there will always be ""clean"" orbits such as 3 out of 5 lagrangian's

LMFAO. No, you do not need to go nearly as far as the Lagrange points to retain orbital capability. There is a LOT OF SPACE IN MEO. There is no conceivable universe where someone on earth launches enough mass to push safe orbits out to the Lagrange points. That's hilariously off the mark. You might as well claim you're going to mine the pacific by filling it full of hand grenades.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;We've most likely reached the beginning of Kessler syndrome anyways, based on both the increase in sat-sat collisions, debree collisions on telescopes and other large infrastructure such as the ISS. Plenty of statistical analysis have been published indicating this very thing. Also, Kessler's original paper literally proved that we had already entered the Kessler Syndrome.

This is an incredibly dishonest characterization. Kessler is not an unbounded chain reaction. It's dependent on the probability of interaction, the cross section, just like nuclear physics. Except the particle trajectories involved are constrained by orbital delta v, and the total mass as well as particle count launched in orbit is spread out over fucking SPACE bruh. Ever done a monte carlo path tracing sim? It's not this ""nuclear like chain reaction of doom"" like you're assuming. You've grossly 

misunderstood the qualifications on the napkin math you've read.

&gt;AFAIK, Kofman never questioned that figure

He has questioned what that figure represents. He's stated more directly that he thinks the 190,000 figure represents all the army personnel assembled for the invasion, including logistics and maintenance personnel that never crossed the Ukrainian border. I've heard him say as much in a podcast, but can't find it atm. However in this [joint discussion](https://warontherocks.com/2022/05/what-the-experts-got-wrong-and-right-about-russian-military-power/) he does say at 13:50 that the invasion ""involved"" almost 200,000 personnel and at 37:30 that Russia ""went in"" with around 100,000 troops in battalion sized combat units.

The 80,000 figure he cites in the article with Lee explicitly doesn't include ""auxiliaries and other supporting elements"", which means there were around 20,000 LPR/DPR troops, Rossguardia, etc on Feb 24th for the total of 100,000 he then gives as the ""total force size"". That matches up with the number he gives during the roundtable. As you note in the May 16th twitter thread he allows for a total force of up to 115,000, but seeing as he's stopped citing the larger figures in more recent interviews I've taken to discounting it. Either way he assumes Russia only added just 10,000-12,000 troops in the second phase so we end up with a final size of \~110,000-130,000, which I split the middle on for a total of 120,000.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This appears to be (1) either a significant undercount and/or (2) Russia has substantially reinforced within the last month.

Well, I can't really argue with you if you don't believe the sources I provide. Like I said, intelligent minds can disagree.

I will say that it's a really bad idea to start mixing and mashing sources, like adding Danylyuk's estimate of Russian reinforcements in the second phase to Kofman's estimate of Russian forces in the initial invasion. Kofman's numbers of total troops and casualties are much smaller than many other analysts, although the ratios are often worse for the Russians.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Per Ukraine and other sources, Russia is currently massing 40 reserve BTGs to be sent to Ukraine. 

OSINT sources put the number at 30-40 BTGs, so you're using the upper bound here. With 30-40 BTGs, and the 400-600 personnel Kofman and Lee estimates might be the going average in a BTG these days, that could amount anywhere from 24,000 to just 9,000 new soldiers. Russia has had all of three weeks to gather this together so I wouldn't expect something near the high end. So yeah, I still feel pretty good about my estimate of mid-July although I don't hold myself out as some sort of expert.

&gt;Let's assume, generously, that 1/3 are irrecoverable. Russia would still have 35,400 available returnees to allocate back to the front over the coming weeks.

1/3 might be generous in the other direction. In WW2 only half of soldiers were able to return to combat, and that was for often highly motivated ones. We've had reports of up to 40% of some Russian units refusing to fight after rotating off the line, I hesitate to think that a significant percentage of wounded Russian troops won't decide to take their pay and go after being ripped up by shrapnel even if they could technically return to service.

Also the three month return to service figure you're citing is an average. Every person heals at their own pace. A significant portion of those wounded have already recovered and returned to their units. Within a few weeks it will have amounted to about half of the ones that will be able to return, so just 17,700 by your numbers. The rest will take weeks or months longer. It's more of a slow trickle that has been going on since the war started than a sudden flood, probably just a few dozen a day. Unless Russia has been purposely holding back tens of thousands of troops to form entirely new units, which by all accounts they haven't, it won't give the sort of sudden increase in manpower needed for a offensive.",2ac9514327be0cfccbfcf765a00128ecd03de911,True,False,,,,,0,1655081863,,0,{},ic5ghnk,False,t3_vakgxc,False,True,t1_ic4ib7m,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/vakgxc/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_12_2022/ic5ghnk/,1655081879,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1655053063.0
