[],False,,rocket42236,,,,,,"First off I think the Russian invasion has reminded all of us in the west, that freedom is not free. And that “ The tree of liberty Must be refreshed with the blood of patriots from time to time “all of us in the west are doing our part to help Ukraine by paying for higher prices for everything, That’s us doing our part. all the cheap gas in the world is not worth living in a world controlled by Vladimir Putin And his criminal kleptocracy.  Russia brought war to Europe for the third time in the last 100 years. For all the same reasons. Europeans embraced a new vision for their continent where they would put aside their political differences and create institutions where they could resolve their differences peacefully and politically instead of militarily. Europe has evolved. Russia was offered a chance in the 90s to join with Europe and be a part of the EU and yes even nato membership. Unfortunately Russia has not evolved but actually devolved culturally and politically. No one in the west wanted this war. The Russian people for the last 30 years have had the natural resources, and the potential economic output of a global giant taken from them by corruption and Russian mafia. The current oligarchs are no different than the princes and nobles that ruled over the Russian empire under feudalism, a 13th century concept that they continue to utilize through today.  Unfortunately this war will not end Until the people of Russia decide it’s over. Now if Russia wants to Threaten the use of nuclear weapons, they’re not the only state that has nuclear weapons. The UK, France, India, Pakistan, China, Israel, soon iran will have nukes. None of those powers have actually ever use a nuclear weapon, and gone through a political discourse domestically to justify the use of WMD. There’s one country whom in general the policy is That a WMD is a WMD, it doesn’t matter if it’s chemical biological or radiological. And once an aggressor country uses a WMD then all options are on the table. Not to mention that in today’s Global climate, any country that uses a wmd As a first strike weapon will be will become a global pariah. Russia would be ostracized for generations. The West would respond instantly Without hesitation and without mercy to defend humanity. Russia uses the threat of nukes to expose and bully western leaders.  It’s an empty threat. They have been threatening the use of nuclear weapons for various things over the last two months that the west has gone ahead and done anyway, and the Russians just back down. Besides considering the corruption in the state of the Russian military, there is actually a lot of  Doubt if the Russian nukes even work at all.  And as for some of the politics, if people think the Democrats are not doing the right thing the Republican response is to invade and regime change. Republican presidents have invaded more countries than democratic presidents. Now as to all of the NATO members that used to be part of the Warsaw Pact, they have been trained and integrated with western military’s for the last 30 years, but they have an advantage because they also understand Soviet/Russian military thinking and strategies. The also have Been trained up on all their equipment. To this day the largest foreign arm supplier to UKRAINE is still Russia, and Ukraine can utilize this equipment because they built it. The eastern bloc militaries itching to exact payback on the Russians for the last 300 years of Russian oppression of Eastern Europe. The Polish army of today its not the Polish army of 10 years ago, in general the poles are some other fiercest most competent fighters in the eastern bloc. They have a history of military brilliance. It’s only when all of their neighbors gang up on them at once and no one comes to their aid That they have suffered their greatest losses.  That is not the scenario of today. Honestly the west is itching for an excuse to decimate and end the existence of the Russian military. One thing that Russia has done by demonstrating that it is a threat to the way of life that people live in the rest Europe and around the world, Is that no matter how hard you try to resolve your differences peacefully and negotiate, sometimes the other party does not want to negotiate and they only want to dominate. And now that’s the situation we’re in now. The only language Russia understands today is the language of violence and war. This is a just and right cause and the people in the west know it. The people in the west know that if UKRAINE loses, Europe will be next. China will take Taiwan, And force the rest of Asia to Bend to its will.  China will trap Africa/central and South America in debt and use that debt to control and dominate those continents. So Russia will not use an nuke Or anything that would risk an equivalent response in the west. Because the use of a WMD would not trigger a controlled and proportional response, but an instant and overwhelming response.  There would be no rushed meetings and disagreements and the west.  It would be a all weapons are free signal for the west to step in. Deep down the Russians know this and that’s why they never use it.",355f4d8210b58538c4732d8865cf3413f68b64d9,True,False,,,,,0,1655147024,,0,{},ic8j747,False,t3_vahyqy,False,False,t3_vahyqy,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/vahyqy/is_putin_serious_about_threatening_poland/ic8j747/,1655147042,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1655118224.0,[],text,t2_1f3dt9lj,False,False

&gt; Russia has killed hundreds of civilians in the north-eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv using indiscriminate shelling and widely-banned cluster munitions, according to new research by Amnesty International.

&gt; Cluster munitions are controversial because they detonate in the air and release a cluster of smaller bombs which fall indiscriminately over a wide area, potentially putting civilians at risk.

&gt; At the site of one apparent cluster munition strike in Kharkiv, around a housing estate and playground in the Industrialnyi neighbourhood, the spalling effect was visible around three separate impacts on three sides of a playground.

The U.S. is providing far and away the most support to Ukraine.  The U.S. elections this fall will be a bloodbath for democrats and republicans are going to take both houses of congress--probably by a lot.  The popularity of supporting Ukraine is, at best, mixed among Republican voters.  They literally have an ""America First"" platform and after being voted in to combat massive inflation, sending billions in aid to Ukraine is not going to be popular.  

This is particularly true because ***there is nothing anyone can do about inflation right now***.  It's word-wide.  It's driven by fuel costs, COVID hangover, and--most critically--the world wide retirement of the largest workforce in world history (boomers) that is driving up labor costs as companies struggle to replace lost workers and driving up capital costs as boomers pivot from investing to withdrawing.  No political party can solve that problem and that's why it's literally happening ***EVERYWHERE***.

So how are Republicans going to deliver to their voters?  They can't actually fix the problem and Republican policies (anti-immigration) actually exacerbate the generational problems.  They're going to very publicly stop sending money to other countries--including Ukraine.  You're about to see a full scale withdrawal of the U.S. from the international scene.

[],False,,LizardChaser,,,,,,"I'm going to preface this comment by saying:  ""I don't know.""  That being said, I wondered the same thing and did not find any persuasive arguments until I ran into the arguments from Peter Zeihan.  Zeihan is a geopolitics expert who predicted the invasion at least 5 years ago and potentially 10 years ago.  

(Proof:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkuhWA9GdCo (three min video from 2017))

Long story short, Zeihan's argument is that Russia knows it cannot defend itself with the population that it has (and will have for the foreseeable future) and knows that it's best chance is to expand to natural barriers to limit invading forces to 9 key ""gaps.""  Russia's defensive strategy for 100's of years is to control these ""gaps.""  If you look at Russia's invasions and quasi invasions over the past 20 years they miraculously line up with these gaps:   Kazakhstan, Armenia, Georgia, Moldova, Belarus, and now Ukraine.  

Ok, but they haven't had control for decades so why now?  Zeihan has an argument for that too:  it's now or never for Russia.  Their population is cratering.  Their demographics are upside down.  If they didn't do it now, they wouldn't have a military aged population large enough to do it later--and not again for generations.  Ok, but Europe isn't a threat to invade.  This is probably the weakest point of Zeihan's argument, but his explanation is basically that Russia's view is that Europe isn't a threat ***right now*** but no one can know what 10 years will bring, let alone 50.  If this is Russia's last chance to close the gaps, it doesn't matter if there is a current threat or not because Russia won't have the ability to do it later.  Russia's view is that their only chance for safety with their population decline is to control the gaps so they can focus their defense.  

So, TLDR, yes Russia is serious.  They also know they can't beat NATO conventionally and that doesn't matter to them.  If you accept that Russia has to continue to Poland (or at least Lithuania), then you accept that Russia will use nuclear weapons.  Russia is going to try to see if the west is bluffing that they'll go to nuclear war over Lituania or western Poland.  It's a game with only losing hands.  Unless . . .

. . . Russia never makes it to Poland.  Zeihan's further argument is that this is the last army that Russia will be able to raise for generations and that army must die in Ukraine so that it cannot make it to NATO.

You can't do without food and water.  You can do without higher quality food and beverages but your people may revolt.

You're really amazingly poor at arguing.

&gt; BERLIN — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will travel to Kyiv this month alongside French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, according to tabloid Bild am Sonntag.
&gt; 
&gt; The trip to the Ukrainian capital is likely to take place before a summit of G7 leaders at Schloss Elmau in the Bavarian Alps scheduled to start on June 26, according to the report.
&gt;
&gt; While many world leaders have already made the trip to Kyiv, including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Scholz has so far not travelled there. He had previously said the Ukrainian government’s decision not to welcome German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier meant he wouldn’t go himself.
&gt;
&gt; “That the president of the Federal Republic of Germany … has been disinvited, stands in the way of the matter,” Scholz said in May of his own plans to make a visit. A trip to the Ukrainian capital “must be about making concrete progress, and not just a photo opportunity,” Scholz said at another point last month.

The truth is that Russia has been winning and will win this war in a BIG way. 

Ukie forces are getting routed. Already a huge proportion of the East is now permanently under Russian control and won't be coming back. Zelensky, if he is quick, could surrender The East but he will have to include the southern ports including Odessa.

Even Sleepy Joe is now trying to throw Zelensky under the bus. From promises of chasing Russia out of Ukraine and the Crimea back to Moscow, NATO is now suddenly interested in ""negotiating a peace"". LOL.

Only problem is that Putin is now in the driving seat and it's a little late to appeal to his mercy.

As Josep Borrell, the EU envoy insisted ""this will be settled on the battlefield"" and, as the Russinas said ""Cool, come at me bro"". LOL

A Russian court on Tuesday ordered the arrest in absentia of science fiction writer Dmitry Glukhovsky, who faces up to 10 years in prison for criticism of Moscow's military campaign in Ukraine.

The 42-year-old, who is believed to be abroad, has spoken out against the offensive in posts on social media and opinion pieces for Western media.

Glukhovsky said Tuesday he was being accused of discrediting the Russian army on Instagram and blaming President Vladimir Putin for the offensive in Ukraine.

""I am being accused of discrediting the Russian Armed Forces for a post on Instagram,"" he said on messaging app Telegram. 

""I am ready to repeat everything that was said there: 'Stop the war! Admit that this is a war against the entire nation and stop it!""

The Interior Ministry put the author of Metro 2033, a 2002 post-apocalyptic fiction novel, on a wanted list.

Moscow's Basmanny district court ordered Glukhovsky's arrest in absentia.

Russia is seeing an unprecedented crackdown on the opposition and dissenting voices.

Authorities have introduced a law that imposes a sentence of up to 15 years in prison for publishing information about the military deemed false by the government.

Tens of thousands of Russians have left the country since the start of Moscow's military campaign in Ukraine.

Three months is twelve weeks bro - that’s not much time to capture and hold heavily fortified positions. Total ground captured is approximately the size of England and Wales and the Ukie army has been hammered during that time.

Oh the Javelins and NLAWs have been ineffective.  Riiiiight.  Well that accounts for Ukrainians naming their kids after them...an artist creating a saint holding one, their asking for more faster, our increasing production of them, and all the videos showing your turrets flying into the air along with Russian body parts.  Someone pass me that popcorn.  

Chased out of Kabul.  Your stooge Trump made that Art of the Deal.  But since they all immediately surrendered it is best we did.  No reasons for our people to be in harms way when they won't fight.  And you've forgotten their defeat of you ended your little empire that your little leader is trying to rebuild.  Shall we talk troop losses in Afghanistan cause they killed more of you in far less time and they're on your border.  Your military can't do the logistics as well as our private shippers and Amazon can which was proven in Afghanistan and in Ukraine. 

That next paragraph needs to be run through the Russian translator again.  ""going from strengthen to strength signing deals?"" WTF is that.  I ready covered Afghanistan...reread it.  

Polls in the US and EU (slightly more reliable than ""Hi e us the answer we want or we send you to a gulag"" Russian polls) have shown large majorities are willing to suffer some to hurt you.  The Europeans are far more pissed than the US is because they have to live with Russian trash next door...only about 800,000 Americans have to deal with that.  You're hated in every border and now people are willing to suffer to see you suffer.  That's the kinda unity only stupid Putin supporters could generate.  And sure we're all so used to living well that it may strain things...but not as long as Ukraine is fighting you.   

Sweden and Finland are in the club whether formally in NATO or not.  We have warships in the region (not at the bottom of the ocean or needing a tug boat to accompany it...lol....Russian navy....lol....) and would join either of them if you attacked them.  So in NATO or not, they've made their choice clear.  Their neutrality is no more (though their joint exercises with NATO made it pretty clear all along which side they'd be on).  So your neighbors Norway, Finland, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekhistan, Afghanistan, Japan, South Korea and oh Canada and little old us all despise you.  Did I leave anyone out?  You need to be at the ready on every border you have and with 145 million drunken untrained fools that is hard to do.  And how have we had any losses?  We are not at war.  We're just doing a special military operation to test our weapons.  And supplying Ukraine with the equivalent to about 3% of our annual defense budget in aid.  I'm sure more is coming and let's hope the Ukrainians don't do anything crazy with those longer range missles.  Last time we did the lend lease program we sent you supplies (second only to the British empire) or you'd be ash.  20 million approximately dead to Nazis so you feckless fucks call that a victory and scare your own people shitless into believing that Ukrainians are Nazis.

Bad faith actor is bad faith actor. Trump dictated the exact day that US needed to leave Kabul, which now you state it's ""chased out of"".

Hardly. Its like I have told 3 months ago: A Russian win should be a given.

Thanks for clearing all of this. Again.

Now, I am not saying this from the position where Russians are in Kyiv. But from the position where they were routed out of Kyiv, routed out of Kharkiv, and are seeing advances into Kherson.

Nothing changed from my argument three months ago. Your argument kept changing into whatever telegram copium needed to make the Rusfags less useless.

Russia is not an expert mechanised army. This war proved they are not. They dont even have air superiority against a country with BARELY any working air force. They dont have any combined arms doctrine, and the only advances they can get are done with a massive own death toll.

[],False,,Robert_Kowalski,,,,,,"“…Working class people pissed…(…)” Sure, where by working, you mean “uneducated”.  Let me explain how they manipulate uneducated people using their ignorance against them in example. One of arguments for Trump supporters is: Trump allowed offshore drilling, Biden didn’t. 

When you go to university, they teach you, most of third world countries live of export of crude materials, like gas, coal etc. Most of richest countries in the world on other hand, don’t export their crude materials at all or little, they rather import them and live of manufacturing goods, high tech industries etc. Reason behind it is, crude materials as they getting depleted gain price. So while poor countries deplete their resources and going to be left with nothing (and go back to riding donkeys since they cannot manufacture anything) once those resources are gone, rich ones live of manufacturing goods, their economy is not dependent on selling crudes, and they hold their reserves to sell them (or use them) at times when they value will be many times fold what it is now. Of course, from time to time, there comes self proclaimed “economic genius” who wants to implement third world country economic model, takes credit for gained revenues of sold crudes, than tries to persuade uneducated suckers what he did was good for them. Mentality of “simple workers” makes them vulnerable to such rhetoric, as you said yourself, they have very little inside on big world politics, while they focused on here and now. Hence, let’s drill and ALL be dandy. We going to be rich,… for now anyway,… till resources last, then who cares. NOW and A LOT OF IT, is ALL that matter. 

Rhetorics pushed BY RUSSIAN TROLLS, are pushed not only on Tweeter, but YouTube, Facebook, virtually any comment platform in existence on Internet, Reddit included. As on Reddit you can be banned they usually are more subtle, only planting ideas, while spreading some smokescreen (as saying: Long live Ukraine) to not get banned. On YouTube they usually resort to more in face methods as artificial crowd, where few trolls each writing unsophisticated barking comments from ten different fake accounts, will try to create impression of massive support for their ideas, hoping they can act on herd instinct of readers. If many people believe in something, than there is probably something to it. AND OMG, all the world, people from dozens of different countries all the sudden thinks as Vladimir Putin, of course,.. EXCEPT [for this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=THDHTlaSb50&amp;t=21&amp;feature=youtu.be). Trolls are mostly fluent in particular language Russians, PAID and INSTRUCTED what to write in general terms, given free hand in details. Lying, fake sources, making up things are all perfectly OK. Typical Russian Troll will claim he is an American, devoted Trump supporter. He will praise him, speak highly of Putin, Merkel, Macron (as smart people), as well plant sources and disinformation carefully and expertly prepared by brain gurus from Russian intelligence. 
What anti immigration in US has to do with Russian interest? Well, for centuries USA was seen from abroad as island of hope and refuge for any poor or oppressed people on the planet. It gain admiration for it. What sweeter than destroying it? Let’s put LOTS of illegals with families, who own houses, businesses for 20,30,40 years in dire distress. Let’s create human drama. In US when all emigration (including illegal) is still small and balanced compared to other countries, trolls fuel anti immigrant sentiments. In Germany, Sweden where it is huge and they calculate it will cause problems, they supporting it. Once you accomplish goal you can claim (unfortunately, not without basis for it anymore), look how hypocritical those countries are! And they blame us, with their fake values?  
Nowadays you don’t need internet to suck Russian propaganda. Fox and Tucker doing it as legitimate American sources. Old days it was more of Alex Jones and similar false flag patriots on radio and TV.

Well done with the Javelins (which have proven to be fairly ineffective) - what you didn’t learn is that actual conflicts with mechanised armies require heavy weaponry which is why Russia is routing the Ukie forces with artillery.

“…Biden definitely his doing”.  Nope Trump did it! It was not Biden who stood to Putin after Russia invaded Ukraine! It was not Biden which met with NATO and Germany AFTER which they announced 180 degree change of their politics! How’s about what Trump REALLY did? Remember how Obama made however imperfect Iran deal which sharply lowered gas prices worldwide, AFTER Crimea annexation? Low gas prices hurt Russian economy DEEPLY. Gas and oil prices and export, [even now](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/amp/2022/04/06/eu-has-spent-35bn-on-russian-energy-and-just-1bn-on-aid-borrell), is what really keeps and runs Putin’s war.

Not to mention, would you be little sharper, you could have guessed by my screen name alone I’m Polish (I do live in US though), where a) Poland lays right between Germany and Russia b) “voiced by Trump concerns” ARE concerns voiced by Polish media and government FOR YEARS, let me guess, LONG before you even heard about them. 
“…American taxpayers footing bill for defense of Europe”.  US is not “good uncle” paying for EU defense as Trump is trying to paint. US is in NATO, for its OWN INTEREST, which is namely, so English NOT Russian is official language in the USA. Would Russia take entire EU, and some part of Middle East, majority of world industrial and crude resources would become theirs, making them THE STRONGEST power in the world, too big and powerful to win with. Those are actually THE VERY SAME REASONS, American troops fought in EU during WW2! Another thing is EU countries could and should have increased their defense spendings, just as they should impose way tougher energy import sanctions now. One thing is DOING something about it, and another TALKING about it, WHILE, undermining strength of alliance in eyes of the enemy, alienating Allies, but most importantly COLLAPSING ALLIANCES under false pretenses by pulling US out of it!!!

Listen carefully what secretary of NATO (and he is Norwegian NOT German) has to say and what is his final argument: “Yes, but together we are still stronger than apart”.",8e257f47e81df7d5bda29ea55de2f2b3719d848c,True,False,,,,,0,1655079866,,0,{},ic5crwn,False,t3_vahyqy,False,True,t1_ic4fqyv,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/vahyqy/is_putin_serious_about_threatening_poland/ic5crwn/,1655079880,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1655051066.0,[],text,t2_gary2ssy,False,False

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.
