The materials needed for EVs will not be in stable supply in the near future due to the complex supply chains needed which are easily disrupted as demonstrated with the chip shortage. Luckily the US has enough rare earth metals to manufacture domestically but large scale mining operations aren’t set up yet. As the US becomes less reliant on China EVs will become cheaper.

The fact that there’s a waiting list for Tesla’s due to scarcity of the resources means EVs are it fully here yet.

[],False,,TrinityAlpsTraverse,,,,,,"In my opinion there's two big issues to watch with EVs-- supply chains and material science advances.

Unfortunately, with current battery technology, the supply chain for EVs is very complex compared to oil, and requires material inputs from a whole host of countries. Absent significant advances in material science that provides a safe, mass produceable battery made out of more abundant materials, widespread production and adoption of EVs relies on relative stability in a whole of countries to get the metals necessary for current battery tech. I'm not that worried about the current Ukraine war, because it seems like metals from Russia are making their way out of the country and into the battery supply chain. The bigger risk was eloquently summarized in another Geopolitics post about the coming food crisis. If we see a global food shortage this fall, a lot of countries will potentially be politically unstable. I could see that instability impacting global metal prices, driving up the price of EVs and greatly slowing the transition away from ICE vehicles. 

The other major development is material science advances in EV batteries. There's a lot of promising ideas in the development pipeline, but it's far too soon to tell if any of them will bare fruit. Without significant advances, the future of EVs has two major issues. The first is the supply chain vulnerability I listed above. The second is that there are currently important use cases that current battery technology just isn't ideal for. To name a few: extreme weather locations, trucking, underdeveloped areas. Crossing my fingers that we get those advances, because I think a better version of EVs would be an incredible advance for humanity.",f20fdf5e3d1d23124053a43382dcf7ad27215db1,True,False,,,,,0,1655154809,,0,{},ic91pmb,False,t3_varkrm,False,True,t3_varkrm,/r/geopolitics/comments/varkrm/how_important_exactly_is_forecasting_electric/ic91pmb/,1655154828,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1655126009.0,[],text,t2_7q6sqy,False,False

We simply don't know how the rules will change when most wealthy countries around the world are shrinking instead of growing.

We can look at Japan, but Japan was aging while other countries were still young. They were able to offset some of their missing young population by moving factories closer to consumers like a lot of the Japanese Auto did in America. 

My personal guess is that we're all vastly underestimating how the demographic crunch will impact countries. Not just China, but Europe and eventually the US as well.

* Their success in contesting the airspace, as well as decimating the Russian Black Sea fleet also don't align with the expected outcome if you go by the numbers. 
* If anything, Russian forces have shown to be less than dynamic. Remember the giant convoy barely moving towards Kiev for weeks. Or the several week long interlude between their retreat from Kiev and the beginning of their assault on the Donbas. If the RAF ""operationally pause"" their assault on the Severodonetsk area, they will likely lose again territory and towns they've captured there at great expense.
* With partisan activity on the rise, Russia's inability to quickly move units and equipment might become even more pronounced.
* We don't know what future weapon shipments will be announced and carried out in the coming days and weeks.

Vietnam and the American Revolutionary War weren't classic insurgencies.  In Vietnam, the US literally lost to a smaller country.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; They are fighting like an army, from fortified positions, against a country with which it shares a landborder. That's a whole different ballgame.

They are fighting a country that chose to invade them and defending their homes.  That gives them an advantage over Russia.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Why not come to a ceasefire and start an actual insurgency campaign, which, we can all agree on, Russia cannot win?

Because it is better in the long-term for Ukraine to have a stable government and functioning economy.  It's preferable to provide arms to a legitimate government than it is an insurgency group.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Nevertheless, the world is going towards a recession and the EU will be destabilised for decades and we will see a populist wave throughout the continent.

Covid policy is what led to the recession.  And Europe will be more destabilized by having Ukraine as a third-world hellhole on its border than it will be by a short war.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That was basically the guaranteed outcome when the Russians invaded. Their economy already is in shambles. Which raises the question what continuing to fight and die in the current way is worth.

Defending their democracy and state is worth it for Ukraine.  They don't want to be a slave state of Russia.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That's a question people like Biden, Macrom, and Schulz are publicly asking already

Biden is fine and hasn't said as much.  Macron and Schulz are defeatist weanies who want to get back to sucking on Russian oil.  Trying to sell out Ukraine as a Russian slave state has nothing to do with war strategy on those two.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;(At the same time the US was/is supplying jihadis with weapons, so why not Ukrainians?)

It's preferable to have a stable government to provide weapons to than armed jihadist groups.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So the alternative is a ceasefire with a Ukraine in economic shambles but not fighting. People will live hard but relatively normal lives where they aren't getting bombed daily or have their relatives and friends die at the front.

They won't in the long-term because they cannot rebuild their economy due to Russia squeezing-off all the profitable bits of the country.  Nor will they be at peace if their government ends up being deposed and descending into civil war after signing such a pathetic surrender.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Again, I don't necessarily disagree with your assessment. But just because that's an emotionally or morally unsatisfying outcome, doesn't mean we have the capability to change that outcome.

We can perhaps wait a year before demanding that Ukraine surrender and be a Russian slave state?  Allow them to fight and provide them with the weapons to do so.

Yes. This is literally how a smaller country wins a war - by making it too painful for the larger force to continue. How do you think that the US lost in Vietnam and Afghanistan and Russia lost in Afghanistan? How do you think that the US won the Revolutionary War?

Ukraine isn't fighting an insurgency war though. They are fighting like an army, from fortified positions, against a country with which it shares a landborder. That's a whole different ballgame. 

&gt;Which means continuing to fight until they do. This will be either a continued hot war or a long insurgency but Ukraine will ultimately win.

But that's my point: Ukraine does not have the equipment to win a hot war. So why are we desperately trying to extend their ability to fight a hot war (but not giving them enough equipment to win such a war)? Why not come to a ceasefire and start an actual insurgency campaign, which, we can all agree on, Russia cannot win? 

&gt;
Actually not. People aren't continuing to flee Ukraine and are even returning to the country. Fighting hasn't spilled onto Poland's borders. What I'm talking about is 20 million+ people fleeing the country because of abject third-world poverty and coups in Poland and the Baltics and the like.

Nevertheless, the world is going towards a recession  and the EU will be destabilised for decades and we will see a populist wave throughout the continent. 

&gt;And I pointed out that this wouldn't happen. How is Ukraine going to have an economy without access to its seaports? It would be a third-world hellhole on Europe's border with no economic development. Not to mention that this will lead to political instability. Zelensky will likely be deposed in a coup the moment that he signs a surrender that gives up Kherson and Mariupol and armed groups will fight over the crumbs like in other third-world countries. There is no way that the EU/ US will be providing weapons to be used in a civil war.

That was basically the guaranteed outcome when the Russians invaded. Their economy already is in shambles. Which raises the question what continuing to fight and die in the current way is worth. That's a question people like Biden, Macrom, and Schulz are publicly asking already. The West sent 8 pieces of mrls systems, they are not providing Ukraine the means to win as it is. They are not interested in or able to provide the support that is needed to win the war as it is. 

(At the same time the US was/is supplying jihadis with weapons, so why not Ukrainians?)

So the alternative is a ceasefire with a Ukraine in economic shambles but not fighting. People will live hard but relatively normal lives where they aren't getting bombed daily or have their relatives and friends die at the front.

&gt;What you are talking about is defeatism - Russia's permanent victory and Ukraine without a country and economy. At the very best, under your scenario, Ukraine will be a third-world failed state without an economy and with massive political instability. In reality, Russia will take advantage of the chaos to gobble up the rest of Ukraine and turn it into a Russian slave state like it wanted to in February. Surrender now means wiping Ukraine off the map as a country.

In the link above, it says Ukraine exports US$ 4.6 Billion of grain. The largest markets are Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Lebanon, Turkey, Morocco, and Tunisia.  All of them aren't affiliated with the West and poor countries/middle countries. The West doesn't care about whether these countries can get their wheat. If the West had any interest in Ukraine before the War it would have bought wheat from Ukraine. 

Egypt makes up to 26% of total wheat purchases. Egypt said it won't buy stolen Ukrainian wheat that Russia was trying to offload.  Indonesia and Pakistan are at 12 and 10%. Since Indonesia only started purchasing Ukrainian wheat 2 years after droughts in Australia, they can easily shift to Australia. For Indonesians is used mainly for noodles, it's not the main staple. Pakistan is a wheat importer, but they are a major rice exporter. Pakistan isn't going to starve because of this. Like Indonesia, Bangladesh is also another rice-eating country. Ukraine's wheat shipments to Bangladesh are about US$500 Million, which is about 1.2% of Bangladesh's export bill.  Even Tunesia, wheat makes up 2.8% of their import bill, of that Ukrainian wheat makes up 35% of that total.

On the other hand, I reckon it's important to point out that while China's position is militarily disadvantageous, that can't be said in the economic realm. Its proximity to the Asian Tigers, the heavily populated Tiger Cub Economies (ASEAN generally), and the populous South Asia (despite restrictions in India) works wonders for their position as a [trade node and a key cog in the Global supply chain](https://i.ibb.co/m5QDqCP/Screenshot-2022-05-29-at-18-04-51-World-Bank-Document-Global-Value-Chain-Development-Report-2019-Tec.png).",09a89dde619efb9e2b2f3bde2164d03d6ae89af1,True,False,,,,,0,1655080901,,0,{},ic5epj3,False,t3_v9vmyw,False,True,t1_ic3k823,/r/geopolitics/comments/v9vmyw/what_do_you_think_will_happen_to_china_in_the/ic5epj3/,1655080919,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1655052101.0,[],text,t2_rr1iy,False,False

[],False,,ParadisePainting,,,,,,"&gt;So far they haven't made the mistake the Americans made in Iraq by conquering the area but then dismissing all of the civil servants and people who can actually run the place.

What does this mean?  The areas you're talking about, e.g. where passports are being issued, etc., are, like you said, where the highest % of Russians and their sympathizers are located.  Leaving some/many/most of those people in civil service positions makes sense.  There were no areas of Iraq with Americans or American sympathizers, period, let alone in any positions of power.  This is not an apt comparison.

[],False,,Greybatclone,,,,,,"Tesla is almost doubling their network yearly.  These also aren't the 60 mile range cars of 2010.  Very few people drive 300 miles on a trip without stopping.  That is almost 5 hours.  People stop every 2-3 hours for 10+ minutes.  More than enough to top off with new chargers.  The federal government is going to dump billions into a network.

Most people also take very few trips and lots of families have 3-5 cars.  They can rather easily switch all but one to EV and have no worries.

When we say ""price parity"" are we talking OTD price or lifetime cost?  Because on lifetime cost it is actually already quote close and many investigations have shown it to be lower.

[],False,,Beginning_Beginning,,,,,,"&gt;Russia is trying to sell stolen Ukrainian grain to poorer countries and the US has told these countries to not accept stolen shipments.

Or what? I read that the US is pressuring 18 countries to not accept wheat shipments, what's it going to do? Put sanctions on them all? You've said it yourself, these countries would be between a rock and a hard place, however, letting populations starve is a fast and simple way to have them riot. They might see how they handle sanctions later, but getting food is the top priority.

Sanctions are progressively less effective after all this unilateral sanctioning frenzy: See how Latín countries reacted towards the US excluding sanctioned countries from the Summit of the Americas; see how countries like Iran and Venezuela are signing long-term cooperation agreements and bypassing dollar-based transactions for alternative systems; see how Iran retaliated against the Greek un the yankee impasse (Greek courts already reverted the decision that allowed the US to gran the Iranian oil; see the number of European countries that gave inter rubble-based payments for Russian energy exports (just for energy, wait until Russian starts charging rubbles for things like neon, titanium or uranium)... More sanctions are simply pushing these countries into the arms of Sino-Russian dominated financial instruments.

If you have any doubts just take a look at what's happening between Turkey an Russia: The latter has opened its market to a huge number of companies that are substititing the ones that left the country at the start of the war, bilateral commerce has tripled and transactions are being negotiated un lyras and rubbles, and now Russia has such leverage that it's even negotiating with Turkey to stop its Northern Syria offensive by debilitating the US-supported YPG-SDF coallition and having the SAA move troops into Manbij. 

Those are all direct - though unintended - consequences of weaponizing the financial system against Russia and going all-in with sanctions. I don't see why anyone would promote further debilitating the Western financial systems by putting more sanctions in place which only alienate locals against the so-called free world.",bd514457769fbe7741bdc69f2b0b59d7d3f781f7,True,False,,,,,0,1655078787,,0,{},ic5ara6,False,t3_vap5nw,False,True,t1_ic4x6gy,/r/geopolitics/comments/vap5nw/wouldnt_it_be_in_ukraines_interest_to_block_grain/ic5ara6/,1655078804,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1655049987.0,[],text,t2_24531htf,False,False
