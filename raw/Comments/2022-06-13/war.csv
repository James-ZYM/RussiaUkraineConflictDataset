He also said that in the coming days the nomenclature of goods that Ukraine will send to Turkmenistan for gas payments will be agreed.  
  
The press secretary of the Ukrainian prime minister stressed that there are no issues with monetary settlements to date, and the issues of commodity supplies are caused by the lack of a clear nomenclature of goods in Turkmenistan.  
According to the concluded agreements, OJSC Gazprom made a partial advance payment for the services of ""Naftogaz Ukrainy"" for the transportation of natural gas during 2005-2009 in the amount of $ 1.25 billion.  
  
NJSC Naftogaz of Ukraine transferred the received advance payment to Vnesheconombank to repay the debt to OJSC Gazprom, the right to claim which had been transferred to Vnesheconombank the day before under agreements with a Russian company. Thus, Ukraine's debt for consumed natural gas of OAO Gazprom has been fully repaid.

1. The results will vary depending in which community you will make a poll. Z enjoyers will be 100% in their supporting of war, while some communities like Lenta or 2ch will give you much less support.

2. Gas from the pipeline aready using, because it is supplied by agreement. If Ukraine needs more gas, then unauthorized sampling of gas from the pipeline to the detriment of European consumers is at least not cultural.

&gt;confirmed the use of the pipeline as blackmail

Wow, Russia is trying to play superpower and use economic and political pressure to achieve her goals. I wonder who they learned from?

&gt;Also selling gas from Turkmenistan to Ukraine

As i know, Ukraine started to buy Turkmenian gas in 1994, but lated supplies stopped due to Ukraine's debt to Turkmenistan. Same story with Russia- Ukraine did not have enough money to pay for gas at the prices that were set by the agreements.

&gt;To me, they are all just savages. Like zoopark

The words of the Russians are about ""theft"". It was said about the use of gas from the pipeline for which there will be payment after the agreement. He was paid for that gas. Moscow disrupted negotiations for pressure. They did not blackmail them. **They began to whine**. The contract was signed in 4 days and everything was paid. **Europe has confirmed the use of the pipeline as blackmail** to address political issues and **use in non-market relations. They were given a latch, but not to twist it.**  
Gazprom has tried to increase gas sales by $ 3 billion to $ 5 billion annually. At the same time, by raising gas prices in Ukraine, the Russian government wanted to capture a part of the Russian metallurgical market, in which Ukrainian companies successfully competed with Russian ones. Also selling gas from Turkmenistan to Ukraine, and with such audacity the negotiations went to the point that Ukraine itself will work directly with Turkmenistan, and Moscow will be only the operator of the GTS. That's why they moan.
