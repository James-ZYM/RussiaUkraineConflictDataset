56,[],False,,sparkreason,,,[],,,,text,t2_4brav,False,False,"NATO in its essence is against peace and sovereignty and I’ll explain in depth why that is.

First let’s debunk the NATO is about sovereignty.   It is not about sovereignty at all because of Article V 

If for example Poland gets into a fight with Finland how the fuck is that Spain’s problem?  Well under Article V if Finland attacks Poland as a response to defend itself Spain has to come to Poland’s defense.  Even if they started it.

These kind of collective defense agreements are exactly what started WWI with the murder of Franz Ferdinand.

Now as to it being against peace.  Just like in high school if you have “clicks” of groups that are exclusionary (NATO) and antagonize other countries (Russia) eventually there will be conflict.  Because by setting up a group specifically designed around isolating another there is the constant application of pressure.

And Ukraine and Georgia are the pushback.  

And it’s sad because NATO countries didn’t really give a shit about Ukraine.  To them Ukraine was just a pawn in the game against Russia. And they will fight Russia to the last Ukrainian at the destruction and cost of Ukraine itself.   That’s not a “friend” that’s exploitation.  

And how long did people think that Russia was going to put up with being pushed around before they lashed back?  Until NATO had missile silos outside of the Kremlin? 

Of course they were going to lash back.  And I’m not saying it is justified.  What I am saying is this is what happens when you push countries into a corner.  It’s not smart to do it.  Nobody likes it and eventually there will be a destructive recourse.

Look at Taiwan.   Now Taiwan believes it is the rightful government of mainland China it is armed and bank rolled by the US.   How do people think China feels about that?  Obviously they are pissed about it.

New Zealand is a very nice and friendly country, but if I armed Tonga with billions in weapons and they believed they are the rightful government of New Zealand how long do you think it would take for New Zealand to be pissed about it?  I would wager not long.   And that’s exactly how easy it is to flip a country that is friendly and nice into an adversarial role.

NATO did exactly that to Russia.  It could have been a friendly and easy going country but it was never allowed to grow in that direction.   Everything NATO did from the moment the USSR fell was to keep pushing and keep pushing and keep pushing until Russia got pissed.  And they were going to get pissed Putin or no Putin every country/person has their limits.  

So really what is the “end game” NATO? It doesn’t have one.  And just like open ended wars like Vietnam or Afghanistan these things go on and on and when they are over people’s response always is… why the fuck did we waste our time and resources on something so pointless without any clear exit strategy or goal.  The same with NATO.

NATO’s whole point was “deter Russian aggression” but all it did was create that self fulfilling prophecy.  Now you got a pissed off aggressive Russia *slow clap* go on go fight them get out the nukes launch them and kill millions.  Oh what’s that? You don’t want to do that? Then what the fuck was the point? And the sad truth is… NATO didn’t have a point after the collapse of the USSR… it just stuck around and expanded long enough until it created its point again.",1341f5c047080b51c58a320b91a110b969209a36,True,False,,,,,0,1655163394,,0,{},ic9knjh,False,t3_vao9kv,False,True,t1_ic8406i,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vao9kv/putin_has_now_made_it_crystal_clear_his_invasion/ic9knjh/,1655163405,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655134594.0,

General Mark Hertling, so I thought it'd be acceptable to post here. With the news about our guys needing 1000 artillery pieces and 500 MLRS, a lot of folks have been wondering why the American administration can't just give Ukraine all that stuff, and this thread is a good explanation. The tl;dr is that long-range missiles and artillery have a HUGE logistical track. Not only do you need to train Ukrainian soldiers how to operate them because even their vets are used to Soviet rather than Western systems, but you ALSO need to train a lot of mechanics and transportation supporters to maintain them and keep them fueled, because the more advanced a piece of artillery is, the more complicated it is to keep functioning. So not only do you have to train the actual cannoneers and missileers from scratch, you also need to train the maintenance techs for these systems because they're so complex and different from older Soviet models. That takes a long time, so even if we shipped all our stuff to Ukraine today, they couldn't really operate it effectively.",b87b112eceeea4b4ac9d4fc5a532244e02c4c655,True,False,,,,,0,1655163352,,0,{},ic9kkdf,True,t3_vbpm7s,False,True,t3_vbpm7s,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vbpm7s/good_thread_from_gen_hertling_on_why_even_america/ic9kkdf/,1655163368,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655134552.0,

Behind all the propaganda, behind all the claims of restoring ""traditional values"" displaced by ""Western decadence"", behind the Nationalism and the hatred, it's all hollow. They might claim to be fighting Nazism, or bringing Russians home to the Motherland, or preventing the encroachment of Anglo-American hegemony, but those are just words. The last is very slightly closer to truth, but only because the idea of neighboring countries pursuing security through an alliance with more powerful states threatens Putin's real agenda.

It's not about ideology. It's all about power. Naked, empty, meaningless power, seized for its own sake through violence and deceit, and held until someone else takes it.

Bro I am actually laughing that your balls to the wall defence of Azov is to throw America under the bus as the War Criminals Par Excellence.

You are a genius. There are very few people who have your clarity of vision to accuse me, for saying 'you can support Ukraine without supporting Azov', of being a Putinite propagandist, while making his own defence 'well the US committed unprecedented war crimes over the years here's an itemised list of all the children they incinerated Azov didn't do that'.

I very genuinely bow down to you for having the most fucked in the head defence of Azov there is. The one defence of Azov nobody wants. The work of an idiot savant lol.

&gt;I didn't say that. That's what you took from the statement

Yeah, your statement of 'Azov aren't Nazis, an Israeli funds them' lol 🤡

&gt;You're not an honest player in this discussion, but I don't think it's deliberate. I think you get a dopamine hit from sc enarios like this and are prepared to sacrifice honesty to maintain it.

Telling on yourself again. My point really couldn't be clearer - you don't have to support Azov to support Ukraine. Open and shut case. It is you jumping through hoops like a dog at a show to showcase your genius at how you fully understand the Azov Theseus Ship.

There are a large number of noisy call-of-duty generals on this sub, and they are almost as annoying as the Russian trolls.

There is an old saying - amateurs talk strategy, professionals talk logistics.

Even if the US flew in a hundred more m777s, Ukraine can't just take hundreds of artillarymen (and maintenence crews) off the front for a few weeks to learn M777s. OTOH the US (and western NATO countries) have no 152mm artillery shells to give. I'll also guess most former Eastern block NATO countries are willing to help but not willing to mostly disarm their own forces to arm Ukraine, and besides maybe Poland they probably don't have big stores of ammo anyway. The good news is the US did ramp up 155mm shell production in 2019 to almost 150,000 shells per year, and has already publicly claimed to have sent 183,000 shells to Ukraine.

I'm not even talking just nazis. I'm talking every military on the planet. Forgetting that Azov Battalion is only 7 years old and has a history about as long as a blink in military terms, let's just pick a random, say US Air Force. Unlike Azov Battalion, they incinerated 100,000 women and children in the Tokyo firebombing. The Marines massacred half of Central America.

I didn't say that. That's what you took from the statement.

Except you have to be intellectually dishonest to say they're a 'shithole'. That's you manufacturing reality, not observing it.

Searching on 'permafrost' didn't make my day better anyway. With potential of new diseases or sinking of pipelines in thawing grounds that means that a lot of methane is going to leak (as an extremely potent greenhouse gas).

The thing closest related to what I was blabbering about was [Russians using the freezing of pipelines as an excuse to not uphold agreements with OPEC](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/world/europe/russia-oil-cut.html). As OPEC wants to balance prices/productions, Russia doesn't want to downscale. Citing the freezing dangers, which western researchers think is unfounded rhetoric to keep production high. Even when being asked by OPEC to decrease.

What are some other militaries who were founded by neo Nazis, then brought in as neo Nazis to a bigger military, then given British and American training in exchange for toning down rhetoric while keeping all their neo-nazi aesthetics?

You talk about strawmen yet your argument or 'Azov have kept all their neo-nazi paraphernalia' is 'you just described every military on the planet' a literally meaningless statement, pure strawmen.

&gt;Straw man.

You: Azov can't be neo-nazis, an Israeli funds them

Me: here is a white supremacist funded by an Israeli. Funding by an Israeli does not mean someone can't be a neo-nazi.

You: strawman.

That is not a strawman. You set up the logical premise that funding by an Israeli inherently disbars someone from being a neo-nazi. I proved that wasn't the case. Your logic is flawed as proven by that - opposite of a strawman.

&gt;You're trying to make moral hills to stand on

I'm saying you can support Ukraine without supporting that shithole of an outfit Azov. That is the opposite of a moral hill becuase it is actually taking out all moral standpoints and removing Azov as a requirement for supporting Ukraine. You're carrying water for that shithole of an outfit Azov by parceling it in with support for Ukraine so it becomes the moral position to accept both.

There is no hill in saying you don't have to make the moral decision on Azov, you can support Ukraine without them. It is you making it a moral hill by explicitly linking any critique of them to Putinite propaganda. Pointing out the big fucking rune they fly in your face is now Putin propaganda? you are setting the prerequisite of denying what is in front of your eyes for a higher goal. THAT is a moral hill.

It's amazing you tell on yourself this bad, that before your own strawman you accuse me of one. Before setting up a moral line accuse me removing any moral decision on Azov as a prerequisite for supporting Ukraine is a moral line. If you had half the brains you think you have you'd be a problem lol.

So first off, not a tankie, not an authoritarian, not pro-Russia, not pro-Putin. Pro Ukraine sovereignty. Not anti-West. Yes anti-certain aspects of America. Very much following the situation in Ukraine on a daily basis. My family has first hand experience with the genocidal shit the Russian military and government does. Story time: My family fled Germany during the Holocaust. Some survived the Nazis. They did not survive the Soviets. I'm not fighting you on being anti-Russia. From my station, all I can and have been able to do is donate what little I do have to Ukraine relief funds. So, why do I bother typing this? The purpose of this isn't to find common ground with you, but to better illustrate that you made up stories in your head, peddle in generalized violent rhetoric, and have since convinced yourself your imagination is reality. I am sure you think Russia is currently communis. You definitely think Russian people are a monolith. I think. You're posts are choppy and interspersed with indecipherable shit. This is what I mean by you making baseless assumptions and churning up word salad. 

 I'm glad you can admit that you are, indeed, losing it, bud. That's the first step to doing better. Anyway, I have no problem stating that I'm a libertarian leftist either.  

None of this changes  the fact that words mean things and you use Tankie incorrectly nor does it change that your posts are like a two year old slammed his fists onto a keyboard. It's the same principle as, since you're mentioning a lot of America, Democrats calling all Republicans Nazis. Nazi has a meaning. While colloquially these words are easy to ascribe because they fit to certain people, they don't fit with everyone. Tankie has a specific meaning. Look up Tankie on Wikipedia. It says it all right there. Using incorrect words makes criticism ineffective when it matters.

As much as I think you're a dipshit representative of all of your closing comment's insults, I will continue giving money when I have it to efforts that might keep you alive, help you, or otherwise fight Russia.


Side note: MLK Jr has nothing to do with this conversation, but yes, he was absolutely on the left. If you cared about that point, you'd actually look into his history before commenting. Again, word salad. Stay on topic.

I myself came from a Spätaussiedler family to Germany in 1992. We had no connections to Germany before nor to Wolga Germans. 
Everyone I know, who are Spätaussiedler aswell, do also have No connections to Wolga Germans.
I'd say that the number of Wolga Germans in the number of Spätaussiedler is quite small. For most we are a mix of polish, ukrainian, russian and belarussian. Also don't trust people saying they come from Kazakhstan. For most they are Russians and you can see they are Russians. They come from early and later stages of russian colonialism of central Asia.

The problem with Spätaussiedler is, that they mostly came because of economic reasons, so did my family.
Even though my grandma is an academic, she rather moved to a foreign country, where her academic degree wasnt verified, so she had to Work in a kitchen. My mother started working in a bakery and now has one her own.
When they came here, they immediately took intensive courses in language, culture, and so on (Intensivsprachkurs/Intensivintegrationskurs) to integrate themselves in Germany. 
But I'd also say that this number is quite small. Cousins of my mother also came to Germany and did Not take any courses and now have major and minor problems with language barriers etc.

&gt;Ukraine has Europe's third-largest shale gas reserves at 1.2 trillion cubic meters 

Own notes: 1.2 trillion proven and 5.6 trillion estimated. Second largest if excluding Russia. Russia has 35-50 trillion. Ukraine has a current production of 0.02 trillion cubic meters and Russia has 0.6 trillion cubic meters. At its height during the soviet era did Ukraine produce 0.06 trillion cubic meters. That would be 10% of Russian production. So you are right. It wont take over all of Russia's production. Though it would diversify. And not all russian productions go to the EU. 

&gt;In 2021, the European Union imported 155 billion (0.115 trillion) cubic metres of natural gas from Russia 

Ukraine would only need to compete with a [yearly export of 0.155 trillion cubic meters](https://www.iea.org/news/how-europe-can-cut-natural-gas-imports-from-russia-significantly-within-a-year). Which would make the estimated export of ukrainian gas in 2030 (0.03 trillion) as per their government plans. Which to be fair would be to be energy self sufficient and not for export. But scaling it with time, investment and developed skills it would be logical to assume Ukraine would export 0.02 trillion by 2040 (probably higher due to foreign investments as the shell investment showed). Which would be at least 1/8th of Russian current exports. Couple that with a lower demand from the EU and lower shale gas prices from the US and it will make a dent. But on its own you are right. It would pose a moderate risk to Russian income. It would mean a 2% decrease of income in Russian exports (1/8th of 23% of Russian budget coming from gas exports). For a bad economy that is not good, but indeed it wouldn't mean a crippling.  

Sadly the invasion of Donbas decreased this potential drastically. So Russia did prevent competition on the gas market. 

&gt;Ukraine signed a 50-year production sharing agreement with Royal Dutch Shell on 25 January 2013 involving the Yuzivska shale gas field. The $10 billion deal was the largest foreign direct investment ever for Ukraine. [...] Ukraine originally expected commercial shale gas extraction to begin in 2017, but Shell pulled out of the project in 2015 as a consequence of the war in the Donbas region.


Though production isn't the only weapon that could be used against Russian exports. The storage of Ukraine could also be a blow to the gas prices. Filling when price is low and selling when price is high. Causing the price to remain lower throughout the year. 

As per [Harvard article](https://hir.harvard.edu/ukraine-energy-reserves/)

&gt;Excluding Russia’s gas reserves in Asia, Ukraine today holds the second biggest known gas reserves in Europe. As of late 2019, known Ukrainian reserves amounted to 1.09 trillion cubic meters of natural gas, second only to Norway’s known resources of 1.53 trillion cubic meters. Yet, these enormous reserves of energy remain largely untapped.

[...]

&gt;Ukraine’s gas transportation system will continue to play a key role for the future of Ukraine’s energy sector. Ukraine has one of the most well-developed and all-encompassing gas transportation infrastructures of any country in the world, in terms of both domestic deliveries and export facilities.

[...]

&gt;A significant part of the multidimensional Ukrainian gas infrastructure is the huge underground gas storage facilities that the country controls. [...] If fully exploited, Ukraine could hypothetically add almost one third to the approximately 100 bcm of storage space that EU member states currently hold as a whole. Thus, it is no surprise that the energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie recently suggested that Ukraine holds the key to Europe’s gas current storage crunch.

So, all in all. You were right to question my statements. If Russia didn't attack Ukraine it would have probably meant a decrease of Russian budget by around 2% by 2040. And in the most optimistic case of getting back to Soviet productions a decrease of Russian state budgets of 10%. Not enough to cripple it, but still enough to make a dent. However it would pose a challenge for Russia if Ukraine got western investments in gas production leading to a higher increase in production, while the EU would be cutting down on Russian gas. But those are what-ifs.",4447840eebd14d5f87a6c336dd630223b7e984ec,True,False,,,,,0,1655154975,,0,{},ic923hm,False,t3_vb9igw,False,True,t1_ic8jy12,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vb9igw/former_russian_prime_minister_mikhail_kasyanov/ic923hm/,1655154991,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655126175.0,

When this day will come it will be up to Ukraine to be smarter than the orcs. Macron never said anything else. In fact, he’s already acknowledging Russia’s defeat, way before others. His position has always be to stand behind Ukraine’s decision, no matter which propaganda is playing with idiots. Sadly this propaganda seems to work. People prefer public relationship and spectacular stories. 

I’m wondering what some people think now. Do you really believe that Ukraine, a country no one ever cared about before, is as their masterclass propaganda is saying? They are suffering to death. They were supposed to renew their army with Us and Eu finance. Corruption was still there. The upgrade didn’t happen.

Life in Ukraine is extremely difficult, and has always been. There are ukrainians everywhere in Poland, in Cz, they are not here for the landscape. They come to earn money to send back to the  country, already extremely poor, now with parts almost wiped.

What do you think will happen if Ukraine will manage to push out russians out of the frontiers? That everything will become like before? There will be a moment where there will be negotiations, and yes, it would be stupid to humiliate Russia too much. Because they won’t vanish. They have restrictions? They don’t give a shit . They will keep expanding anywhere else. It’s in their nature. Not only Putin; people around him are worse. 

So what’s the plan, if Ukraine manages to push back Russia? It wont mean they will win the war. They may probably not be able to take back Dombass, Crimea even less. 

Russia will still exist no matter what is done, unlesss they are nuked. 

So , there will have to be negotiations. Maybe you think russians will do anything Ukraine will want? They still have their homeland. Their infrastructures. Their gas. Tell ukrainians to attack, let’s take Moscow! After all, we don’t care, those are just ukrainians. No US or EU, NATO will put a single finger for that.

Let’s make russia pay? Do you know the history or Russia? As far as they can remember they have been just lucky not to starve or to get shot or deported without any single reason. Life has no meaning in Russia. It has always been like that. Go out of Moscow, St Petersburg, the country is a shithole with no proper roads, there is no public infrastructure except for order and propaganda. They are used to that. They don’t know anything else than boring life in a shithole. Some deported people under stalin who saw their family dying when sent in a siberian shithole with 10% or 20% of survival rate at their arrival… now they regret those times. This is so fckd up, but it’s facts. 

Russia has always lived in propaganda and still believe in it. A few years ago, my wife (we live in Czech Republic) was working for a branch of motorola in CZ. A russian tech guy, very smart, very cool, came here a fee weeks for s knowledge transfer or whatever. They had the surprise that in  2015 or something, someone was still thinking Russia saved the Czech in 1968 by pushing back the nazis to the west!!! A smart guy was still thinking this, and ngshitty life before being ‘hired’.

Russia has not really evolved since middle age exept the cities. You want something? You pay. Justice doesn’t exist in this country. Human rights are a joke. In few words: life in Russia is shit, and has always been.
But russians get something in return, only one thing: a beautiful story. They are russians, members of the mighty, beautiful, epic, slavic russia, biggest country of the world, certainly the most beautiful. Paradise on earth. This is what they have, and they are proud of it…. What else anyway? They know their life worth nothing , that their masters can kill everyone in the oblast just because they had a bad day.

And they are in danger! Always. Don’t forget that pogrom is a russian word. The book of the jewish conspiracy’protocol of the elders of Zion’ is russian. There has always been this ‘enemy’. The ‘enemy of the great russia’ have a name: nazis. We are, you are, the west and its decadence despised by the great Russia. EU are cowards, US too but have weapons. But they are able to elect Trump.
Putin is admired by many people. Not for being Putin, but for his visiin of great russia.

In their minds, they have time. They lost half of the army? I wouldnt be surprised they develop lebensboen. Putin is sick? There are many worse than him ready to take the role. What is happening in Ukraine is not even a war for them!!!

So what should Ukraine do when, or if, they manage to kick russia out of their country. Ask for money? Ask for the millions of ukrainians already being reeducated?

Ukraine will not get anything like that. The russians despise them. They have no money. They have allies, that’s for sure, but allies who are not and don’t want war with Russia.

Russia won’t give anything and if some day this will become a war, then…. We will need to be good negotiators. Or just wipe them. But we will be wiped too.

Some people may get me wrong. I love Ukraine. My best friend is fighting somewhere. We help refugees. An old couple we love wants to go back to Kyiv this week, despite our invitation. One of my close friends is waiting for a message from her husband while raisingvtheir kid, alone. Text messages are brief. What we know about the situation is disneyland compared to what’s happening there. 

But all the weapons, all the help…. Wont bring back Ukrainians to life. Russians don’t care: they are already dead. And when the time will come to negotiate, ….. Ukraine will need to be smart. Unless we, behind our laptops, are mobilized and sent to war. Because Russia will not lose, even if it looks like they will. Remember, they are not in war. I hope so much that russians will revolt, but as I understood, it’s unlikely to happen so far.

So no, Macron is not a cunt (btw he never asked anything to Ukraine, just offered military help to unlock Odessa, and hope for the best for Ukraine…) people doing PR are cunts, people who don’t think about the future are cunts. It’s not a video game, where your minister take nice pics in front of a bubch of missiles you send to Ukraine.

I hate to say that, but Putin or not, Russia will not vanish from the map. They have allies, money, resources, and zombies ready to obey and who will be ready to do anything if some troops walk on their soil. They don’t risk death… they are dead. 

Slava Ukraini

This is where we are. One day, Ukraine will have tonegociate with them.

&gt;under the condition they stop all the far right neo nazi bullshit.

lol, telling neo-nazis dedicated enough to tool up and actually fight for what they believe to tone it down wink wink nudge nudge was an on the ground necessity for Ukraine. We are adults, we can admit the necessity of it. Let's not pretend a genuine argument was had where those men then totally abandoned their ideology they believed enough to fight for. They were told it was bad optics and to tone it down.

Like, think of this logically? Why incorporate it at all unless out of necessity? Do men give up their beliefs so easily? Moreover let's say it was totally a Theseus ship, not the same crew, nor boards, nor rudder, nor sails, just the name... Why keep it around? Why keep it around with that name and its fucking runes?

&gt;I work with the the Royal Air Force actually and have been following this conflict for 9 years

Okay cool - and as someone who had a lot of work based in Ukraine during euromaidan and known people on both sides of the conflict as a result at euromaidan, at Odessa, in Donbas from the beginning, I know Azov well, very well. I've known people on both sides. I've known people on one side who eventually joined the other. I've seen this process in real time unfold. So, congrats on your credentials but I'm not sure where in being in the RAF that makes anyone who disagrees with you a Russian lmao. You can't have it both ways so that you are uniquely qualified to talk but anyone not of your unique position is a Russian - poor logic.

The difference between you and I is that I don't feel the need to maintain a party line on Ukraine to support the Ukrainian people. You do. So continue to peddle the bullshit that a desperate Ukraine bringing neo-nazis into the formal military set up was holding the cards and denazified them in miraculous time between all that fighting, rather than offered them real training and weapons for toning down the rhetoric that exists to this day. You can't say the RHETORIC doesn't exist to this day when they are still waving and wearing fucking runes dude lol. As said, party line - ignore what your eyes see in front of them, maintain the line.

Also I'm sure if it was your will and if the communists like you were a majority in US (there would be no US at all already lol) - not a single dollar or weapon would have been sent to Ukraine, (heavy weapons shipments to Ukraine could start WW3 and such idiotic fearmongering clueless populist BS bla bla bla).

Is this a recent picture?

I notice in the comments some people use the words Nazi, Nationalist, or Fascist as accusations of a crime. Being a party member is not a crime. Committing a crime is a crime. It's not a good sign when we believe it's fine to say ""kill all the nazis"". Letting labels decide who is worthy of humanity is Step 2 of the 10 warning signs of genocide. It's the logical fallacy of the Russian people right now.

&gt;Several factors contributed to the high casualty ratios. The Korean Peninsula is densely populated. Rapidly shifting front lines often left civilians trapped in combat zones. Both sides committed numerous massacres and carried out mass executions of political prisoners. Modern aircraft carried out a vast bombing campaign, dropping massive loads of napalm along with standard bombs.

&gt;In fact, by the end of the war, the United States and its allies had dropped more bombs on the Korean Peninsula, the overwhelming majority of them on North Korea, than they had in the entire Pacific Theater of World War II.

*****
&gt; More than 15,000 millionaires are expected to flee Russia this year, as wealthy citizens turn their back on Vladmir Putin&amp;#039;s regime after the invasion of Ukraine, according to an analysis of migration data.

&gt; &amp;quot;UK has lost its wealth hub crown, and the US is fading fast as a magnet for the world&amp;#039;s wealthy, with the UAE expected to overtake it by attracting the largest net inflows of millionaires globally in 2022,&amp;quot; Henley said in its report, which is based on &amp;quot;Systematically tracking international private wealth migration trends&amp;quot;.

&gt; About 4,000 HNWIs are expected to have moved to the UAE by the end of the year, ahead of Australia, which is expected to attract about 3,500, Singapore and Israel.

First and second are the US and the UK who both have contractual obligations resulting from the [Budapest memorandum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum_on_Security_Assurances). Third is Poland that does not only provide a lot of military aid but also hosts the highest number of Ukrainian refugees in Europe, a fact that is often forgotten.

It was originally funded and founded by a far-right billionaire oligarch named Andriy Biletsky. A quote from before he founded the militia said that the mission of Ukraine should be to ""*lead the white races of the world in a final crusade against Semite-led Untermenschen*"" (Untermenschen being a Nazi wored for non-aryan undesirable peoples).

It has used quite a few different pieces of Nazi symbolism in their own banners and emblems, such as the Wolfsangel and the Black Sun.

No one can deny that at the time of it's founding it the militia was 100% a neo-Nazi militia founded on the principles of white supremacy. 

Now, with that said, the battalion was nationalized in 2017 when Ukraine took all the independent and privately started militias around the country and told them they either needed to allow themselves to be folded into the military proper or disband.

Azov was folded into the military and military command ran through a series of background checks and psych evaluations of members at the time in an effort to weed out as much of the neo-Nazi members as possible.

Those who didn't pass the examinations were dismissed from the battalion and but offered civilian security positions instead.

How successful that process was at removing the neo-nazi component from Azov is up for debate at this point. They were still using Nazi symbolism in 2019-2020, but since the war started and focus has come on them they seem to be trying to remove that too.

The regiment was founded in 2014 by Sergey Korotikhi (Botsman)  and two Georgian volunteers, Bakhva Chikobava and Giorgi Kuparashvili (sent by the ex georgian president Saakashvili). Although Korotkikh might be linked to far right extremists, the other founders were certainly not. The unit was initially formed as a volunteer group in May 2014 out of the ultra-nationalist Patriot of Ukraine gang, and the neo-Nazi Social National Assembly (SNA) group. However, as it grew, expended to a battalion and transformed to be incorporated into the Ukrainian armed forces the far right elements got dissolved and mostly removed from the new formation. The black sun symbol was removed as early as 2015. 

As I said: ""This is just a stupid excuse for Russia to justify its aggression just like it used a similarly stupid excuse to invade Georgia in 1921 to liberate it from evil capitalists, while the latter had a socialist government, similarly to how the nazi Ukraine is lead by a Jewish president, lol.""

However, the ambiguity of Macron’s pronouncements on Russia has obscured all this, leading to consternation not just in Kyiv, but also in Warsaw and the Baltic states, just at the time that Ukrainian forces are fending off the Russian onslaught in the eastern Donbas region. “Imagine if someone had told France ‘Let’s not humiliate the Kaiser’ in the middle of the battle of Verdun,” Duclos says.

Talk of humiliation is “unfortunate”, Dumoulin notes, because it echoes the story the Kremlin tells of the way Russia was treated by the west after the collapse of the Soviet Union. And these missteps are compounded, she adds, by a “pre-existing . . . suspicion” of the old Gaullist tradition of collaboration with Russia, which Macron has revived with his attempts to establish a rapport with Putin.

This is now hurting Macron’s leadership in Europe, says Duclos. The French president is deluding himself, he argues, if he thinks a long-lasting peace settlement is possible while Putin is in power. “This position makes his security and integration agenda more difficult to achieve,” he says.

Martin says that the “immense” reputational cost Macron is bearing comes as the war is undermining his plans for a more autonomous European defence policy. “Europe’s dependence on the US will increase [and] Nato will remain the main framework of European security for a while.”

A foreign policy reset is needed, Duclos says, starting with Macron making a clear commitment to Nato and outlining a path to Ukraine’s EU membership.

Why not travel to Odesa, he suggests? The blockaded Black Sea port is at the centre of UN-led talks to allow Ukrainian grain to be shipped out of the country. The French president, who travelled to Kyiv before the war, has been criticised for not returning to Ukraine since. “He needs to deliver a few gestures to regain a central position in Europe,” says Duclos.",3115aa1e9e520649aa5e75f7da33b20b11720567,True,False,,,,,0,1655148420,,0,{},ic8mi2k,True,t3_vbk5y9,False,True,t1_ic8mh5i,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vbk5y9/macrons_missteps_obscure_frances_support_for/ic8mi2k/,1655148436,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655119620.0,

**The president has faced significant criticism for his call not to ‘humiliate’ Russia**

Question Emmanuel Macron’s choice of words, his taste for the pensée complexe or his ability to read the room, say those striving to explain the French president’s plea to avoid “humiliating” Moscow — but don’t question his support for Ukraine in its war with Russia.

Some have interpreted Macron’s call — first issued in a speech to European parliament and repeated in a recent interview with French media — as implying that Ukraine should be pushed into a ceasefire and territorial concessions. But if Russia risks being humiliated, the opposite conclusion could be drawn. “Implicit in the formulation is that Russia will be somehow defeated,” says Michel Duclos, adviser to the Paris-based Institut Montaigne.

A sympathetic construal of Macron’s remarks is that he is planning for the “day after”, says Marie Dumoulin, director of the Wider Europe programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations. In Strasbourg he suggested he had the post-conflict resolution in mind when he said that “humiliation” and “revenge” had “wreaked havoc on the roads to peace”, a reference to Europe’s war-torn history and the controversial Treaty of Versailles in 1919.

He has also reminded Nato allies that while they are backing Ukraine, they have ruled out direct military confrontation with its nuclear-armed aggressor and will have to find a way to coexist with Moscow when the conflict is over. On Friday, the Elysée insisted France wanted Ukraine to emerge “victorious”.

“The idea is: Moscow should not win, but in the long term, after the war has ended, a revanchist Russia is not in Europe’s interest,” Dumoulin says.

Until then Macron wants to preserve a line of communication with the Kremlin — which he insists is a Kyiv request — if only to help prevent escalation. “You can’t rule out an accident. Not many can talk to Putin and Macron is trying to minimise the nuclear threat,” says Alexandra Martin, of the Brastislava-based Globsec Policy Institute.

Critics who accuse Macron of working against Ukraine’s interests also arguably overlook Paris’ involvement in western efforts to help Kyiv. It is sending heavy artillery systems, has dispatched officers to help investigate war crimes and also sent troops to Romania as part of Nato’s eastern flank reinforcement. In Brussels, it has pushed for an EU-wide oil embargo and has backed each of the six EU economic sanction packages against Moscow. Newly appointed foreign minister Catherine Colonna travelled to Kyiv last month.",eb379059f2b6ab062cddd717537f2a9f679ce809,True,False,,,,,0,1655148409,,0,{},ic8mh5i,True,t3_vbk5y9,False,True,t3_vbk5y9,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vbk5y9/macrons_missteps_obscure_frances_support_for/ic8mh5i/,1655148421,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655119609.0,

You go out to Times Square and say ""the war is wrong"" during the invasion, expect to have someone come up to you and punch you. Right or wrong has nothing to do with it. You don't become less political if you have a more ""correct"" position on a war. 

You want a controversial opinion?

If Ukraine had an actual plan before, during and after Euromaidan they could have avoided all this lost territory and all these casualties. They had a decent situation, half between Russia and half between the EU. They reaped the benefits of both relationships. Now, the EU was the better choice, obviously, because of anti-corruption and other things, but they never, ever had a plan to actually get there. 8 years later, they are no closer to joining the EU or recovering lost territory. In fact, they control even less territory than before. 

Even though this above opinion is in my opinion pretty valid, to go to Kyiv now and say this might get you beaten, shot, put in prison or sent to the frontlines. Because it is no longer about being right or wrong, the country is being invaded and that takes priority, for obvious reasons and the people must rally around the country and the army.",5b18ca42909c61f0b4c319025b0720a323d4851c,True,False,,,,,0,1655147406,,0,{},ic8k3sh,False,t3_vbifvd,False,True,t1_ic8ildv,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vbifvd/ukrainian_tv_presenter_anna_olytska_and_her_son/ic8k3sh/,1655147422,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655118606.0,

However...

If your enemy has a lot of one type of weaponry and focusing on using it as its primary form of attack, doesn't it make more sense to use a rock, paper, scissors approach and instead of asking for more of what the enemy has, to ask for more of what counters what the enemy has?

If we think in terms of classical warfare, halberds beat cavalry beat archers beat halberds.

What is the counter to artillery? Long range accurate missiles for sure, but that's expensive and i don't think the west could supply enough. Maybe fast moving troop carriers that can get close to the artillery and take it out then bug out before the enemy can respond?

1. It is total export, we in EU can only sanction for EU so we need EU data, not the whole Russia export.
2. Data is from 2019. Oil has gone up 2x from those time but in that link you send it literally says: ""Gas prices in Europe in April were about five times the level they should be this time of the year"" So the ration between oil and gas revenue is ”little” different today.
3. Oil can be shipped with tankers relatively easy so when EU sanctions for oil are set, Russia will just sell oil somewhere else (with discount) and EU will buy oil from somewhere else so Russia is just making little less profit but still significant amount. To my understanding Russia has next to no options for the pipe gas if it does not sell it to EU so that would actually reduce a lot of revenue.

So I'm still not convinced that gas is just fart in the wind. I have not calculated it for the whole EU but I did calculation for Germany using today's spot prices and 2020 consumption's and ended up to numbers where Germany actually uses more € to gas than oil. My calculations may be off though since I do not know the actual prices Germany pays for oil and gas, those might be something else than the spot prices.",10974070507d05f7ef6e9f260c1bcb3e92b3f50c,True,False,,,,,0,1655147227,,0,{},ic8jole,False,t3_vb8xfa,False,True,t1_ic8d0v3,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vb8xfa/the_german_xrussian_has_repatriated_from/ic8jole/,1655147241,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655118427.0,

That’s more than half the pre-war army. While it’s possible the DPR army significantly has expanded with mobilizations, the loss of nearly 11,000 people in just three months likely crippled many of the army’s pre-war maneuver battalions.

You seem to be so angry (to be fair with considerable justification) that you arnt able to summon up any empathy at all for a random Russian person and what this does and will look like to them.  Even If you truly don't care about the 100,000,000 + Russians.  I still think this is an important exercise.

We have leveled against them an absolutely crushing suite of sanctions and I would argue that we should probably go further.  But this is going to make the lives of the average Russian progressively harder.  These are mostly just people.  Some have some very questionable ideas and loyalty but they are mostly at the core just people.  They don't have control of anything.  We are squeezing these people in hopes that things will get so bad that they will rise up internally or at least somehow bend Putin to their will (this seems unlikely at best but pressure is pressure and we should use what we can)

You are suggesting that we should, after squeezing the shit out of these people, immediately hit them again with a massive reparations bill?  Thats how you create generational hatred.  Generational hatred catalyzes war.

I agree that crime can't pay.  But are you really prepared to hold all Russians accountable for Putin?

Would you be OK with being accountable for Trump or Biden(assuming you are american) or your countries leader if you arnt)?  How would you feel if someone punished you extremely harshly for what they did?

We have been telling 30 years how these states are Nazi-states that oppress Russian minority. If you dare to move NATO troops to fight over the Baltics, we use nukes.  
  
Many Western countries don't dare. Their populations don't care right now what happening in Ukraine or are afraid of nuclear war. Even if their politicians decide to liberate Baltics, Russia uses smaller nuke on some NATO base in Poland.

Russians make fake referendums, all the Baltic states vote to join Russia (like they did in the first time in the Baltics). After 2 years some Western governments want to warm up relations with Russia ""*because Russia is big and important, we can't ignore Russia forever.*"" Done!  
  
The West is shitting their pants right now not over fighting boots on the ground but if they send a shitload of effective heavy weapons, Russia wouldn't like it.

My concern is that Turkey's demands here are untenable. If Turkey was asking for $$$, sure, that's attainable. But Turkey has twin impossible demands: (1) deliver advanced Western weapons despite the presence of advanced Russian systems which have the potential if not guaranteed function of leaking such Western technology to Russia and (2) deport whoever Turkey points at.

Could this all be an opening bargaining position for not-these things? Sure, but that destroys the perceived-strongman domestic political advantage when he visibly gets none of what he was asking for besides, at best, a payoff.

Maybe Turkey is *incompetent* in making these demands, but it does look like the opening salvo of making big asks in hopes of getting lucky in active disregard of the prospect of continued inclusion in NATO. Which is why I settle back at: this is pretextual and on Russia's behalf. Russia buys a delay as long as they think it will take to conquer Ukraine, at which point they can go back to threatening Scandinavia directly and won't need Turkey. Turkey probably gets nothing except whatever Russia promised it, but doesn't care because it's on its way out of NATO. 

How do you come back from this break in trust? The West hasn't budged on the S400 problem, and obviously no Western democracy is going to serve as Erdogan's goon squad to abduct dissidents for him.

I'm worried that Erdogan is making big bets in anticipation of making big moves, rather than this just being the usual piddling shakedown.",51af39546aa44981b4958822e9e321255283260e,True,False,,,,,0,1655144324,,0,{},ic8cuir,False,t3_vayxju,False,True,t1_ic8a0fh,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vayxju/finland_refuses_to_join_nato_without_sweden_this/ic8cuir/,1655144337,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655115524.0,

 It's got nothing to do with emotions. It's demonstrably stupid to allow crime to pay. Surely that isn't difficult to understand?

&gt;Reparations come from the Russian people (the one that sanctions are allready squeezing). How much do you think they can give before desperate actions make sense.

WW1 Germany's punitive debts were arguably of an unwarranted severity, where as the Post WW2 debts were completely warranted.

You can definitely say financial insecurity contributed to the Nazis rise, but it was blaming that on communists that never held political power, Jewish bankers that made up a statistically irrelevant portion of the banking system, and a million other lies meant to dehumanize and scapegoat LGBTQ people, unionists; basically everyone not in their base is what led to the holocaust. Lumping everyone into one mass by calling it cultural bolshevism or Cultural Jewry is far more responsible for where things went. 

(PS calling everyone woke or groomers is the same radicalizing BS and they know it)

I think its fair to say those financial debts had very different outcomes and you can't really say they have any particular pattern of ineffectiveness.

&gt; Russia has killed hundreds of civilians in the north-eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv using indiscriminate shelling and widely-banned cluster munitions, according to new research by Amnesty International.

&gt; Cluster munitions are controversial because they detonate in the air and release a cluster of smaller bombs which fall indiscriminately over a wide area, potentially putting civilians at risk.

&gt; At the site of one apparent cluster munition strike in Kharkiv, around a housing estate and playground in the Industrialnyi neighbourhood, the spalling effect was visible around three separate impacts on three sides of a playground.

Sweden for example might say that they are having internal political issues with their left wing government that needs to be reformed. 

&gt;I'm 85% confident Russia is behind this - there wouldn't be both a surprise objection from Turkey and a ""we don't care if Sweden and Finland join NATO"" public statement from Russia if they weren't pulling strings to prevent it.

I dont think you should be. Turkey's surprise objection is very bad, but it is way easier explained to be for his own benefit to cause a PR disaster for NATO for his own political gains. He has elections next year and Turkey is suffering 140% inflation. They have some kind of complex about the west and acting like a strongman is a good way to gain support inside Turkey. That's why Turkey has done this multiple other NATO matters. 

The part about Russia saying ""we dont care"" is not really a surprise. As someone living in Finland I was saying that already 2 months ago. Youtubers and some international media headlines are blowing it way out of proportion. Of course it's a negative for Russia, but they already have seen Sweden and Finland part of the NATO block for 3 decades since both joined EU and started training together with NATO. The international headlines about ""ending neutrality"" are a little misleading. It's more like ending OFFICIAL military nonalignment, but it's not like Russia saw either of us very neutral. 

Russia has a very common strategy where their lower level politicians make very scary headlines, but because they are not made by Putin, they don't have to follow up on those threats. They are meant to spread FUD in the west and make people cautious about supporting Ukraine. When their bluff is called it doesn't matter because Putin didnt say it. Also all the statements done by the people high up are usually always pretty vague. Like when Putin says ""there will be a response to them joining NATO"" it can just be them building more military bases in the north.

There is always a chance that Turkey has decided to turn against NATO and this is the start of that meltdown, but I highly doubt it.

It appears up until the battle for Severodonetsk the Ukrainian approach was to trade space for time, let the enemy overextend and then attack their supply lines.

In this phase of the war, Russia's supply lines are not overextended because Severodonetsk is not very distant from the Russian border, so that strategy will not work.

Should they abandon the city without a fight?  Perhaps, but there's also the opportunity to inflict some serious casualties on Russia because Ukraine *knows* they are going to try to capture that city at all costs.

Tactically, it is a wonderful killing zone for Ukraine with prepared positions on the high ground and a river crossing Russia would have to deal with, along with the difficulty fighting in an urban environment.  They had the opportunity to inflict serious casualties, and they took it.

It is a battle of attrition now, so by defending (and later retreating) they are attritting Russia's resources.

It also appears to have made the Kherson offensive in the south possible, since Russia has reportedly diverted materiel and soldiers from that front to the East.

And if he loses territory, he can simply claims its all the fault of NATO. They were not fighting Ukraine, they were fighting NATO.

""Oceania was at war with Eastasia. Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia""

Or, one of my favourite takes on this is from the Nemesis the Warlock comics. The leadership of humanity have for many years been at war with aliens, describing them as unclean and needing purging. They use that fear and hatred to retain control of the masses who live in bad conditions. However, at one point the Humanity is forced to make peace with the aliens. This presents the leadership with a problem, they need a new enemy. So they call in the Chief Bigot and ask for a solution. The solution, to present people with freckles as the new enemy. Of course, only after any high ranking officials have any offending blemishes removed from their skin!

It is as much about conquering as it is about maintaining the powerposition. In 2010's it was discovered that Ukraine had vast reserves of gas and a bit of oil. 

Now keep in mind that extracting oil and gas takes years before the proper infrastructure is in place (Nord stream 2 took more than 10 years by a Dutch/Swiss company). And in Russia's case most infrastructure is from the Sovjet era. Current day Russia is lacking the people, knowledge and tools to build new systems or even maintaining them. So all current wells and pipes must be used to the maximum to get as much wealth into the country. 

Russia's economy is energy export for a lot and wheat for a bit. 

Now to Ukraine. Ukraine has 2 or 3 huge Sovjet pipelines going through the country. Now since Ukraine also appeared to have gas reserves, they would only need to connect the extraction of gas onto the current network and russian gas could be blocked (leading to frozen pipelines that take decades to get running again). 

As western countries would be more than willing to trade Ukrainian gas, Russia's income would drop off a cliff. And overnight (4-5 years) Ukraine could have destroyed Russia's power position without a fight. This is the reason for the annexation of the Donbas and Crimean peninsula. Since that was where the most reserves were found.

Some people suggest one of the reasons Putin invaded Ukraine is because how it was developing to become a modern wealthy country. That would look terrible for Putin considering Russia has much more resources and more people, yet lags behind.

Because warfare has changed since World War II, no longer can you repurpose some car factory into making medium tanks in a relatively short time. 

Military tech nowadays is insanely complex and dependent of even more complex supply and production purposes. 

Even more so, said modern equipment requires a whole ton of training and logistical chains to be properly used. Its just can't be done in any sort of quick manner for the standards of this conflict. 

The US seems to have scrapped the barrel trying to find any Soviet gear they could send which would be far easier to integrate into the UA military but that seems to have reached its limit. 

As to why they aren't just sending all the modern gear that they can and just try to train people and set up the logistic as fast as possible, I suppose they're afraid. 

You don't become the leader of a major Western nation by being a radical (with some exceptions...) and Russia in all aspects but one (nuclear weapons) is a meaningless threat to the West. But any escalation in the conflict raises the possibility of nuclear war, even if its from 0.001 to 0.01, its still the one single possibility that could not just dethrone the US and its allies from their current global domination even if there was nobody left to replace them.

They just want this strange, anachronistic thing to just go away one way or the other so their domestic politics don't get affected even more by the looming economic crisis or the catastrophic food crisis in Africa that may drive another mass of migration towards Europe.

I think it's easy and it feels good to be outraged towards his and others meandering support towards Ukraine but the reality is that national leaders exist to serve (at best) national interests and the strange mix of events of Russia's brutal aggression with their humiliating performance has caused a strange situation where they remain a massive threat to Ukraine but have been essentially defanged in the eyes of Europe. 

Even if they manage to eek out some victory against Ukraine, what will they even have left to even threaten anyone else? their economy will also be hurt and so any sort of massive rearmament seems rather unlikely.

I think there's a calculus being, both in Germany and France, that right now the biggest threat to their nations and the EU as a whole is the spiralling inflation caused partially by the war and the prospect of another massive wave of migration as less fortunate countries buckle against ever growing food prices. 

That is of course a cold calculus but such is the reality of realpolitik which everyone uses nowadays.",969ac7e2dbf0caaad8ea9e16aaef03e9837b3f2f,True,False,,,,,0,1655138955,,0,{},ic80ee3,False,t3_vbgcuh,False,True,t3_vbgcuh,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vbgcuh/olaf_scholz_gets_lost_in_communication_over_war/ic80ee3/,1655138972,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655110155.0,

It's part of a series of deadly miscalculations by Russia. They also believe that if NATO does respond, escalate to de:escalate by using a single tactical nuke, just one, against a non-nuclear member of NATO, to cow them into backing down. The 3 nuclear powers of NATO don't have any of those smaller tactical nukes to retaliate with, so would have to use a strategic nuke, an escalation in itself that the trans-loving pant wetters in the West won't do, leading to a humiliating climbdown convincing the non Nuclear members that they aren't really protected by the nuclear umbrella, and so nope out of fighting Russia for fear of getting the same treatment. Russia might actually be right on this one.

They also believe they can bite and hold on this. Take the Baltics/Poland before NATO's full military might can be brought to bear, then threaten nukes if NATO forces try to push them out.

See the theme? The West has placated Russia too often, de-escalated in the face of escalation, convincing Russians they can't lose as long as they go all in every time since the West will always fold. These are desperate gambles by a country without any better ideas for how to win, and assume that their adversaries have no pride and no honour, that they're fundamentally cowards.

Whenever anyone with any actual pull asks a state official, they immediately and invariably refer the question to the standing nuclear policy, which they also reaffirm. We see this with Lavrov and press secretaries alike. The most Russia has done is make noises about readiness. Which doesn’t matter; they’re always ready to go hot. That’s how MAD works. 

The nuclear saber rattling comes from the Russian counterpart to Tucker Carlson. And it’s intended for two audiences: the Russofascists and foreigners like you. 

Russia will not condone a first strike. They know that’s a red line. Everyone in the chain of command that has to actually authorize knows that once those nukes fly, *they* die in the retaliation. Not some random census figures on a report from some backwater oblast. They do. The guys who issue the orders would do so knowing they will die, their families will die, everything they’ve spent their life building will be snuffed out. 

And the Russian model of corruption inherently lends itself to promoting the corrupt and self-centered. It does not lend itself to true believers who will die for their cause. 

So Russia won’t launch first. And NATO has such an overwhelming conventional advantage that they don’t have to launch at all except in retaliation. An invasion of the Baltics would be an unmitigated disaster for Russia. Russia would need to engage in widespread mobilization, refurbishment of armor and IFVs, and mass procurement of arms and ammo to even conduct the operation at this point. And they’d still get ground into dust by NATO air power. To say nothing of an almost guaranteed escalation with Finland and Japan at the same time. 

Russia is not the Soviet Union. It doesn’t have the bodies for this. It won’t happen. And if they’re dumb enough to try, NATO will take a few days to spin up and then proceed to obliterate them. Russia knows all of this. And they know their Intel assets lied to them already, so they’ll be even more cautious moving forward.",48844840a8a2359049f2fa6e80f3e53a46706157,True,False,,,,,0,1655136895,,0,{},ic7vo3s,False,t3_vb9igw,False,True,t1_ic6xp3r,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vb9igw/former_russian_prime_minister_mikhail_kasyanov/ic7vo3s/,1655136914,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655108095.0,

So, since such discussions are pointless, let's stick to publicly available information.  And what we know is that a) so far, the allies have consistently underdelivered on promised and disappointed and what has been delivered has been far less than it was first sold as  b) Ukraine's economy faces a cliff edge as soon as at the end of summer c) logistical lines that stretch from the USA to donbass are shorter than those from, say, rostov.  d) support in europe is wavering or at least prone to waver / europe has not much more to give that matters decisively.

And to a degree can totally see the still existing, critical thoughts regarding germanys behavior. But still.. at the moment we do much of what is in our power and possible.  
One doesn't have to respect germanys extremely pacifistic nature since WW2. And it's certainly a good idea to criticize it at the moment. But this country and most of its inhabitants have learned to be very (!) careful with all kinds of military interventions and support. To the point of naivety and stubbornness. In times of the Kosovo-conflict and the german intervention our foreign minister was attacked by his own party (green, famous for the peace movement at the time... irony.) and lost hearing on one of his ears.

  
We are just about to get used to the thought of having a responsibility for our handling of Russia. Much too late and most likely not fast enough, regarding the circumstances, I would agree.

thanks great comment.

there's an interesting parallel between kherson and sieverdonetsk.  both are basically mirror images of each other - on the ""other side of the river"" so to speak.  I worry Ukraine may be fighting for severdonetsk on the theory that if it loses it, it will never have a chance to again cross the river anytime soon.  other than that, it's hard for me to understand why ukraine is fighting so hard for that city.  surrounded on 3 sides and if you take it you're still surrounded on 3 sides...  it seems very dangerous to me for ukraine.  and, the idea that ""yes, but they're killing a lot of russians"" isn't very convincing, either as russia also has a technological advantage in the region.

of course, the geography is not exactly the same and it's a bit more complex in donbass, as russia's stated aim is to take all of luhansk and donetsk oblasts.",bb186a33d9178e4cdd706c3e7efb2b180ded1ac8,True,False,,,,,0,1655133070,,0,{},ic7msbt,False,t3_vbdwfe,False,True,t1_ic7lv7m,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vbdwfe/this_ukrainian_soldiers_says_they_are_10/ic7msbt/,1655133088,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655104270.0,

You don’t need protection from someone that has collapsed. 

It absolutely is NATO’s fault.  

NATO’s idea of “protection” is more like a mafia turf / racketeering offering “protection” that directly puts a target on those countries because it directly aligns them against Russia.

It creates conflict not protects against it.

“If Russia stop kicking around the small kids”. Libya, Syria, Iraq got kicked around plenty by NATO this Russia is the only aggressor is an argument nobody will ever win.

The reality is that military alliances create conflict and are bad shows up again and again in history, and combine that with trying to expand towards Moscow and this has happened badly over and over again.

Charles XII tried it and failed
Napoleon tried it and failed
Hitler tried it and failed

It never works it always sparks a pushback and this time instead of an expansionary tyrant it is called NATO same story.  Same result.

Let's address this a bit carefully. My article title

&gt;**Arron Banks \[UK BREXIT bankroller\] loses libel action \[on Russian connections\] against reporter Carole**

suggests that the bankroller of Brexit (Aaron Banks) had undeclared connections with Russia. In the sense that he met with members of the Russian embassy team and then lied about it (in the sense of knowingly said something that was untrue), this was shown to have been true.

My title also clearly states that Banks was the bankroller of BREXIT and tbus directly implies that Russia was not the bankroller of Brexit. Your comment _""implies that Brexit was bankrolled by Russia""_ does not seem to me to be a fair representation. My title doesn't use the word ""finances"" since that's the bit that seems to be incorrect.

Now let's go into the details of ""the Electoral Commission investigated and found that it was not"".  Actually the EC said that said that it had reasonable grounds to suspect that:

* Mr Banks was not the true source of the £8m loans made to Better for the Country Ltd and Leave.EU. 
* Loans to Better for the Country Ltd on behalf of Leave.EU involved a non-qualifying or impermissible company – Rock Holdings Ltd, which is incorporated in the Isle of Man.[1]
* Mr Banks, Ms Bilney and others involved in Better for the Country Ltd, Leave.EU and associated companies concealed the true details of these financial transactions.
    A number of criminal offences may have been committed.

And then referred the investigation to the NCA which concluded that:

* Mr Banks took a loan from Rock Holdings Ltd, a company of which he is the ultimate beneficial owner. He was legally entitled to do so.
* Mr Banks was legally entitled, in his capacity as an individual, to release these funds to Better for the Country Ltd, by instructing another of his companies, Rock Services Ltd, to make the transactions on his behalf.
* Rock Holdings Ltd was not involved in these transactions in a manner which contravened PPERA.

None of which actually concludes about where Rock Holdings got the money from originally. In other words they didn't fully investigate the sources of funds, the best they did was state that:

&gt; The NCA has not received any evidence to suggest that Mr Banks and his companies received funding from any third party to fund the loans, or that he acted as an agent on behalf of a third party.

At the same time Banks has made statements like

Western countries don't have those to give. Tanks, IFVs, self propelled howitzers? Those all have training requirements and long tail of logistics for parts and repair. Ok, so we could send them more 155 towed howitzers (not just m777, but older models that require shipment by sea). That's pretty much it. And I suspect these are flowing now, as part of lend lease, but it takes time.

To sum up: heavy weapons now, logistic disaster later.",c095afc8ea880154d37c86aa137070f895f5465c,True,False,,,,,0,1655132006,,0,{},ic7kcmu,False,t3_vbcflk,False,True,t1_ic7j53z,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vbcflk/it_seems_that_the_russians_have_not_managed_to/ic7kcmu/,1655132023,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655103206.0,

Two comments on your take:

First, the fence is obviously not supposed to stop a tank, it likely won't even stop a person determined to get thru, it's there to make the act of crossing the border difficult to do without being noticed.

Second, what happened to those refugees is terrible, but the alternative would have been worse. Lukashenko brought those people to the border to use as a weapon. If Poland had let thru 1000 then Lukashenko would have brought 10,000, and then 100,000, and far more refugees would have been harmed.

What I am saying though is that the western countries had 8 years (14 even counting from Georgia) to realize the threat from Russia and make some preparations in case of a russian attack. And what we see now is that, if western Europe would be attacked by the imaginary second-best world army that Russia sees itself as, it would be completely defenseless, not only having no reasonable military or short-term production capabilities to fend off this imaginary Russia, but also continuing to pay them for gas and oil in what would probably be the biggest show of humiliation in recent history.

Coming off from the public news alone, it's almost as if there's no urgency, no realization that the security of other European countries hang in the balance together with Ukraine. (Not saying it's factually true, I'm talking about the impression that I have from reading the news personally). 

I can't stop thinking about how in the first days of war Lindner, when coming to discuss the dire situation with our ministers, just said that Kyiv would fall in a few days anyway, and it's much better to discuss the next Ukrainian government than any sort of military aid. Guys like Arestovich hinted that this was far from the only person who replied in such a way. I get sad just thinking about the possibility that this was it, the great western preparations for the Russian advance on European territories. Just concede and continue business as usual...

The point of my rant is that for many Ukrainians the anti-german sentiment that may sometimes appear, is more emotional than factual, but this sentiment does have a right to exist IMO, both because of the past events and current behavior coming off from the news articles, which may or may not be close to the truth.

And if Ukraine tries, there will be nukes, Russian doctrine makes this crystal-clear. NATO will probably enter the war under this pretext, but I am fairly positive that this will lead to the same scenario as I described above (i.e. nothing will happen until NATO goes on the offensive, which they won't). Or if China enters as well, we will have WW3 on our hands with pretty much the same outcome (nukes flying if NATO attacks).

&amp;#x200B;

Crimea is militarily, and I would argue even politically, lost. There is a chance to gain it back or have it as an autonomous state after pushing Russia out of Donbas (which is also unlikely\*) in peace-negotiations, imho. But without high-level marine- and air-support Crimea is pretty much unconquerable as long as Russia claims it as their land.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, the Putin regime had 8 years to resettle the Crimean population. What will happen with these Russians? Remove them by force? I am pretty sure that at this point most of the Crimean population doesn't want to be part of Ukraine anymore. It is of course illegal what Russia did, by any standard, but even brainwashed people are people, and harming them by forcefully resettling or disowning their homes is not right either.

Reparations or any  (financial-)compensation is what Ukraine should go for, in my opinion. Any more is just unachievable without unleashing WW3 or serious moral repercussions.

&amp;#x200B;

\*: Taking whole of Donbas back (pre-2014 Ukrainian borders) is also very unlikely without similar downsides.

Russia/DNR/LNR will use the population there as human shields and bargaining chips (they already do). How do you conquer a population-centre of &gt;1M people without bloodshed? You don't (see: Aleppo, Baghdad, etc.). And hypothetically, after you take it, what do you think the population will do, after bombing their homes? Not greet you with open arms that is. The political support for the Ukrainian government is at most 30% in the occupied Donbas regions (for a variety of reasons). I would estimate more like 10%. Because all people who cared, left for Ukraine in the past eight years. This fraction of support makes re-occupying/taking back this land also near impossible (politically).",c5774dde0146805a06867f1cef1fa02f09387417,True,False,,,,,0,1655131050,,0,{},ic7i6pj,False,t3_vaysh0,False,True,t1_ic7cwpy,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vaysh0/russias_war_with_ukraine_affects_billions_nato/ic7i6pj/,1655131068,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655102250.0,

the only positive thing in the Donbass is that in order to carry out these offensives from the north to Sloviansk and from the east to Severodonetsk and Lysychanks and Bakhmut the Russians have left their flanks uncovered in Izyum and the Ukrainians are taking advantage of it and are penetrating from the west through the forest .

Just a reminder that while this information is accurate to my knowledge, it is worth remembering that China and India are competing nations, that China has violated India's borders numerous times, and that Chinese media is not free press - they are heavily controlled and regulated by the Chinese state. SCMP is owned by the Alibaba group.

Whataboutism is often used by state media, including rusnia media (e.g. Redfish and Maffick), and it's important to consider the sources and how biased they are. If China says ""India bad"" it's likely because they are biased, and trying to downplay their own ties to Moscow.

2. ""nobles would fight as Varangians for the Byzantine Empire."" So... You realize what Varangian means right?  Varangian means Vikings but those that originate from/were based out of Rus.  Nobles ""didn't fight as Varangians"", they WERE Varangians.  FYI Nobles from Rus were called Knyaz, Boyars or Druzhina.  What you are trying to say is they would fight in the Varangian Guard which was a military group composed of Varangians  that fought for the Byzantines.

3. yes, instead Scholz did the smart reingabst initiated ring swaps, where the Ukrainians get weapons, that they don’t have to lean first, have the infrastructure and logistics for

4. can’t see anything wrong there, tearing nato units apart does require nato approved, I’m pretty sure of that (remember: Germany doesn’t have weapon stocks, so weapons need to be used from active units), for the other point: 

5. cool that Rheinmetall says so, doing ring swaps is still better, since it’s faster and so on, (first 6 Marder are only ready since a few days for example)

6. he never said that, I watched the interview, he said that no other G7 member sent western modern heavy weapons, which was/is true (no US,British, French tanks also)

7-10. if „later“ means: so many lies here, don’t know what the pressure has to do with it, Scholz clearly doesnt care about that, but what the money is for was clear from the beginning and also, that they can do whatever they want with it (not gonna search for the tweet from Strack-Zimmermann, do it yourself if you want), Melnyk is dumb, not sure what list he meant, but I know of a list, that was for immediately available things, he wanted submarine’s and frigates, which are not immediately available.

&gt; Taipei, June 13 Taiwan has joined more than 50 members of the World Trade Organization in signing a statement supporting Ukraine&amp;#039;s access to trade and warning of the ongoing impact on global food security of Russian military blockades.

&gt; &amp;quot;The impact of the war, including the blockage of Ukraine&amp;#039;s access to the Black Sea, is seriously jeopardizing food supply in some of the most vulnerable parts of the world [and] risks pushing millions of people into food insecurity,&amp;quot; the statement said.

&gt; Ukraine accounts for around 9 percent of global wheat exports, as well as 42 percent of the world&amp;#039;s sunflower oil and 16 percent of the world&amp;#039;s maize.

It‘s sad to admit but also important to acknowledge that we do live in a bipolar world, where the two powers USA and Russia fight and have always fought for influence all over the world.

There‘s no doubt that Russia is the agressor in the Ukrain war and responsible for countless crimes against humanity.
Playing down the role of NATO in the current situation is wrong however.

Back in the 90s soviet president Gorbachev received the nobel peace prize for his role in the peace process in europe. He pulled the soviet troops out of eastern germany in a peaceful manner in return for warranties that the unified germany would remain the eastern-most border of NATO, which turns out to have been a blatant lie, as about 20 years later the NATO member state have almost doubled including most former member states of warsaw pact.

Another important aspect to the current situation is the Maidan Revolution of Ukraine 2014.
Sadly there‘s more speculation than solid proof about the revolution, yet the thing we know is that pro-western demonstrators staged a coup against an elected government, establishing a new government without any new elections, which set the stage for a conflict that we now sadly have to watch the climax of.
Whether or not NATO or the US was involved in the revolt is a unverified speculation thus far, hence will not be covered.

In the end my point is that saying that NATO was never involved in the unkraine war, especially coming from a person with PhD, is simply not true, and while Russia certainly is to blame for their aggression against a sovereign state, the role of NATO in this conflict, especially for peace research purposes, shouldn‘t be played down like that.",0ce1ddf410e4743d45a68aacdb186f53064e45a9,True,False,,,,,0,1655121624,,0,{},ic700w5,False,t3_vao9kv,False,True,t3_vao9kv,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vao9kv/putin_has_now_made_it_crystal_clear_his_invasion/ic700w5/,1655121638,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655092824.0,

Analysis by Ishaan Tharoor 
June 13, 2022 at 12:01 a.m. EDT

Last September, Russian President Vladimir Putin was given a history lesson from a schoolchild. Putin was lecturing a gathering of students in the far-eastern city of Vladivostok about the merits of possessing “knowledge of the past” to have a “better understanding of today.” In one exchange, he invoked the great legacy of Russian czar Peter the Great, who he said defeated the Swedes at the Battle of Poltava in the Seven Years’ War against Sweden in 1709.

Except that wasn’t quite right, as Nikanor Tolstykh, a student from the Arctic Circle city of Vorkuta, reminded the Russian president. Russia fought Sweden in what’s known as the Great Northern War, which lasted more than two decades from 1700 to 1721. The Seven Years’ War was a sprawling, global conflict later in that same century during which Russia and Sweden actually were on the same side.

In the aftermath of this mild fact check, the principal of Tolstykh’s school decried the “arrogance” of her pupil in local media. In a separate interview, Tolstykh’s teacher admitted she would not have had the temerity to contradict Putin. A Kremlin spokesman insisted that Putin had an “absolutely phenomenal knowledge of history,” but that “he is always prepared to listen to such corrections, whether from a child or a specialist.”

Last Thursday, Putin showed that he had not forgotten this correction. At an event commemorating the 350th anniversary of Peter’s birth, he explicitly likened himself to the empire-expanding czar and celebrated his years of conquests.

“Peter the Great waged the Great Northern War for 21 years,” Putin said after visiting an exhibit in Peter’s honor. “It would seem that he was at war with Sweden, he took something from them. He did not take anything from them, he returned [what was Russia’s].”

The Russian president then alluded to the ongoing “special operation” in Ukraine, which he and his state’s propaganda arms have also cast as war of restoration and return — no matter that the sovereignty-violating invasion marks a grievous breach of international law and has led to many billions of dollars in damage to Ukraine’s towns and cities, the deaths of thousands of people and disruptions to the global economy that imperil millions more.

“What was [Peter] doing?” Putin said. “Taking back and reinforcing. That’s what he did. And it looks like it fell on us to take back and reinforce as well.”

Peter’s wars and territorial expansion helped shape the contours of the later Russian empire, pushing its frontiers to areas of Finland in the north and the Black Sea in the south. The Battle of Poltava that Putin cited saw Russian forces deliver an epochal blow to Sweden’s continental ambitions in Europe. A few years earlier, Peter established his west-facing capital of St. Petersburg on the Baltic Sea, built at the site of a captured Swedish fortress.

Putin has for years lionized the 18th century monarch and keeps a bronze statue of the czar over his ceremonial desk in the Kremlin’s cabinet room.

In a 2019 interview with the Financial Times, he declared that Peter “will live as long as his cause is alive.” At the time, the British newspaper interpreted that “cause” to be the preservation of Moscow’s “sphere influence” along the borderlands of an expanding NATO bloc.

But the ongoing war has revealed something more deep-seated in Putin’s psyche: a narrative of mythic destiny that supersedes any geopolitical imperative and which has set Russia on a bloody collision course with the West. Ukraine for Putin is an inseparable part of the Russian story; it is where Orthodox Christianity entered into Russian culture more than a millennia ago and therefore a kind of cradle of Russian civilization. He preceded the invasion of Ukraine with a speech fueled by historical animus, raging at the Bolshevik divisions of Russian lands while rejecting Ukraine’s de facto right to sovereignty.

“Though this grievance seems situated within what Putin has called the tragedy of the Soviet collapse, his imperial inspiration extends even deeper into the country’s past,” wrote Lynne Hartnett, a historian of Russia at Villanova University, in The Washington Post. “As Putin described it in a 2012 speech, the revival of Russian national consciousness necessitates that Russians connect to their past and realize that they have ‘a common, continuous history spanning over 1,000 years.’ ”

Others pointed to historical legacies Putin may not welcome. “Like Putin, Peter wanted to build Russian military power, and not only reformed his army but built his navy, just as Putin spent 20 years modernizing his military,” wrote Mark Galeotti in the Spectator. “In the process, though he began the Russian state’s slide into insolvency and ensured it would be fighting wars not just to its north-west but also to the south, against the Ottomans.”

Russia is, of course, not the only country where ruling nationalists get swept away by such grievance. Hungary’s illiberal Prime Minister Viktor Orban grumbles about the borders delineated by the World War I Treaty of Trianon and the loss of a “greater Hungary” in the surrounding Balkans. Turkish nationalists, meanwhile, lament the Treaty of Sèvres, which tore up the defeated Ottoman Empire and shrunk the Turkish footprint in the Middle East. Hindu nationalists in India conjure up the idea of “Akhand Bharat,” a united Indian subcontinent defined by the historic reach of Hindu culture.

Political scientists would classify these urges as “revanchist” or “irredentist,” with politicians whipping up their supporters with rhetoric about lands lost and brethren communities separated by unjust borders. But Putin’s revanchism, unlike that of most other right-wing nationalists elsewhere, now has provoked a geopolitical conflagration and has a growing body count underlying it.

Putin’s critics point to his explicit embrace of Peter the Great’s conquests as evidence of the foolhardiness of offering concessions to the Kremlin now. The war, they argue, was not about NATO expansion or a farcical belief in the need to “denazify” Kyiv, but the uncompromising zeal of a 21st century imperialist.

“Putin’s confession of land seizures and comparing himself with Peter the Great prove there was no ‘conflict’, only the country’s bloody seizure under contrived pretexts of people’s genocide,” tweeted Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the Ukrainian government. “We should not talk about [Russia] ‘saving face’, but about its immediate de-imperialization.”

One need look no further than Poltava, site of Peter’s famous victory over Sweden but now a place that’s within Ukraine. Local authorities there have not welcomed Putin’s invasion. Instead, a court in the Poltava region last month found a pair of detained Russian soldiers guilty of committing war crimes.",37377b7faff31697fb02be2906ace5b267d20381,True,False,,,,,0,1655118243,,0,{},ic6v4ye,True,t3_vb9kl0,False,True,t3_vb9kl0,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vb9kl0/putin_makes_his_imperial_pretensions_clear/ic6v4ye/,1655118260,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655089443.0,

This is no time for western resolve to ebb over Ukraine

Leaders should unite around Zelenskyy’s framework for military aims

The editorial board 		 		


The mood in Kyiv is darkening. The euphoria of a few weeks ago when Russian forces seemed on the retreat has turned to unease over what has become a punishing war of attrition in east Ukraine. A note of disquiet has crept into the speeches of the indefatigable president Volodymyr Zelenskyy that western support could ebb or fracture, or that its leaders might push his country into an unacceptable peace. Some 108 days into the war, it is more vital than ever that Kyiv’s allies remain united and resolute in their actions, and their messaging. First, that means stepping up arms deliveries. The US and UK are providing multiple-launch rocket systems capable of firing up to 50 miles, after receiving assurances they would not be used to strike inside Russia itself. Kyiv says it needs at least 60 — far more than pledged — to have a chance of turning the tide in the war. A $40bn US support package includes $19bn of near-term military aid, but deliveries will take time. Ukraine needs more arms now to repel Russian forces that, by concentrating troops and long-range artillery in strategic spots, are finally grinding out advances — but may struggle to sustain such tactics indefinitely. Just as important is resolve and consistency in allies’ diplomacy. It is prudent in security terms to avoid driving into a corner a paranoid Russian leader who has broken taboos on threatening to use nuclear weapons. But French President Emmanuel Macron’s insistence that the west must not “humiliate” Russia sounds dangerously pusillanimous. Vladimir Putin, whose forces are maiming and killing Ukrainians, deserves no help in saving face. Germany and Italy have also called for a ceasefire as a path to a negotiated settlement. Ukraine’s president fears a repeat of 2014, when Kyiv was pushed to accept a deal that cemented Russia’s territorial gains in the east. In a Financial Times interview, Zelenskyy set out a legitimate framework for his military aims. A stalemate leaving Russian forces where they are, he said, was “not an option for us”. It should be unacceptable, too, for Kyiv’s allies; tolerating Putin’s Ukrainian land grabs through force, for a second time, might only embolden him to use aggression elsewhere. Zelenskyy specified that repelling Russia’s army to positions before its February 24 invasion would be a “serious temporary victory”, but restoring full sovereignty over its territory remains Kyiv’s ultimate goal. Volodymyr Zelenskyy: ‘No one is humiliating Ukraine. They are killing us’ Without directly discussing borders, US president Joe Biden has also set out a position more robust than Macron’s, and not inconsistent with that of Zelenskyy. The US will not press Kyiv to make territorial concessions. It wants a “democratic, independent, sovereign and prosperous Ukraine” that can deter future aggression. But it will not try to “bring about [Putin’s] ouster”, or encourage or enable Ukraine to strike beyond its borders. While some may privately differ, western leaders ought to be able to unite around these frameworks — and use them as a guide in all contacts with Russia’s Putin. Above all, they should respect the principle of deciding “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine”. After western allies chose, for understandable reasons, not to intervene directly in the war, Ukraine is fighting alone. It is defending not only its own sovereignty but, by extension, freedom and security in Europe. How far it thinks it can go in prosecuting its aims will be determined in no small part by the support it can secure from its partners. They should equip it with all means possible without triggering a direct conflict with Russia. It is then for Kyiv to determine the timing and terms of any peace talks with Moscow. This editorial has been amended to clarify that French President Emmanuel Macron said the international community should avoid humiliating Russia, not Vladimir Putin",61975b8e6bb0ed831578b3c03b04dff4ac00961c,True,False,,,,,0,1655115058,,0,{},ic6r70o,True,t3_vb8rvt,False,True,t3_vb8rvt,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/vb8rvt/this_is_no_time_for_western_resolve_to_ebb_over/ic6r70o/,1655115072,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1655086258.0,

Here is a google translated part of what she says:

&gt;**Another accusation made against you by ""servants"" is about an open letter recently written to you by the media . Please pay attention to the vocabulary you use to describe Russian sexual crimes against Ukrainians .**  
  
When I saw this appeal in the media, I offered to meet with everyone who wanted to, to talk to me personally. The conversation took place - someone joined directly, someone - online.  
  
I argued - and the media agreed with me - why we need to talk about war crimes. Because when, for example, I spoke in the Italian parliament at the Committee on International Affairs, I heard and saw such fatigue from Ukraine, you know? I talked about terrible things in order to somehow push them to make the decisions that Ukraine and the Ukrainian people need. There ( in Italy - SK ) there is a party ""Five Stars"", which was against the provision of weapons to us, but after my speech, one of the party leaders expressed support for Ukraine, said that they will support, including the provision weapons.  
  
I told the media word for word what was told to me by psychologists who worked on the UNICEF psychological support line, which has already completed its work - May 15 was the last day. I conveyed everything that the applicants wanted to say to society and the world; that the enemies, the Russian Federation, be punished. Yes, then this vocabulary was very harsh, we discussed it ( with the media. - SK ), I said that, indeed, maybe I exaggerated. But I tried to achieve the goal of convincing the world to provide weapons and pressure ( on Russia. - SK). I met with Pramila Patten, the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict - we work according to UN protocols and clearly to PACE, UN Human Rights Council resolutions, which clearly state what sexual violence is.  
  
Today it is used systematically, constantly and in special cruelty, this is the tactics of the war of the Russian Federation.

Tetra Pak wants to continue selling to Russia, however, saying it's because of humanitarian reasons. I just woke up and am recently wrapping my head around this, so I might have misunderstood something, but some take-aways...;

1) Tetra Pak has given all proceeds from Russia to Ukraine, meaning their sale in Russia has been nothing but a definitive loss (i.e. philantrophy)

2) Tetra Pak says they think of the children as the people that will be hit the hardest; no more Tetra Pak might be annoying to adults in Russia but depressing to children

Tetra Pak requested to have their company exempt from sanctions, but the Swedish Kommerskollegium (commerce college, the governing body) said no because they (Tetra Pak) were unable to prove that it was because of humanitarian reasons. So, they say nothing about Tetra Pak per se, only saying that in a judicial sense there isn't enough reason to exclude them from sanctions.

Tetra Pak has a russian subsidiary, Joint Stock Company Tetra Pak, but apparently they receive material and such from Sweden, so this effectively will shut down Tetra Pak. However, they've still told Russian newspaper Ria Novosti that they will continue to operate independently from Swedish Tetra Pak.

Tetra Pak in Sweden's communications chief Eva Rodlich said:

&gt;*”Vi utvärderar nu vilka möjligheter beslutet ger för oss att överklaga. Vi vidhåller förstås vår uppfattning att ett stopp av exporten kommer få konsekvenser utifrån ett humanitärt perspektiv.”*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""We now evaluate what different possibilities the decision gives us for appealing. We maintain our perception that a stop of the export will have consequences in a humanitarian perspective.""

Another concern with Tetra Pak being banned from exporting things to its subsidiary in Russia is that the company may be expropriated by the Russian state, giving Russians technology and means that they do not currently have and potentially boosting its production capacity; in direct contradiction of the purpose of the sanctions (to reduce Russian production capacity).

At first, I'd think, hey, it's a scummy company. But then I realized that at face-value, if they're already donating all proceeds from the Russian subsidiary to Ukraine, then that's unlikely. So, as usual, it's rarely black on white and always some shades of grey (at my guess). But I haven't really looked into it that deep; all I know is that Nordic companies usually are not very decadent or hardcore capitalist (like LEGO or whatever).

The second top comment about a Russian version appearing is probably the most realistic result. It might ironically boost the Russian market.

Discrimination and Intolerance  
'Official statistics published in May showed an increase in politically motivated crimes in 2020, particularly hate crimes carried out by right-wing extremists. Anti-immigrant and antisemitic crimes increased by 72 and almost 16 percent, respectively, over the previous year. In August, Germany's Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency published figures showing a 78 percent increase in calls reporting a racist incident in 2020.

German President Steinmeier condemned an increase in attacks on Jewish institutions in German cities following the escalation in conflict between Israel and Palestine in May.'

An April report commissioned by the European Commission found a considerable increase in online antisemitic hate speech during the Covid-19 pandemic. In the first two months of 2021 alone, the study recorded a thirteen-fold increase in antisemitic comments in German compared to the same period in 2020.

The June report by an independent commission set up by the German Bundestag in 2019 found that the effects of the Nazi genocide and the failure to counter anti-Roma racism are still evident today with discrimination in public spheres including education, social services, and policing.

4043,[],False,,EndWarByMasteringIt,,,[],,,,text,t2_kfhwjc57,False,False,"One thing we take for granted in democracies is the value of human life.  There are various attempts by different countries to quantify this, the best of which may be a modified version of the US' dialysis standard: one year of (quality) life is worth two years of average income.  For wealthy countries, this gives really immense values of life - US value of life is $8-10M per person, or $129k per YOL.

One might argue ethics or morality in here, but fundamentally there has to be such a value for both insurance and public policy.  If you're spending $500,000 to put in a guardrail along a road, or $1,000,000 on a surgical operation, is it worth it?

Non-democracies generally do not have a value of life.  The 30,000 dead 20-year-olds russia has, with their USD$10k annual GDP and 50 years of life remaining, would be worth USD$30 billion.  But there is no value of life in russia, so their value there is $0.

During times of crisis the value of life cannot be maintained.  We saw democracies *completely* struggle with this during the pandemic.  The loss of value-of-life we did suffer (1 million US lives cut ~10 years short at ~$129k per year) was immense; the potential loss of letting covid rip as poorer countries did would have been many times higher.  It lead to intense arguments as ultra-conservatives across those democracies pushed the narrative that life does not have value.  Of course, valuing the lives of citizens is arguably the single biggest draw of democracies, so generally we struggled through it.

'Experiences and perceptions of antisemitism Second survey on discrimination and hate crime against Jews in the EU Factsheet – Germany' FRA European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights 

Excerpt:

""Antisemitism in Germany today is just like it was 30 years ago. For the past 12 years, antisemitism has no longer been a taboo in Germany, and so it occurs more often – verbally and physically, on German streets and in social media.” (Woman, 60–69 years old, Germany)

'Europe’s Worrying Surge of Antisemitism - Protect European Jews and Uphold Right to Peaceful Protest' Benjamin Ward Deputy Director, Europe and Central Asia Division May 17 2021 

Upper case letters added for emphasis:

""A Rabbi attacked in the street. A synagogue daubed with a swastika. Hate shouted from a loudspeaker in a Jewish neighborhood.  
These are only a few of the alarming incidents of antisemitic hatred witnessed in Europe last weekend, including in the UK, GERMANY AND AUSTRIA. As Jewish groups have been warning, antisemitism is on the rise again in Europe. ...'

2019 'The New German Anti-Semitism - For the nation’s estimated 200,000 Jews, new forms of old hatreds are stoking fear'

Excerpt:

' ... According to a 2015 Anti-Defamation League survey, 51 percent of Germans believe that it is “probably true” that “Jews still talk too much about what happened to them in the Holocaust”; 30 percent agreed with the statement “People hate Jews because of the way Jews behave.”

...

'The reactionary, far-right Alternative for Germany, or A.f.D., entered the German Parliament for the first time in 2017 — becoming the third-largest party — with an anti-immigration, anti-Islam platform, while politicians in the party also railed against Germany’s remembrance culture. 

A.f.D. politicians have often relativized Nazi crimes to counteract what some of them call a national “guilt cult.” In a speech last June, one of the party’s leaders, Alexander Gauland, referred to the Nazi period as “only a bird poop in over 1,000 years of successful German history.” ...'

' In a 2018 European Union survey of European Jews, 85 percent of respondents in Germany characterized anti-Semitism as a “very big” or “fairly big” problem; 89 percent said the problem has become worse in the last five years. 

Overall reported anti-Semitic crimes in Germany increased by nearly 20 percent last year to 1,799, while violent anti-Semitic crimes rose by about 86 percent, to 69. 

Police statistics attribute 89 percent of all anti-Semitic crimes to right-wing extremists, but Jewish community leaders dispute that statistic, and many German Jews perceive the nature of the threat to be far more varied. 

Slightly more than half of Germany’s Jewish respondents to the E.U. survey said they have directly experienced anti-Semitic harassment within the last five years, and of those, the plurality, 41 percent, perceived the perpetrator of the most serious incident to be “someone with a Muslim extremist view.”

Vladimir Putin’s annual economic forum in St. Petersburg was always a hot ticket for Russian and foreign business tycoons eager to curry favor with the Kremlin by hosting glitzy parties or announcing major investments. His invasion of Ukraine has made it a radioactive one.

Many business leaders are concerned about even being seen at this year’s St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, fearful it may make them targets for sanctions, three people familiar with the situation said, declining to be identified because the issue is sensitive. At least two executives said they plan to leave early to avoid attending Putin’s speech at the event, which in past years was the highlight for the well-connected. 

Some have asked the organizers, Roscongress, not to identify them on their badges at the June 15-18 SPIEF forum, the people said. Roscongress didn’t respond to requests to comment.

Even as Russia contends with unprecedented international sanctions that threaten its deepest economic recession in decades, officials are projecting a business-as-usual approach for the 25th anniversary event under the slogan of “new opportunities in a new world.” 

The confrontation with the West that has escalated at times to warnings of nuclear war gets barely a mention on SPIEF’s website, though foreign visitors are told to bring cash since sanctions mean Mastercard and Visa bank cards issued outside Russia won’t work there.

Russia used previous forums to “demonstrate the success of the country” while business leaders could show they have “connections and money,” said Ekaterina Schulmann, a political scientist and fellow at Germany’s Robert Bosch Academy who moderated discussion panels at last year’s SPIEF. This year, “if domestic participants don’t all want to demonstrate their participation, then foreign ones even more so,” said Schulmann, who’s been labeled a “foreign agent” by the Kremlin.

Before the war, Russian tycoons and state-run companies competed to out-do each other by flying in entertainers like Sting and Robbie Williams, whose “Party Like a Russian” song caught the extravagant mood of SPIEF’s late-night scene. Most of the same tycoons and companies are now under US and European Union sanctions and few parties are planned this time.

Putin’s flagship event once attracted global political figures such as French President Emmanuel Macron, Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This time, it’s hosting an Afghan Taliban representative, according to the Tass news service, the investment minister from Myanmar’s military government and the head of Venezuela’s central bank, all heavily-sanctioned countries.

Officials from Egypt, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the Central African Republic are also attending, as well as from former Soviet republics. Even so, the number of foreign representatives is a fraction of those at past SPIEFs.

Despite their governments’ sanctions on Russia, leaders of business organizations in Moscow representing France, Italy, Canada and the US are listed by SPIEF’s organizers as taking part. An American Chamber of Commerce in Russia spokeswoman confirmed its participation.

Putin didn’t mention what he calls Russia’s “special military operation” in a greeting letter to participants that blamed “mistakes of Western countries” for surging global inflation, disruption to supply chains and food shortages. 

Understanding the Roots of Russia’s War in Ukraine: QuickTake

But what he dubbed the “difficult time” in relations is reflected in much of SPIEF’s program. Panels are dominated by Russian officials with few foreigners, and cover topics such as protecting “national media sovereignty” and boosting consumer and business patriotism in import substitution efforts.

Some previously prominent names at SPIEF are adopting a lower profile. Russia’s largest lender, sanctioned state-run Sberbank PJSC, won’t host its traditional party at the forum, two people familiar said. 

Sanctioned billionaire Oleg Deripaska appeared to rule out his participation, saying the issue was “finally decided” in a June 8 Telegram post of cherry trees laden with fruit. “It’s time to gather the harvest,” said Deripaska, who often spends time in his native agricultural Krasnodar region of southern Russia.

One program highlight is Gazprom head Alexey Miller, a rare speaker at past forums, who’ll join a session on the global gas market, according to SPIEF.

The forum’s high cost at 960,000 rubles ($16,600) per person is causing some to skip the event because it makes less business sense with many international companies no longer in attendance, executives of two big industrial firms said.

“No senior executive of a foreign company will want to be photographed at SPIEF this year,” said Chris Weafer, chief executive officer of Macro-Advisory Ltd.

There is also the cost of the ongoing service, which SpaceX has waived for the last 5 months (at least $100 per month per unit). And then there is the fact that the starlinks were originally priced at a loss, with the goal to make up for it down the road with higher efficiencies. So the retail price does not reflect the true cost to SpaceX.

Then you said Musk wants to remove Twitter moderation. That isn’t true. The goal is less capricious, politically one-sided moderation, and more transparency about how moderation decisions are made. And also a war on bots (one of the main ways to spread propaganda) to cut down on them dramatically. Will it make Twitter a better place? I don’t know, but it is false to say the goal is to remove it.

I agree with you about one thing. We keep giving Musk credit for things that an entire company does.

In addition, Tetra Pak said in its appeal that the interruption of exports may not have the consequences that Western countries expect - Russia will have ""access to technologies that it does not have now.""

&gt; However, the council disagreed with the company and refused permission.

1.  I am US citizen so this “me doing this to Ukrainians” comes from a perspective of NATO doing this to Ukrainians. Which I think is horrible and hold NATO accountable for misleading Ukraine and fanning the flames of Russian reprisal.

2. I think the bay of pigs was wrong on BOTH sides and I think Ukraine is wrong on BOTH sides.  And in both cases it is the Cuban and Ukrainian people who are caught in the crossfire of Geopolitical military industrial complex dick waving.

To me geopolitical “alliances” are bad and you know who also thought so.

George fucking Washington though so too.

“ The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is in extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little political connection as possible. So far as we have already formed engagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us stop. Europe has a set of primary interests which to us have none; or a very remote relation. Hence she must be engaged in frequent controversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns. Hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves by artificial ties in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics, or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships or enmities.

Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a different course. If we remain one people under an efficient government. the period is not far off when we may defy material injury from external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will cause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously respected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making acquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us provocation; when we may choose peace or war, as our interest, guided by justice, shall counsel.

Why forego the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own to stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor or caprice?

It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world; so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty to do it; for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing infidelity to existing engagements. I hold the maxim no less applicable to public than to private affairs, that honesty is always the best policy. I repeat it, therefore, let those engagements be observed in their genuine sense. But, in my opinion, it is unnecessary and would be unwise to extend them.”

I was thinking of trying to refute this incomprehensible diatribe of yours, but Jesus. The word salad here is some of the worst I've ever seen. Your post is both simultaneously a self refutation and a monumental self own.

It's almost as if you looked at a Wikipedia article, grabbed a bunch of words from the table of contents, and shook them up in a Scrabble tile back and spilled them out onto a table.

Imports meanwhile, some of which are subject to Western sanctions, are down by 20%. The net result is a trade balance for the past three months nearly four times higher than a year before.

Poland and the baltics would be likely to face conventional missile attacks from Kakiningrad and couldn't risk a ground Invasion due to the risk of Russia using nukes if such an invasion was successful and threatened to capture nukes stationed there. 

Kaliningrad is a major problem for NATO trying to flex any direct muscles. The best long game there would be covert operations to stir up popular unrest there. Kaliningrad citizens are way more connected to Europe than other Russians, both economically and culturally. Before this war, they were used to free and quick travel to Poland, Germany, and elsewhere. Now that is abruptly over and flights from there to mainland Russia are twice as long and four times as expensive due to having to fly a bizarre route to avoid allied airspace over the baltic. 

If Kaliningrad eventually revolted and expressed Interest in independence, Russia has no good options there. They would probably try to put down a revolt with overwhelming force, but that would require naval landings, airdrops, or movement thru countries who wouldn't allow it. Its a situation where any leader less brutal and insane than Putin would likely say it isn't worth it.

I don't know, but **Wikipedia says**:





Masculinity (also called manhood or manliness) is a set of attributes, behaviors, and roles associated with men and boys. Masculinity can be understood as socially constructed, and there is also evidence that some behaviors considered masculine are influenced by both cultural factors and biological factors. To what extent masculinity is biologically or socially influenced is subject to debate. It is distinct from the definition of the biological male sex, as anyone can exhibit masculine traits. Standards of masculinity vary across different cultures and historical periods.

So by that logic you have every right to go back and take all the African colonies back since they 'weren't countries' when you colonized and imperially invaded them? I guess since the East coast of the US was part of the UK before the US was a country the UK would have a right to steal it back by your logic as well. 

France's invasion and annexation of German speaking lands inhabited by Germanic peoples was completely unjustifiable and what instigated German unification and the Franco-Prussian war.

I'm aware of *that* understanding. My point is that doing both successions to NATO in sequence (rather than literally simultaneously) does no violence to that understanding between Sweden and Finland. And trying to interpret that understanding more tightly (to rule out such a sequence) gives more leverage to assholes, like Erdogan, or Russia.

&gt; Furthermore, basically being forced to give up our sovereignty to Turkey is making a lot of Swedes/Finns who were in favour of the applications before change their minds. 

That's a pretty big overstatement. Turkey is demanding bullshit (and nonspecific!) concessions, but it's hard to see how overcoming them either by concession, negotiation (something in the middle), or calling Turkey's bluff, and ultimately joining NATO, will be ""being forced to give up [your] sovereignty""

&gt; Finland's President even said they wouldn't have applied, had they known what Turkey would do.

*****
&gt; Ukrainians flee Russian filtration camps During Olena&amp;#039;s interrogation, she recalled how a guard questioning a man at the next table found a keyring bearing the image of the Ukrainian coat of arms.

&gt; Ukrainians fleeing Mariupol by bus often arrive at the filtration camps unknowingly, having been told they would be taken to Ukrainian-held cities instead. After arrival, they are usually not allowed to leave the town.

&gt; Others report a shorter wait time, with some Ukrainians spending only a day or two at the camps before filtration and onward travel to Russia.

Jordan is already a home for Palestinians. All they have to do is replace the Hashemite king. The West Bank was actually annexed by Jordan illegally.

""With the Transjordan memorandum to the Mandate for Palestine in the early 1920s, it became the Emirate of Transjordan under the Hashemite Emir. In 1946, independent Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan was formed and shortly admitted to the United Nations and the Arab League. In 1948, Jordan fought with the newly born state of Israel over lands of former Mandatory Palestine, effectively gaining control of the West Bank and annexing it with its Palestinian population. Jordan lost the West Bank in the 1967 War with Israel, and since became the central base of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in its struggle against Israel.""

Wrong, all the promises Germany has done to Ukraine have been fullfilled or are in the procces of beeing fullfilled. These promises you are probably thinking about are about military contractors saying they could deliver old heavy equipment to Ukraine from their stock after refurbishment. Even then they are not promises by them. The government has no control over this old vehicles and can't promise them since they are not their own.  
I could give you are source but since you are beeing so ambigous with what you are saying and also are not providing a source I won't since that would take too long when I don't know what specificly you mean and I would have to provide multiple to cover everything.

&gt;Macron has been accused by Zelensky of privately pressuring Ukraine to concede territory.

Once again, you could have provided a source for your aguement. Now I could find a few articles that state this happenend. But none actually show the interview. What we know is that Macron back then acted as an intermediary between Zelensky and Putin and informed each other of their demands, which would be to cede territory from Putin.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The comment above suggested that they plan to announce a change in   
policy in support of Kyiv, when history and context suggest the   
opposite.

What history? You have shown two arguements, one of which was blatantly false to support your aguement that they are in fact NOT supporting Ukraine while ignoring all the arguement why they ARE supporting Ukraine.

[Like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_foreign_aid_to_Ukraine_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War) the [2 Billion Dollar](https://www.tf1info.fr/international/guerre-ukraine-russie-avec-300-millions-en-plus-la-france-va-porter-son-aide-globale-a-l-ukraine-a-2-milliards-de-dollars-2218842.html)s send by France, [500M in loans with a billion in Guarantees](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-economy/3400470-france-to-provide-eur-12b-in-program-funding-for-ukraines-development-presidents-office.html). [France beeing the largest arms export to Ukraine between 2014 and 2020](https://www.nzz.ch/international/ukraine-krise-was-der-westen-kiew-an-waffen-geliefert-hat-ld.1666637). And much more from weapons to humatarian aid that I could spend another 2 hours sending you sources why they SUPPORT Ukraine.

Germany has given [1.83B € as bilateral aid to Ukraine since 2014. Has given Ukraine approx. 4B € via the EU, 240M € via loans in 2022](https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/politik/ukraine-deutschland-hilfen-100.html). [1B € aid for Ukraine to spend on military weapons](https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/scholz-ukraine-militaerhilfe-101.html) (We can't send much hardware, but we can send them the money to buy said hardware) plus an additional 1B in form of grants (would like to give you a source but that would be a reuters source which would be blocked here, I am sure you can find it). 

Then they also send tons of weapons, mine, medical equipment and other anti-tank weapons, massively reduced their dependance on Russian oil,gas and coal, but once again I don't have all night.

&amp;#x200B;

So I ask you, does this look like they aren't supporting Ukraine. Why would they spend BILLIONS upon BILLIONS on Ukraine and on getting the infrastructure in place to get rid of russia as a source of energy if they aren't supporting Ukraine.

There is an overwhelming majority of arguements that they are supporting Ukraine. So I ask you, do you stay with your poorly sourced claim and reject reality or do you maybe realise that you maybe where wrong.

Before this gets brought up, yes, I acknowledge Ukraine has agency and the right to pursue membership in whatever organization they want as a sovereign state.

I assure you realists like Mearsheimer/Walt take no joy in being right. His book is called *The* ***Tragedy*** *of Great Power Politics*.

And nothing in the actions that I have seen of Russian leadership suggests that they are willing to take any personal risks. Allowing civil debate about the war, calling it a war, publishing casualty figures, issuing mobilization orders, and sending more residents of Moscow and St Petersburg to the front lines instead of minorities or separatists are all actions taken to avoid personal risk. Threatening nuclear war is not a personal risk because they know they can threaten nuclear war all day and nothing will happen. Actually using nukes, though, that represents a very real personal risk to them.
