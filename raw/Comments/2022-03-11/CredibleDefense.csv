This is really the truth about Russian equipment.

Usually on paper, it all seems really good. But then when someone actually gets to use it, it turns out it is not as good as western equipment. AK-74 vs m4. Big debate there about which is better. No debate that the optics US forces get is WAY better than the optics on an average AK-74. 

Even their new ak-12 comes with a mediocre optics compared to a ACOG, red dot, or holographic. US forces have a choice too. 

The same story with the Mig-29. Seemed like a great plane, but it came up short when seeing how it integrated with other combat systems or the avionics. 

I think what happens in Russian culture is some general sees the shit that the US has. Then they tell the engineers to make it, and the engineer slaps together something that does sort of what the western world does in a half-assed manner by copying it.

I mean, these problems have been fixable for the past three decades. The only thing is that fixing these problems requires actually investing into fixing them. However, the instant you invest into anything in Russia you run into an obvious problem. Everyone involved wants a cut of the action, so by the time you get down to doing things a lot of the money, equipment, and other resources have already been directed into the pockets of the various people involved. It's not just a military thing, this is just how business is done in Russia.

I always remember a story told to me by a relative in the mid-2000s. The guy was in one of the top business schools in Moscow, and they had a president of a major investment firm come in to give a lecture on the appropriate bribe amounts based on the position of the person they were bribing, down to the level of proper etiquette based on the currency the bribe was in. It was literally institutionalized corruption presented in the clearest way possible. This wasn't some under the table discussion with a wink-wink, nudge-nudge; it was literally a lecture given in class explaining the bribe structure of the country.

When you have a culture which ensures that only a fraction of the funding meant for a task is actually used towards it, what sort of hope is there that the goals of the task can be accomplished? Fixing the problem means first fixing the culture, but if they could fix the culture then they would have much less need for such military action. Let's be honest, if Russia wasn't the type of corrupt shit-hole that it is right now then it could be a reasonable contender on the world stage in a lot of areas, and it probably wouldn't need to throw military force around in order to prevent their closest neighbors from joining a competing military alliance or financial block.",fb0862b08934dc7ff316107808f484db4d880b23,True,False,,,,,0,1647038674,,0,{},i0au2dc,False,t3_tbx9bb,False,True,t3_tbx9bb,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tbx9bb/russian_military_performance_in_ukraine_shows/i0au2dc/,1647038692,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647009874.0

In WW2, a tank could take a command of a field in a way nothing else could. Anti tank guns are slow and vulnerable while being set up. Man-portable anti-tank weapons had maximum ranges of under 300 meters. The only things you could realistically do to dislodge the tank was your own tank, or sheer bloody numbers. 

The answer to ""Why do I want a tank?"" was abundantly clear to anyone who saw how they operated.

The issue I see modernly is range and mobility are no longer issues for anti-tank weaponry. Javelins outrange all weaponry a tank has, and all the weapons the screening infantry have to defend it. Unlike earlier generation systems like TOW, javelins are fire and forget and have considerably less setup. 

Tanks have never been invulnerable, but I don't think they've ever been *this* vulnerable at all ranges and at all times before.

▪️ The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, continuing the offensive on a wide front, reached the line novodonetskoye - Novomayorskoye - EGOROVKA. The advance was 11 kilometers.

Destroyed: 121 unmanned aerial vehicles, 1067 tanks and other armored fighting vehicles, 114 multiple launch rocket systems, 412 field artillery and mortars, 862 units of special military vehicles.

So, yesterday in the Kherson region, the next Igla MANPADS were seized.

[],False,,Xyzzyzzyzzy,,,[],,,,text,t2_6qgej2g0,False,False,"A technical note on SAMs. In general SAMs can only target aircraft they have line-of-sight to, because their radars operate at UHF and above. For example, the S-400 has the 91N6E ""BIG BIRD"" S-band radar and 96L6E ""CHEESE BOARD"" C-band radar, both are line-of-sight only. The 40N6E missile is supposedly capable of engaging targets below the horizon in active radar homing mode, but I would guess that's not a very reliable mode of engagement.

Take a look at this [horizon distance calculator](https://calculator.academy/horizon-distance-calculator/#f1p0) which will tell you how far away a target at X altitude (AGL) can be seen at by line-of-sight. An aircraft flying at a nice high 30,000 ft can be seen at 212 miles, which is close to the 250 mi maximum range of the 40N6E missile and out of range of the other missiles the S-400 fires. Bring that down to a nice low 2500 ft AGL and it can only be seen up to 60 miles away.

That means that if you're Ukraine and you want to use your aviation assets, for starters you'll need to fly low. The theoretical 250km engagement range of an S-400 firing at a high altitude target from Russian or Belarusian territory covers virtually the entire country of Ukraine. Keep it nice and low, though, and in theory you could fly ground attack missions at much of the current front line, especially near Kyiv and in the south. You'll need to either engage when Russian tactical air defenses are switched off, or destroy or suppress them with ground forces, but that's certainly possible.

But that brings us back around to the other problem. A MiG-29 flying at 2500 ft AGL is a juicy target for modern MANPADS, and at this point Ukraine may not have a reliable way of telling everyone in a certain sector to switch off their MANPADS during a designated time period. So even if you fully suppress Russian tactical air defenses, there's a high risk of friendly fire incidents.",c82ad0a170c6cfdab46ff84c660f4e5fecd406cd,True,False,,,,,0,1647031500,,0,{},i0acspr,False,t3_tbpitt,False,True,t1_i0a80nt,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tbpitt/ukraine_megathread_march_11/i0acspr/,1647031511,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647002700.0

This is the crux of the problem. How do you detect that gaussian?

I mean no offense to your expertise, but the analogy to 2d motion tracking isn't a good one. Motion tracking algorithms use feature tracking, these days typically with automatic feature recognition. You can't do quite the same thing with acoustic data. This was exactly my point in talking about how you need some a priori known feature to grab onto that allows for the time difference of arrival calculation. Transients like explosions work for that, but the kind of gaussian mush that comes out of a jet engine does not.

Here's modern machine learning in one sentence: it's just layers of nonlinear regression. That's all that's going on. Exactly what architectures of layering work best for particular applications is still something of a dark art found by trial and error.

But in any case, ML isn't magical, it can't pull a signal out of an aggregate if the signal doesn't have any prior known salient features.

AWS and it's capabilities doesn't really have a bearing on this.

There's nothing particularly great to grab onto to make a matching filter to detect this out of the noise, and no transient to use for relative phase determination across the phased array.

Like I said, I am musing about it from a general DSP background doing stuff like film post production, not any deep expertise in the sound of jet engines.  But, if you have X microphones scattered around and you detect and correlate a jet-like sound, you do get things like doppler shift to drive your tracking estimates.

If listener 1 has a gaussian noise centered on X Hz, listener 2 nearby detects one centered at X+5 Hz, and listener 3 detects X - 5 Hz, you may be able to use the change in that doppler shift over time to say that it's clearly moving towards 2 and away from 3.  If the estimated trajectory based on doppler and delta doppler is &gt; 100 MPH, and &lt; 2000 MPH, it might be an aircraft.  If you've got some sort of 3D arrangement of listeners on hills, buildings, poles, trees, and on the ground, you may be able to differentiate noise sources that are above ground vs. on the ground.

I rather emphatically don't have any deep understanding of modern machine learning techniques, but a lot of this seems like the sort of stuff that modern machine learning techniques may be able to chew through well enough to get surprisingly good estimates.  Generate a bunch of synthetic training data, rent a zillion dollars worth of GPU's on AWS for a day, and it might work.

Perhaps the ""rent a zillion dollars worth of GPU's in AWS and see if it works"" is the real tech innovation that wasn't historically available.  It might work.  It might not.  But finding out would historically require an insane R&amp;D facility with a huge tech team.  The real innovation might not be in DSP algorithms or anything like that, so much as the AWS business model where you can spin up an insanely large experiment in an afternoon and get some preliminary results without a long term strategic commitment in the budget.

&gt; Russian military performance in Ukraine shows glaring weaknesses in their training and culture, but many of their failings are fixable.

&gt; Analysts have followed Russia’s 14 years of military modernisation with concern, tracking the development of a range of systems that technically outmatch many Western counterparts. It became a cliché in military circles to append analysis of Russian military modernisation and emerging concepts with the caveat that its soldiers were not 10 foot tall. The abysmal performance of the Russian military in its invasion of Ukraine has laid bare just how wide the theory–praxis gap is. While this should lead to a recalibration of assessments of Russian capability, however, it is important that analysts do not over-correct.

[],False,,ChimpdenEarwicker,,,[],,,,text,t2_541e3z,False,False,"&gt; So the first question is whether the MBT is obsolete? There's no alternative weapon system that allows you to break through the enemy lines and exploit the ground to the enemies rear the way you can in a tank so it absolutely has utility

Pretty much any armored fighting vehicle can do this depending on the circumstances right? In fact a lighter armored vehicle might have much more flexibility in maneuvering over bridges and such where a tank might be bottlenecked because it is so heavy. Also MBTs require so much logistical support (the fuel ALONE) that they are much more limited in their ability to exploit a break in enemy lines and penetrate deeply into enemy territory to cut off and encircle.

I think the question of whether the MBT is obsolete always gets sidetracked into a question of whether armored fighting vehicles are going to be obsolete and obviously that question is no.

I don't see how armored fighting vehicles equipped with ATGMs (especially if they can fire non-LOS using UAVs, video guidance or accompanying infantry for target acquisition) can't fulfill the above role. As ATGMs get more advanced the concept of a tank having a *direct fire 120mm cannon* as its main anti-armor weapon I think will increasingly come into question

&gt; Infantry weapons are a threat as well but active defenses are improving and going some way to mitigate that threat, the Israeli Trophy system seems to be fairly effective for example. 

I am sure active defenses will play an ever increasing role in armor but active defenses can be mounted on lighter armored vehicles and further how many incoming munitions can active defenses actually defeat? (simultaneously and in sequence). The game of active defenses differentiating between incoming ""dummy"" munitions and actually threatening ones seems like one that active defenses will always be behind on. Further, how fragile are those active defenses to battlefield wear, artillery and high caliber arms fire?

Looking more into APS it does seem they have been so far extremely effective, but couldn't you just fire two ATGMs, one a couple of seconds after the first? Definitely a harder thing to do, but I don't see how an APS could deal with two rockets incoming from the same direction one after another.",b8f056f5cc0f3d0e9c3824fab7ca8f06e357ff01,True,False,,,,,0,1647024022,,0,{},i09u2pw,False,t3_tbkt8t,False,True,t1_i08k3n2,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tbkt8t/are_mbts_going_the_way_of_battleships/i09u2pw/,1647024033,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646995222.0

[],False,,wrosecrans,,,[],,,,text,t2_a99kk,False,True,"I'm not qualified to evaluate finding airplanes acoustically.  Here's what my newsletter would say anyway.

I am kinda semi-qualified to talk about the absolutely bonkers phased array microphones in modern cheapo ""Alexa"" devices.  I am reasonably qualified to understand syncing timestamps across devices over wide area networks using stuff like NTP.  (I work in tech on distributed Internet backend stuff.)  And I am reasonably qualified to understand the DSP algorithms involved in correlating sounds from different microphones.  (I used to work in VFX, and the math for image tracking is basically just a 2D version of audio correlation.)

None of that is exactly my area of expertise.  But by ""some asshole writing comments on the Internet,"" standards I can at least get the general gist of those broad technologies.  In the 90's, it would have been pretty much impossible to think of a practical mechanism for deploying such a system.  Today...  You could probably write a cell phone app, and modern big data processing techniques could chew through audio from the cell phones and correlate it well enough to make some sort of virtual microphone phased array that can identify low flying jet engines and roughly what direction they are traveling.  But the R&amp;D that went into making all of that technology and hardware would have been absolutely insane to try and purpose-build for airplane detection.  Like, dozens of aircraft carriers worth of expense that couldn't be justified for national security.  But was completely justified for slightly shinier consumer goods.  The fact that the jet can move near the speed of sound makes that correlation math way funkier, but not intractably so.  You ultimately just get some extra lag in your data, as long as you can throw some math PhD's at it.  Good enough for detecting planes generally even if you can't precisely track them second to second, which might be good enough to be worth investing in such a system if your radar can't detect the planes at all.  ""Shot Spotter"" does something vaguely analogous scattering microphones around a community to detect gunshots, and then estimating exactly where the gunshot happened when it is detected.  It's not exactly the same, but it's certainly not unrelated to use a bunch of microphones to estimate a location of the sound source.

But in order to be detected, the jet engines probably need to get pretty close to the microphone.  I almost never hear jets overhead where I live, over the din of cars and leaf blowers.  An iPhone dropped in the woods would have a much lower noise floor to potentially pick up the noise of a jet.  But it's still not going to detect one from very long range.  So, cool if you know the enemy jets will be flying low, over a known path.  But that's a very narrow use case.

You can build big dishes to collect sound and use fancier microphones not built to only capture human voice frequencies.  The big dishes are awesome:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04F5osXK4vw  But now you've moved from the cost of each node being a free download to being potentially millions of dollars.  And while there are situations where you can scatter old cell phones every 100 meters along a flight path, it's much much harder to scatter big custom built listening hardware because your cost just went up _many_ orders of magnitude to go from rough theory to actually meeting military requirements.

So my best guess is that acoustic tracking of stealth aircraft is shockingly _possible._  And shockingly more practical now than it was 20 years ago.  But still hard to do in a really useful way, and not actually practical.  But like, don't be entirely shocked if there's a Hackaday post about somebody doing it anyway at some point.",658910c642a07abaeeaa70ece44f7c64e7cffb21,True,False,,,,,0,1647023003,,0,{},i09rfx2,False,t3_tb4vz7,False,True,t1_i09ii27,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tb4vz7/why_has_acoustic_detection_and_tracking_of/i09rfx2/,1647023017,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646994203.0

Just want to point out, that is not true.  


900k is for one thing, not their reservists, that is the number of active duty they claim. They claim to have another 2 million reservists on top of that. But, both of those are likely exaggerations... of course Russia wants everyone to think they have a massive military. But, if that were true they wouldn't be relying so much on conscripts, police, contractors, and now syrians.   


Second, even if those number were true, it is their entire forces combined, including air force, national guard, navy, janitors, warehouse workers, potato peelers, etc. The number of active duty soldiers is just about 280k, so they have actually activated well over half of their army forces.   


And thats not even to mention ""readiness"". The vast majority of their ""reservists"" could just be old men that haven't picked up a rifle in decades but are still considered reservists because they were conscripts once.

Imagine the US picking up a bunch of volunteers from the Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga and airlifting them to Taiwan to help fight a hot war there. It would be ridiculous, a waste of time. Whatever command and communications structures had been set up in Iraq for US and Kurdish forces to cooperate does not exist in Taiwan, the Kurds have no knowledge of the local language, customs or terrain, and they'd be fighting an enemy they're completely unfamiliar with who's equipped, trained and deployed in a way completely different from Daesh or Saddam's army or anything they're familiar with. They would be outside their familiar supply and replenishment networks and would have to learn, on the fly, in an active combat zone, how to interface with US Marine quartermasters. While they're familiar with some parts of the US kit and TTPs, I'm sure there's other parts they're less familiar with; would they be able to coordinate tactical movement with a Marine company by radio? 

And that's a best-case scenario! The Pesh is a fairly well organized, well disciplined, cohesive, professional-quality force. On the US side, even though we've been out of Iraq for a while, there's still some cultural goodwill and admiration for the Pesh.

My question is how many troops would it take to effectively encircle and deny supplies to Kyiv, a city of 325 square miles?

So I think at least early in the war the assumption that as Russia committed more forces they'd get their act together and become significantly more effective wasn't necessarily a bad one. Especially since the logistical challenges of an operation this size is so big. People assumed all top tier militaries to handle those challenges as well as the US, but I don't think people outside the field understand how committed the US military has been to logistics and how far ahead of everyone else they really are in that regard. So the experts anticipated some issues at least early on.

As Russia committed the bulk of its forces over the past week or so and the problems persisted, in hindsight it's clear those early issues were systemic rather than just the growing pains of a huge operation. That being said, Russia has improved those issues to some extent and are making gains, if incredibly slow, on multiple fronts. It's made a significant difference. Those gains are coming at a terrible price though, so it's starting to become an open question about whether they can sustain it with the forces on hand.

Ukraine has accused Russian aircraft of firing at a Belarusian settlement near the border from Ukrainian air space in an attempt to drag Belarus into the war in Ukraine.  
  
The Ukrainian air force said that at 2.30pm local time (12.30pm GMT), the state border service received information that Russian aircraft had taken off from an airfield in Belarus, crossed into Ukrainian air space and then fired at Kopani, a village in Belarus, reports Reuters.  
  
“This is a PROVOCATION! The goal is to involve the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus in the war with Ukraine!,” Ukraine’s Air Force Command said in an online statement.  
  
The Ukrainian military said that two other Belarusian settlements were also targeted in the operation.  
  
“We officially declare: the Ukrainian military has not planned and does not plan to take any aggressive action against the Republic of Belarus,” the security service said.

One of the big things is that there's no ready made replacement. The Tank was the answer to ""How do we get across an open field where there's machine gunners on the other side in cover?"" It also eventually became the answer to ""Now that horses are extremely easy to kill, what do we do for mobility on the battlefield?"" Both of those problems still largely exist - Men still die from machine guns and you still want battlefield mobility.

It should also be noted that the tank casualties in this war have been overstated. Per [Oryx excellent list](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html), a large percentage of total Russian tanks lost have been abandoned or captured. 64.1% of all tank loses are abandoned or captured. Among the gas guzzling T-80 models, this figure reaches 82.8%. 

We should also remember that seeing modernish tanks going up against the best anti-tank weapons in the world. Yes, Russia has been upgrading their T-72s and the plurality of destroyed tanks have been T-72B3 model 2016, pretty much their latest and greatest production tank. At the same time, the T-72 was first manufacturer in the late 1960s. It may just be that the T-72 is finally starting to show its age.

Can countermeasures be developed that help tanks? Maybe. I think now that the scale of the problem is extremely obvious, there's going to be plenty of money poured into systems that make tanks more survivable against AT missiles. The arrival of the SAM did not end the age of the jet fighter.

We're definitely going to see changes to the tank based on this conflict, but it'll still be around in some form or another.",e7aedfb1ca4c9d1cf941a0447011b69370de72a3,True,False,,,,,0,1647010715,,0,{},i08w0qh,False,t3_tbkt8t,False,True,t3_tbkt8t,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tbkt8t/are_mbts_going_the_way_of_battleships/i08w0qh/,1647010730,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646981915.0

Fundamentally, the Western Nations doubted Ukraine could be a solid partner in creating a modern military, so there has been tepid desire to invest time+treasure into the nation. Democracy has been messy, as well noted, in Ukraine over the last 20 years. 

The Belarusian outcome of zombie state certainly has looked likely for the Ukraine. Putin has played that hand in the seizure of the Crimea and thought it would work again in February 2022. Ukrainians appear to have voted otherwise. 

Zelenskyy seems to have done a very credible job into making Ukraine into a functional nation. That is certainly not him alone, but a national effort of a considerable part of the 44 million Ukrainians.

As well, the minimal investments from US, UK, Turkey and a few EU states in forging an evolving military seems to have paid off. As well, the breakaway provinces of Luhansk and Donbas have seen the Ukrainian Army operate in a manner of limited war, but in which the moral authority sits strongly on one side.

None of us should be confident on what the outcome of the war is now. I see parallels in the 1917-19 breakup of the Russian Empire (May it be less bloody…).

I think a lot of pundits had some idea it could drift towards something like Belarus.

But after a couple of years passed it was 2016, Trump was President and he wanted to extort the Ukrainians over aid to find political ammo to use against he Democrats.  You can also fill in with whatever conspiracy theories you might have about Trump and Putin contributing to delays or limitations on providing military aid to the Ukrainians.

There's maybe also the idea that nobody felt that Putin would more or less ignore a rational person's idea of risk relative to a full-blown invasion of Ukraine, so large scale re-arming of the Ukrainians was probably not seen as necessary and perhaps even destabilizing.  Plus if you factor in the risks of uncertainty about whether Ukraine could shift to a pro-Western, stable democracy versus becoming pro-Russia, you may not want to supply a lot of high tech Western gear that could get into Moscow's hands.

I think there's some argument to be made that if Hillary Clinton had beaten Trump, US Ukrainian policy would have been different and the US might have started a more intensive military aid package.  Even in this scenario, the question still might be how much up-arming of the Ukrainians could have been accomplished from 2018 on.   You need trained people for weapons systems, and it is/was a heavy lift to modernize an army.

Even if you assume they got a lot of new stuff and people trained on it, it's awfully fuzzy as to how much would have survived the initial strikes or been significant game changers.

Battleships didn't go away because of their vulnerability, they went away because they were obsolete. What's the point of ship that can hurl a shell 30 miles when you've got a plane that can fly a few hundred miles and drop a bomb with better accuracy?

So the first question is whether the MBT is obsolete? There's no alternative weapon system that allows you to break through the enemy lines and exploit the ground to the enemies rear the way you can in a tank so it absolutely has utility.

The last question is whether a tank's vulnerability makes it utility irrelevant and that will be long debated. The first thing is that no tank has ever been invincible so that's not the standard, they've only got to be hard to kill. The best anti-tank platform is an aircraft so having air superiority becomes very important when using a tank. Infantry weapons are a threat as well but active defenses are improving and going some way to mitigate that threat, the Israeli Trophy system seems to be fairly effective for example.

[],False,,Antique_Result2325,,,[],,,,text,t2_940py60c,False,False,"People talk about winning, losing, following consensus or being contrarian, but it's key to define objectives here.

It's clear a short term goal for Russia is to position troops to encircle off major cities, especially Kyiv. Being able to resupply this encirclement, stop resupply of Kyiv and repel Ukrainian counter-offenses is key. 

However does this mean Russia's goal is to then level Kyiv with artillery and then send in troops? Whilst that is their normal doctrine, 1) even this is a long strategy, and 2) how does this square with broader objectives?

I am no expert or mind reader, but it seems apparent the initial goal was a quick, much less bloody capture of Kyiv and key cities, ousting of the current government with a light touch puppet gov. Of course this sounds insane but from military strategy, speech prior to invasion and initial demands it seems likely.

Hence when we say Russia is winning we have to look at what is their operational objectives-- capture X major city, achieve air dominance, encircle Kyiv etc.

Whilst the air dominance thing is.. relatively humiliating, and everything else is subpar compared to expectations, the Russians are 100%-- if slowly-- moving towards that goal.

But why do they have these goals? Once they encircle Kyiv, even in the best case where they can either force a capitulation or simply capture it through force, it is still likely Ukraine will keep fighting, and even in the ""best case"" for Russia where they militarily take everything they want, holding it is a different beast entirely.

As a result, whilst I agree Russia is still making headway, if slow, on some key shorter-term objectives, all of this seems to be now for the end result of forcing favourable negotiation terms from Ukraine, as the idea of any wholesale long-term occupation of Ukraine is completely untenable

Right now, even if Russia were to resort to mass indiscriminate bombing, it would make any future negotiations even harder-- would have to force Ukraine to surrender if they wanted to exit militarily at all and not lose face, would still take weeks if not months and would face significant domestic and international backlash. This could entail increased protests domestically, more defections from troops, lower morale. Internationally we could see further sanctions such as a complete cut from SWIFT, further aid to Ukraine and also some ""netural"" countries such as China and India being put in a more awkward spot and (whilst still not being too anti-Russia) further distancing themselves. This would remove most off-ramps and Russia would force themselves into an all or nothing attack.

The other realistic option for Russia to undertake to pressure Ukraine further is to mobilize more troops, as they've already deployed effectively all staged troops. Ignoring the level of training and morale of these troops, paper numbers, etc. even in the best case for Russia throwing more troops at Ukraine is very likely to both exacerbate existing logistical, supply and co-ordination issues, and lead to further domestic (although compared to the other option much less international) backlash. This would still keep the door open for negotiations. 

So Russia is moving slowly closer to achieving slated short term objectives, but at the same time their overall goals seem further and further away, and the options for escalation have significant risks

Ukraine's goals are much less grand but similarly difficult: get Russians out with minimal losses of people or sovereignty. Despite all Russian failings, it seems very very unlikely Ukraine through military alone would be able to push Russian troops back to Russia. Hence a negotiation where they are forced into neutrality but retain territorial sovereignty, self-governance, means to protect themselves/military, etc. could be worth it-- fundamentally the war is in Ukraine, decimating their economy which is fueled through foreign support, and Ukrainian civilians, infrastructure, etc. is being destroyed

Of course, things can change and it's possible no negotiation is reached, but it does seem likely as stalemates and strategic pauses in advance open the door for talks-- even if getting something sorted will be up to Ukrainian leaders and Putin being able to acknowledge the realities of the situation they're both in",fea364bb24880980637cf4b1d7d3b04910c49cab,True,False,,,,,0,1647000772,,0,{},i08cgpn,False,t3_tb199v,False,True,t3_tb199v,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tb199v/ukraine_megathread_march_10/i08cgpn/,1647000789,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646971972.0

* We've never attempted such deep sanctions on a country so connected to the global economy, especially in Europe. This will be one of the first instances where significant economic blowback will happen to those imposing the sanctions.
* Sanctions to stop a conflict are often overwhelmingly focused on stopping the materials needed to prosecute a war being sent into a country.

At least some of the radios had been manufactured in China before elements were added in Russia, the defendants claimed. Russian forums discussing the radios also feature complaints of ‘childhood illnesses’ and short battery lives for the Azart family, as well as further evidence of Chinese parts in the radios. It is not unusual for radio families to experience difficulties when introduced into service; 

The term ""childhood illnesses"" is a uniquely Russian term for what we in the West typically refer to as the ""early adopter"" tax. I.E. the kind of issues you discover when creating a new product or technology and using it for the first time.

Think of common recall problems in cars, for instance. For particularly persistent issues, a good analogy would be OLED burn in, a problem still not fully solved.

Either way, an operation this large has never been attempted before by Russia, it's not surprising to see a wide range of issues. Unlike Syria and Donbass, which were smaller, and much more controlled engagements.

We fuct up a bunch of Iraqi roads, which generally weren't all that good to begin with, by driving tracked shit on it.  The Stryker was supposed to be sort of the answer; wheels, lighter than a Bradley, more armored than a basic Humvee.  The Stryker didn't look very good for a while and by now the US has upgraded pretty much all of them to different suspension and engine, armor changes, etc.  The V-hull was supposed to help the IED threat but makes the vehicle difficult to use on long missions.  Interestingly, future plans are to replace the remote machine gun turret on half the Strykers with a Javelin launcher(!).

So thinking inside the Pentagon has been along similar lines for years, although mainly over deployment speed issues initially (from my understanding).  The Stryker probably needs more armor to keep things like a SDhK or RPG-7 from penetrating the hull.  No it will never handle a ATGM let alone a contemporary ATGM.  But it would be more mobile and less-infrastructure-destroying, and you can make a lot more of them.

Keep in mind, we're discussing occupation and slaughter of Ukraine. If the west is unwilling to hold a line against that, then we have a Russia who can, with impunity, pick off the remaining independent nations one by one.  
\&gt;&gt;

What you say amounts to an accusation that if someone who buys a gun to defend themselves then refuses to do so if a bad guy is swinging an AR-15 around a crowded school yard, they are ALSO not going to draw and shoot when similarly threatened in their living room.

X /=/ Y.

There are rules and there is brotherhood.  We stand by fellow NATO members because that's what we promised to do.  You saying otherwise makes yourself sound like you -want us- to be weak if we don't prove our manhood by going off, charging into Ukraine atop a pale horse.  Ridden by killer accountants.

That's not how it works.

We don't stand beside Ukraine because Ukraine was too weak to hold the line, if we didn't go in.  And if we did, that means our forces are the ones taking nukes to the teeth in the Russian near abroad.  For an unaligned state.

THAT kind of foolishness could indeed weaken us to the point we could be taken.  Conventionally.

But on our own soil, with both nuclear and conventional parity?

No.

The only thing which would prevent a NATO win in Eastern Europe is our choosing not to fight.  And despite what you say, we \_would fight\_ for our own.  America has never failed to honor our commitments to NATO.  Maybe it's time for NATO (Europe) to stop failing to honor it's own promises to pay for an adequate warfighter.

Russia does not have the ability to project power more than 1,000km beyond her land borders, into a contested theater.  We do.  So she cannot do this in Central Africa or SWA or anyplace else.  Because we will stomp those Wagner or other PMC forces, like ants with a steam roller.

We've done it before.

If Russia so much as twitches in Europe's direction, she's done.

Because she is a single-COG city state centered on a dictator, with \_one\_ megalopolis of 11.92 million.  While Europe and the U.S., together, boast 14+18 cities of 1 million plus and could survive the ultimate attack \_if it was survivable\_.

Moscow done is Russia over.

WDC, Berlin, Paris, London gone is a horrific tragedy but it is not the end for our civilization.  Not even close.  And here is the key thing:  Moscow is part of the combat theater for any attack she makes into the Baltics or Poland/Romania.  She cannot avoid a theater nuclear counterstrike.

And that is where NATO's responsibilities begin and end.  We protect member states, even if it means a direct attack, on Moscow.

Ukraine whored her battle wares ('Lord Of War') to the highest bidder in the 1990s.  In doing so, she abdicated the most fundamental of national rules: Thou Shalt Protect Yourselves.

But this FACT doesn't change the reality that NATO won the Cold War.

Europe is emptied of the Barbarian Horde from the East.  They cannot come back unless they wish to commit national suicide.

Stop pretending that this is a loss.  This is ONE MAN admitting we won and he is terrified of Russia no longer being a looming presence in the East.

It is also Europe getting excited about war because the Europeans will slit each other's throats with whoever will sell them the biggest knife.  It's in their genetics.  Yet there is no threat here.  None at all.

We.  Have.  Won.

When Putin dies, as most 70 year old men do, the cult of personality around him will collapse.  That is 10-15 years, tops.

And \_if there is a macro economic sphere left\_, the Russians will be all too happy to rejoin it.

By letting Ukraine go.

And we should encourage that precondition, by saying, quite cheerfully:  ""Get it out of your system and come back to us when you are ready to be grown ups.  We miss Russia.  And choose not to think that this is you.  This is one man.""

This means we have time to rebuild our military and particularly to readopt short range ballisitic/cruise ala Pershing and Gryphon, rather than rely on manned stealth for nuclear delivery.  As a fast counter to Kalibr/Kh-101/Iskander.

This is, presently, our singular greatest weakness, as we have to go to SLBM to match the Russians for immediacy of consequences with our strategic systems.  Which means thermonuclear yields far higher than necessary.

We do not embitter the Russian peoples by punishing them with heavy sanctions but we DO TAKE a more measured approach to getting away from Russian Petrogas and putting the Europeans in particular, back on nuclear power.

It means we DO NOT jeopardize the USD as GRC, which is what underlines our economic and military power, by playing monkey wrench in the gears and cogs of macro economics as global trade.

It means we DO develop U.S. oil production, in the GOM and the Dakotas and Alaska.  Using European engineering expertise to speed the process along, in trade for promises on quick LNG production, next winter.

It again means WE DO NOT jeopardize global trade by playing about with the newest tool of warfare.  Because defense is not warfare.  It is the prevention of warfare.  And attempting to max out ECW by penalizing billions over the loss of a city state with 44 million people in it, is \_dumb\_.

CONCLUSION:  
Back off, take a breath.  And promise yourself you will not start a spiral of fiscal and economic decline that makes genuine warfare easier, from desperation.

Because you have kids who will see the 21st century dawn, if you're careful with doing only what is needed to protect them and their kids.  And nothing more.

Let me ask this: Can Ukraine win a settlement where they keep their military with zero constitutional limit on it, and continue to build and expand their military, agree not to join NATO, and Putin keeps Crimea and those two regions he wants in eastern Ukraine?

I hate to say it but that would be a pretty good outcome and seems to be the only realistic short term way to finish the war.  Putin will not stop without some sort of victory

I highly doubt Zelensky would ever agree to demilitarize 

I don’t think it would be possible for Zelensky to get Russia to agree to relinquish Crimea and those two eastern regions, I mean the only way that would happen is if Ukraine outright launched a massive counter offensive and actually drove Russia back to their border but that just seems all around extremely unlikely.  Putin would bring the absolute full brunt of the Russian military down and I doubt Ukraine can beat that while in the offense, whereas in the defense they have a good shot

Seems to me that the only short term resolution to the war is the one I stated above

Am I wrong here? Is there anyway Ukraine can get Crimea back?

If Ukraine secured Crimea, their eastern borders and Russia got absolutely nothing out of this that really could be it for Putin

&gt;Is pretty much everyone in the Kremlin on the same page as Putin? Are they pretty much all on the nationalist page of. “Russia must expand its borders, and reclaim its status as a global and military superpower on par with United States”)

Hard to say. The Kremlin is, as always, very difficult to penetrate. I think it's safe to say that most in the Moscow political elite want a satisfying resolution to the question of Ukraine (and how could they not? No power in the world can long tolerate a hostile power on its borders). The nature of that resolution appears to be very much up for debate (and indeed, Putin favoured the diplomatic approach from 2014 - 2020 but Zelensky took the hardline here). Short answer is they agree with pacifying Ukraine / bringing it into the Russian sphere, but likely disagree with the war. 

&gt;Does Putin face any real political opposition? Would capitulating make him vulnerable? Some have suggested it would be political suicide but I have no way to judge how true that could be

Even the most ruthless of authoritarian regimes face *some* political opposition. I am sure there's elements of Russian elite society that would love to see Putin gone, but whether or not they have the power is another question. I think what's safe to say is that a bad conclusion to the war (a humiliating defeat / armistice) would put Putin's regime in its weakest position ever. Whether or not someone can take advantage of that remains to be seen. 

&gt;Do you disagree with me on what I said about if Russia looses? If so why?

To be honest I can see it breaking either way (I know that's an unsatisfying answer, but allow me to explain). War and politics are highly contingent, and the survival of a regime is hardly ever predicated on one specific outcome (rulers, in general, don't like to take risks with colossal downside and minimal chance of upside). If Putin loses the war, I think he faces a host of internal problems. It's not just sanctions. It's POWs coming home, it's wounded soldiers, its elites now confined to Russia with mere millions instead of billions (oh the humanity), it's a hostile burned out warzone on their doorstep that will surely export problems in their direction, among many other things. 

Russia's major pillars of power are Land, Hydrocarbons, and Military strength. Destroying one of those (Military) and weakening global energy dependence on Russia opens a veritable pandoras box for Putin's regime. Make no mistake, where we are today is probably the Kremlin's worst case scenario in their predictions.

Relevant passage from article supplies some details:

BeginQuote

Hopefully the effect is becoming obvious - by impacting the statistical armour and detonating at that point, the armour has given the RPG a free c.300+ mm of free standoff extension, pushing from its inherent 2 CD standoff to something more 6 to 8 CD, and in turn _upping penetration by a full CD or more. The armour just amplified the threat capability by a good 20%, making life worse for you inside that vehicle_. The actual effect is heavily reliant on the specific CD standoff/penetration curve for the particular warhead design in question, but as a representative example it is indicative of the issue at hand.

These figures were hypothetical, the PG-7 does not conform to this specific chart, but the principle endures - _RPG projectiles rarely have ideal built-in standoff in order to avoid large and unwieldy rounds that would be onerous to transport and handle, and so detonation on statistical armour is in essentially all cases a modest enhancement to their capability as a threat to you inside the vehicle_.


In the _rare cases where it is a degradation_, for example with very large and unwieldy projectiles like the PG-7VR tandem warhead round, note that the penetration chart declines much more gradually than it rises - you need to get the round beyond 14 CD or more before there is a tangible degradation in penetration, and _that reflects nearly a metre of standoff, which when doubled to reflect this armour being on both sides of a vehicle would have woeful implications to operating such a vehicle in anything but open country._


_There is no reason a designer would seek to extend the standoff in this manner, and so it is a myth that this is the intent of the armour concept._

A lot of the people saying Ukraine is winning the war are talking about the first one, while for people in Ukraine, I imagine they would much rather have the second one. Sure, given the funding, people, and equipment at their disposal they can make the Russian advance a very, very expensive proposition. One which would cost Russian far, far more than they will ever be able to recoup. That sort of conflict is not one Russia is likely to win without wiping out all of Ukraine. However, while that's technically ""winning,"" it basically involves Ukraine giving up basically everything to fight a long-term conflict without a clear goal.

Obviously this isn't a very desirable outcome. For the Ukrainian people a better outcome would be the cessation of hostilities, and a return so at least some form of status quo. Whether this be in the form of a peace accord, or in the form of Russia backing down in the face of WW3; as long as the bomb stop falling on civilian areas, such a result would be much better for the people of both countries.

its always difficult to counter attack in an environment where the other side owns the air. 

2. coming out of hidden bunkers and going out into the open is very risky. Its not clear at all to me that they need to do this to win this war. In the present situation it does not seem that Russia has nearly enough men to encircle any of the truly large cities ie. Kiev, Kharkov. It also seems that even Russia recognizes this and seems to be reduced to terror bombing in order to get some sort of peace agreement that allows them to keep donbas/donetsk/crimea.  So this seems like an incredible risk that could very well jeopardize the advantage that they may hold. 

3. Im also not convinced time is on the side of Russia. Sure RUS can regroup and send more men, but again they would  need huge forces to besiege major cities and that doenst seem a viable option.
