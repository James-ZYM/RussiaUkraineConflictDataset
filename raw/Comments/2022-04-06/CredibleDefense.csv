In shallower waters SSKs are great, they can be stealthier and that helps for intelligence gathering or for laying in ambush for surface ships.

SSNs are much better ASW assets though. SSKs, even with much-hyped AIP technology, have operational limitations. SSNs have much better endurance and speed, which allows them to hunt other submarines more effectively. 

Ports and fixed infrastructure can be protected by UUVs. Fleets can be protected by surface AWS. Airbourne ASW is helpful but planes can't be in the air all the time.

South Korean SSNs will obviously be a strategic asset, they won't be trying to chase down every little Sang-O submarine.

Sang-O's will be trying to infiltrate ports, UUVs can help. Sang-O's will try to threaten ROKN surface ships, there a Frigates and ASW helos for that.

[],False,,BeondTheGrave,,,[],,,,text,t2_4zro2,False,False,"&gt;Is it possible to use ATGM’s, SAMs, etc. in an offensive capacity?

Yes. There are some obvious challenges to using ATGMs, but overall they can be used in offensive combat like an RPG system, or a M/HMG, or any other heavy weapon.

Shoulder fired missiles and Javelin type missiles require no setup and can be fired anywhere. Say your squad comes into contact with an enemy tank during a movement to contact. Well your Javelin guy finds a good spot, plops down, and shoots his missile. Then once things are clear, the squad can resume forward movement. Shoulder launched missiles like the NLAW, or even ex-Soviet/Russian weapons like the RPG, can also equally be used by troops on the advance, though this requires more delicate movement. AFAIK the NLAW really prefers side shots to frontal, so you just have to maneuver against the flank of a hostile tank position. Either way, clearing a tank is a lot like clearing infantry. You make contact with the enemy, assess the situation, develop an understanding of the battlefield and enemy dispositions, develop a plan to overcome it, then attack and win. Whether you've got ATGMs or AKs the concept remains the same. 

Fixed ATGMs like the Corsair, TOW (as an example, has Ukraine gotten many TOWs?) or ex-Soviet weapons like the AT-8 need to set up to be used. This requires setting up the launcher and control unit, preferably in a good high concealment position. At first that may seem way less flexible, and its true it is! But also armies have been using MGs in exactly this way since 1914. One way to overcome an enemy position is to build a base of fire which can then provide over watch for advancing troops. Drop an AT-8 at the end of a road or a long line of fire and let him wait. If the enemy calls in armored support to check the advance of dismounts, say through a neighboring forest or along a row of buildings, you pop it with the emplaced ATGM. This enables the infantry to continue their forward movement. When they hit the limits of cover, the ATGM pulls up stakes and follows quickly behind so they can all do it again. Also never underestimate the utility of offensively defensive positions. You want to clear a town? One key factor would be isolating enemy access to said town. You can do that by siting ambush positions, blocking positions, or a check point along the likely MSR. Then when enemy reinforcements pull up, they have to engage your blocking force *before* even trying to stop your clearing operation. Even if a light blocking detachment is overcome it may inflict so many casualties that the enemy is still unable to salvage the situation. Conversely and ideally a blocking detachment does its job and stops the enemy counter movement before it can influence the main action.

Operationally its easy to draw firm distinctions between 'offensive' and 'defensive' warfare. But tactically all combat is simultaneously both offensive and defensive. Fire enables movement, movement enables fire. Your movement and fire denies the enemy's own movement and fire, and gives you command of the situation.",edb38ce3f42fa4ee6fb8dc3ae4abbd7a35efaf7a,True,False,,,,,0,1649288177,,0,{},i3p1kz5,False,t3_txlmm4,False,True,t1_i3mcy67,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/txlmm4/ukraine_megathread_april_6/i3p1kz5/,1649288188,2,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649259377.0

The Russian's can then go on the defensive and wait for the Ukrainian army in the JFO to wither away from lack of supplies. 

Alternatively after takeing Lozova the Russians could then push south on Pavlohad. This would be a huge strategic loss to Ukraine and would completely unhinge the JFO.

There are people here that will say that the Russian army is in a poor state so won't be able to do this. This is true however I doubt the Ukrainian professional army is in all that good of shape either. Russia has been hammering Ukaine in the deep since day 1. So they to will also be scrambling.

There have been E-3 flying over Poland in figure-of-eight pattern (callsign NATO01 and similar). Not always, but I've seen them every couple of days. They are likely there more often, just not always with transponders on.

&gt; And most relevantly, Tankers, with LAGR callsigns. Sometimes 1, usually 2. One over Poland, 1 over Romania.

There are more of them. In addition to US KC35R with LAGR callsigns, there are also US KC10 with NHCO callsigns, Dutch A330-243MRTT with MMF callsigns and also British A330 (don't remember callsign). 

&gt; What are they refuelling?

Fighters mostly, there are quite a lot of them it seems. They normally fly without transponders on, but occasionaly they switch them on. During the war, I have seen:

- British Typhoons over Poland (all the way from England)
- US F-16 over Poland (from either England or Geramny)
- US F-16 over Romania (from Northern Italy)
- British Typhoons over Romania (from Cyprus) (see [official British video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um6qr7HpoRE))
- There is also Harry S. Truman stationed somewhere among Greek islands, I imagine also flying sorties.

&gt; I think whatever they are refuelling have their transponders off

Yes

&gt; which implies they are flying over Ukrainian territory.

Very very unlikely. That would be huge escalation.

&gt; If they were skirting the border like the Rivet Joints are they would have the transponder on

Why do you think so? Tankers have their transponders almost always on, but other aircraft switch transponders on and off quite often. There is no reason to assume they would have transponder on all the time.

&gt; reporting Russian aircraft to Ukrainian air defence

Yes, both E-3, RC-135, and RQ4 are most likely relaying some information to Ukraine, but they don't need to enter Ukraine airspace for that. They can do their job from Polish and Romanian airspace just fine. 

&gt; But if this were the case, why would Russia keep quiet about it?

In the beginning  Russia have protested at least once against NATO supplying intelligence information to Ukraine, but they cannot do much about it.

&gt; are the tankers just for refuelling fighters on standby patrol?

They may also be refuelling other intelligence aircraft and bombers (I have seen B-52 flying around Europe from time to time lately). But mostly fighters.

The river is at least 500 meters wide at that point, the Ukrainians have little hope of any meaningful crossing, aside from harassment attacks. certainly something 9 BTG's can handle.

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"I beg to differ. The mud season made a massive difference especially after the first couple days and weeks when the Russians started trying to tactically and operationally readjust after recognizing the Ukrainians were resisting, but still stuck trying to move toward the strategic objectives that were given away in the first week. 

At that point the Ukrainians could plant even small units to delay or outright halt Russian advances, especially in urbanized areas on the outskirts of major cities, because the Russians were forced to advance in column formation through channelized kill zones without any real ability to use any sort of maneuver.  In a situation like that, strength amounts to nothing, throwing a full tank brigade on the attack against only a platoon on the defense still comes down to a platoon vs platoon engagement. Less even, because a platoon on defense can actually set up on line while the advancing platoon might be stuck in a file formation, and at best can move two AFV abreast. 

And what happens when the attacker takes losses? They block the road and become obstacles that need to be moved off, all while artillery reigns down on those behind them stuck in a traffic jam. 

I will list off some historical examples of this, to get an understanding of what channelized terrain can do to an attack. 

\- Thermopylae: A small number of Greeks (about 4,000 in total) held off a massive force of Persians (anywhere from 50,000 to millions) for three days because of a narrow front that allowed a small number of defenders to match a small frontage of attackers. They were only defeated when an alternate route around the nearby mountain was found and exploited, encircling the Greek position. 

\- The Battle of the Hedgerows 1944: While the US Army knew there were hedgerows in Normandy they thought they were like the small like the British ones they trained with and instead were [like this](https://www.dday-overlord.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/bocage_moderne-1.jpg). That acted similar to mud, forcing the US Army's tanks to travel directly down the roads or to look for exits within the nearby fields, both of which were covered heavily by German anti-tank weapons. Infantry could advance through the fields but without tank support they were taking extremely heavy losses, and couldn't move too far away from the roads as those were needed to move their supplies. It wasn't until various hedgerow cutting implements and techniques were standardized that tanks [could advance off the roads](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/72/4e/16/724e16dc2fa4c8adc44ec315467787f3.jpg) at which point the breakout of St Lo occurred, which would be akin to the mud in Ukraine drying.  

\- The West Wall campaign 1944: The US Army against suffered major difficulties trying to break through the German fixed defenses in the Low Countries and German-French border in the fall of 1944, namely because the fighting was occuring in one of wettest autumns in decades, forcing them to be roadbound because of mud.

2. Russians are capable of learning. The difference between operations a month ago and operations now is that units had the opportunity to learn from past mistakes. In other words, instead of charging ahead without securing logistics in fast moving road bound convoys that ran into ambushes and left significant Ukrainian forces in their rear, it's possible that the Russians are taking another approach?

1. Putin thinks he knows better than anyone else so only wants people who agree with him, fatal mistake of all dictatorships. So if any of the assumptions I outline below are incorrect, nobody would tell him otherwise. 
2. Bribes paid were supposed to make this a coup with the troops rushing in to secure things, war is over in days before NATO has its pants on. 
3. Bribes didn't work, military knows the coup isn't happening and Putin has made clear Plan B is the hot invasion because Ukraine is a rotten shed that will collapse once someone kicks in the door. (Hitler said that about Russia lol) 
4. Generals know that he's not realizing this is not the Ukraine of 2014 and that their armed forces are not really equipped for a big fight (or they may even be as unaware of their inability to fight as he is) 
5. Generals leak the plan to the west to spook Putin into not fighting. He ignores the leaks and doubles down. 
6. Putin is still firmly assured Ukraine is weak, his military can handle the fight, anyone saying otherwise is a coward who doesn't have the stomach for a real fight. 
7. When things go south, he triples and quadruples down because small little man is not weak, he shows strength like with many shirtless photos. (I can't think of any other dictator whose nipples I've seen. I've never seen a beach picture of Hitler of Mussolini.) 
8. Because the West has been pretty toothless about all his other provocations, why would they be any different with this one? And what does it matter if they feed intel to the Ukranians if they'll simply collapse like the puppet government in Afghanistan with all their western supplies? 
9. Zelinsky is somehow a jewish neo-nazi coward and will flee when the attack happens and our puppets can be easily installed. 

What it honestly feels like is one of those historic doomed expeditions. You read the account of what they wanted to do and the preparation for it and even a layman can see a disconnect and surely someone must have told the leaders failing to plan is planning for failure and they said nonsense and powered through and the expedition is launched and then fails. 

Or, for a visual metaphor -- this is the man who tried to demonstrate an unworkable parachute by jumping from the Eiffel Tower. 

""Hervieu, who was present to witness the demonstration, also attempted to dissuade him from making the jump. He was concerned that the parachute needed longer to fully open than the few seconds the drop from the first platform would allow, and he also presented other technical objections to which Reichelt could not provide a satisfactory response.[15] Reichelt finally replied that:

You are going to see how my seventy-two kilos and my parachute will give your arguments the most decisive of denials.""

It ended as one would expect.

&gt; We must recognise and go beyond our usual well-worn paths. Euro-Atlantic discourse on Russia has a long tradition of wishful thinking, of ignoring the ‘grey rhinos’ (a high-probability, high-impact development that took shape over a long period but was largely ignored) of Moscow’s strategic agenda, and instead mainstreaming ‘black swan’ scenarios (low-probability, high-impact events) such as Moscow shifting its policies to implement reform and seek reconciliation with the West. From the first days of this crisis, much of the discussion has simply echoed that of previous crises, with commentators sketching out possible scenarios of Moscow’s defeat and subsequent international isolation, and Putin’s fall. Perhaps such events may come to pass. But this is not foresight, nor a basis for strategy.

&gt; Foresight exists, therefore, to inform our decision-makers as agents of this process, and whose decisions will shape the future of this crisis. Its purpose is to identify what is under our control, and what we can, and what we cannot, do. It is a process of agency, tied to action.

Obviously it'll only show aircraft with their transponder on, but it's still interesting to watch. Today is the first time I've first time I've seen an E-3 Sentry, flying figure-8s around Romania, and it occured to me, why haven't I seen any AWACS before?

Usually there's a few different aircraft flying around Ukraine border. First, American Blackhawk helicopters, usually DUKE callsigns, flying back and forth between 2 Polish airfields that look entirely civilian on Google Maps. Usually a RC-135 Rivet Joint going up and down the Polish-Ukrainian border. Sometimes a Global Hawk over the Black Sea. And most relevantly, Tankers, with LAGR callsigns. Sometimes 1, usually 2. One over Poland, 1 over Romania.

What are they refuelling? They can't refuel Global Hawks, are too fast for Blackhawks, and there's only ever 1 Rivet Joint at a time, you wouldn't need so many tankers for that. I think whatever they are refuelling have their transponders off, which implies they are flying over Ukrainian territory. (If they were skirting the border like the Rivet Joints are they would have the transponder on). My suspicion is it's the AWACS birds, reporting Russian aircraft to Ukrainian air defence, which would explain why we haven't seen them on Flightradar before.

This might explain why the Russian Air Force has been doing relatively poorly, they are facing a uniquely bad situation. Ukrainian SAM systems can keep their radars off until the moment of firing, relying on the AWACS to tell them when a Russian fighter is in range. This would make SEAD very difficult for the Russians, which rely on enemy air defence using their radar to indicate their position. In a normal war they would just shoot down the AWACS , the MiG-31 has a long range missile for basically this purpose, but they risk bringing NATO into the war if they do.

But if this were the case, why would Russia keep quiet about it? They would have to know, every plane with a Radar Warning Receiver within a thousand miles could tell when an AWACS turns it's radar on. If they publicly accuse NATO of doing it could they force them to stop?

What do you think? are the tankers just for refuelling fighters on standby patrol? Do they normally have transponders off?

We've seen footage in the Iraq War and elsewhere of what an ammo dump getting hit looks like, its basically a small nuke. Do that a lot.

\- Patrol, patrol, patrol. Own the ""no man's land"" between the lines and deny the Russians the ability to gain ground intel. Send out snipers, AT hunter killer teams to constantly attrit the forward units.

The intelligence issue allows Ukraine to pick and choose targets that lets them punch way above their weight.

The corruption issue will continue to hobble Russia's attempts to consolidate and reform their forces. It will keep undercutting morale. And it will keep throwing wrenches in Russia's plans.

B/c of that I assume Russia will try one or two more big actions that won't work for all the reasons their previous actions won't work and they'll consolidate in the Donbass and just outside of Crimea and go into a stalemate.

The two big factors that I'm curious about are no longer trying to move stuff through Belarus and what Russia does with their KIA. The Belarussians unwillingness to work with Russia to move equipment was probably a bigger factor than it's made out to be. Even if they don't block everything, being worried about sabotage hobbles your ability to move. Having all the supply lines within Russia will be a big help. It's going to be an open question as to how big of a help it will be though. B/c the Russians did a lot better in the east than in the north, but they still didn't do that great.

The other thing is, Russia has been able to slow roll bringing war dead home. This is b/c the experience in Afghanistan showed that it's really hard, and might be even harder with more modern communications, to counter the influence of grieving mothers. They had a lot of moral force in ending the Afghanistan war. And if casualty counts are anywhere near correct the death toll from this conflict is about 100X Afghanistan, 400 per day vs 4 per day. Either Russia starts returning bodies and you get telegram channels flooded with funerals, or you don't and you get increasingly angry mothers.

For the /r/savedyouaclick crowd

In 2014, Ukraine’s military was “an army literally in ruins”, according to its former Armed Forces chief.

It’s army was riddled with corruption and lacked basic logistics, from modern weapons to a medical system. Russians tanks had just rolled into the Crimea and seized a strategic piece of Ukraine’s Black Sea coast.

Eight years later and a month into a full-scale Russian invasion, the Ukrainian military have defied the odds by out-performing the larger and better equipped Russian military on the battlefield.

So, how could that be?

“ They've really turned it around. It’s pretty impressive,” said Col Liam Collins, who was the U.S. military’s Senior Defense Advisor to Ukraine from 2016-2018. “Ukraine had one of the largest militaries in the world in 2014, but they were terrible. They didn't train, they were horrendous,” he told Univision.

Collins, and other military experts, attribute the astonishing turn around to a “herculean effort” in barely six years by Ukrainian military leaders, coupled with millions of dollars of training and military equipment from an international group of countries, led by the United States, along with the U.K., Canada, Germany and Lithuania.

In 2014, Ukraine’s defense minister said the country had 6,000 combat-ready troops. Today, Ukraine’s army numbers around 170,000 active duty troops, as well as 100,000 reservists and volunteer Territorial Defense Forces.

“Boy they were motivated to defend their country and they were taking the steps to develop,” said retired Major General Tim McGuire, who was deputy commander of U.S. Forces in Europe from 2016-2018.

However, the odds remain daunting as Russia's army is twice the size of Ukraine's and its total armed forces of 900,000 are more than four times greater.

“It's horrific to see the destruction, the loss of life that's occurring, but on the other hand you can't help but be inspired by and be very proud of the Ukrainian response. And that's one I don't think Putin put in his calculus,” said McGuire who visited the training in Ukraine and hosted Ukrainian units training in Germany.

With wars still raging in Syria and Afghanistan, and the U.S. caught up in a contentious election, the effort to reform Ukraine’s military went largely unnoticed and unreported at the time.

Critics say more could have been done, and sooner. The assistance was conducted in fits and starts, and had to overcome political obstacles, including President Donald Trump withholding of military aid in 2019 as part of a so-called ‘quid pro quo’ to obtain political favors from President Volodymir Zelensky.

Ukraine launches drastic reform of armed forces
To be sure, Russian military incompetence and poor logistics has helped, but that shouldn't take anything away from the Ukrainian military performance on the battlefield, experts say.

At the very start, Ukraine’s leaders agreed to a top-to-bottom overhaul of the country’s old-fashioned and inefficient, Soviet-era military doctrine, and the creation of a professional military with proper training and logistics.

“ It wasn’t just the assistance, the training and the equipment, there was also a commitment to reform by the Ukrainians,” said Collins, who spent two years working in Ukraine and came away deeply impressed, so much so that he’s not surprised by the results.

Unlike the U.S. experience in Afghanistan and Iraq, the trainers discovered the Ukrainians were genuinely committed to defending their nation, Collins soon discovered. And they took seriously the threat of a larger attack, from Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Heavy Tanks stuck around for a bit, but went the way of the dodo in the 60's because they couldnt do anything an MBT couldn't. Light tanks have generally been a more niche but semi-constant role.

[I called that nearly a month ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/TankPorn/comments/tav3un/comment/i04uwzs/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

The Soviet Union/Russia has followed this same not quite military invasion plan multiple times in recent history. Attempts at regime change or crushing rebellions/revolutions in Hungary '56, Czechoslovakia '68, Chechnya '94, Georgia '08, Crimea '14, and now Ukraine '22. 

All followed the nearly identical template. Border countries to USSR/Russia. Multiple axes of advance from different cardinal directions. Focus on rapid armored spearheads advancing to the capital city and other strategic locations moving as fast as possible to undermine any possible military reaction. VDV perform main effort missions usually directed at enemy capital. Everything relies on psychological factor of ""shock and awe."" And lastly, the intelligence estimates that dictate the strategy always forecast that minimal or resistance and they've only been wrong twice: Chechnya 1994 and Ukraine 2022. 

Meanwhile, then there are legitimate military invasion scenarios like the *Seven Days to the River Rhine* plan during the Cold War or the modern threat of an attempt to close the Suwalki Corridor, but those would NEVER forecast that NATO wouldn't resist. If anything, they might not resist heavily, but especially if US troops are in forward positions, Soviet/Russian military invasion plans would have to take into account their military threat and so the invasion would couch on actual military doctrine of conventional fires centric maneuver warfare, likely involving use of tactical and strategic nukes as well. 

That is what confused the fuck out of many military analysts about this war, the very credible Ukrainian military threat was present before the invasion, they had the means, motivation, and forces to seriously resist but the Russians invaded using a strategy that didn't at all take that into consideration. And that is why Russian is losing. 

That and they invaded in the second worst time of the year in terms of weather. Nobody taking mechanized maneuver warfare seriously would ever invade a country during the beginning of its historic months long mud season. They should invade during the winter frost or during the summer, because that is when they will have the maximum tactical mobility. Otherwise, they're basically copying the hedgerow fighting in the Bocage of Normandy, road bound armored assaults on predictable routes that can be easily defended with economy of force defenses.",7cb1b4c09e05e3e09094822e06d49c37d51bc4ad,True,False,,,,,0,1649262194,,0,{},i3n6e0d,False,t3_txdxls,False,False,t1_i3mcms0,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/txdxls/why_is_russia_losing_this_war/i3n6e0d/,1649262208,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649233394.0

The UK MOD was calling out their inability or unwillingness to go overland as a major problem for the Russians. It bottled them up into choke points which made for easy pickings by Ukrainian artillery barrages and ambushes by light and irregular Ukrainians. 

The fastest advance across Ukraine was done from the north east of the country straight at Kyiv to the East of the city. It only used the roads and bypassed towns along the way. This advance also seemed to fall apart the fastest with it having collapsed before the great Russian northern withdrawal went back into Belarus. 

Many of the abandoned vehicles that were found were simply stuck in the mud. So there were absolutely attempts to go off the roads that did not work out. Before the invasion took place and war breaking out I remember seeing what looked like a Russian tank platoon stuck in mud while doing maneuvers. 

My guess is that this was known to be a factor but was brushed aside as the war was thought to be over in a few days and mechanized units would not have to fight in the field anyway.

Because during the latter's term as Minister of Defense, besides reforming the force structure (From conscriptual to a smaller but effective active ready force.

Western official: ""The the withdrawal of forces of Russian forces from northern Ukraine, around Kyiv and around Chernihiv, is...largely complete. There are isolated pockets of Russian forces which will try to make their way back, but are under pressure""

Western official: ""We have not yet seen sort of the mass redeployment of those Russian forces [from around Kyiv]. We've seen the early stages of some of the VDV airborne forces starting to make their way to join the forces in around the Donbas"". Others need to be replenished.

Western official: 29 Russian BTGs ""rendered non-combat effective, so they've had to be either taken out of the line in order to be refurbished and reconstituted, or they've had to be amalgamated with other battalion tactical groups to generate a single group out of...three.""

Western official: ""obviously, as they've shortened their lines of communication [and] they focus on the area of operations [in Donbas], it gives them the opportunity to concentrate force more effectively—but bringing more forces to bear is still a problem for them.""

Western official: ""We believe the 9th May [Victory Day] is a significant date [for Russia] given the usual parade [in Moscow]...when you have a political imperative, which drives things in a particular way, you can end up with military disaster as a consequence.""

Western official, in response to my question on whether Russian force employment is improving: ""even as late as yesterday, we're still seeing single files of Russian armour attempting to advance down roads, and then coming into problems when it's met by by Ukrainian resistance.""

Western official: ""the threat pace to Kyiv is limited for the foreseeable future.

Their Su-57 first flight was 2010 and yet they've only been able to make 15 of them... for comparison the F-35II first flight was 2006 and we have more than 750 delivered and currently around 140 being built per year.

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"My opinion is that maneuver war lasts until early to summer and then everything because positional, trench warfare style and diplomatic talks end the war. 

In Eastern Ukraine the Russians are in a pretty good position since the border area already places UAF forces in a salient that is vulnerable from multiple sides, and Russian advances already made that a smaller salient. Without losing all of Eastern Ukraine voluntarily, the Ukrainians can't voluntarily pull out, nor can they remove the threat without retaking all of Crimea first in a massive counteroffensive they probably can't perform. 

If they're smart  the Russians take a bit of a strategic pause for about a month to reconstitute units with manpower and equipment replacements, mass supplies at forward operating bases, give their troops a break, do maintenance, some time to train on newly created TTPs like ""ATGM drills,"" conduct recon of the UAF defensive positions in front of them, etc. All those are desperately needed at this point and it'll give them time to come up with a new plan to coincide with the end of the mud season, which reignites mechanized  tactical mobility and gives them a major edge they've largely lacked so far.

Russian doctrine focuses on set piece battles, not improvising on the fly. With the weather favoring them, with rebuilt units, incorporating some lessons learned, stockpiles of supplies moved to forward operating bases, they can launch a massed front loaded offensive unlike the previous. 

That mean old school fires formulas where they are massing large amounts of arty, rockets, ballistic missiles, air strikes on the smallest defensive frontage possible, with armored spearheads in line formation right behind a rolling barrage to the point that when arty shifts and lifts the tanks and IFV are basically right on the UAF defensive lines, with the overall point to drive north and south to link up, cut UAF east west supply lines, and encircle the UAF forces in eastern Ukraine.

They have no real ability to do that now because they're still road bound due to weather (which are easy to defend) and most combat units are hurt bad from manpower and equipment losses and are barely combat effective. They've been fighting non-stop for six weeks now, which is a pretty good amount of time especially in shitty weather and a shittier situation and they need a break. But if they get that, and they're not road bound, the tactical situation changes immensely. No longer can a few guys with man portable AT weapons or a few AFV hold up an entire company or battalion armored column, as they'll be able to spread out into the countryside and bypass the roads, which only trucks and certain other wheeled vehicles will need to travel on.Once that happens, the Russians are going to start gobbling up terrain. The UAF will need to toss lots of bodies to stop that, and even with good weapons they're going to suffer heavy losses.

That's my take. And I think that's what the Russians are planning. They evacuated the Kyiv front for a reason, to use the troops elsewhere. They went public and said they're going to focus on Eastern Ukraine. I don't know where they can get the replacements at this point because they said they won't use conscripts to replace them but there are ways around that.",4690641f08a3ad565a2080a0c22acd8bd766ec4d,True,False,,,,,0,1649255564,,0,{},i3mp9im,False,t3_txlmm4,False,True,t1_i3mdwqf,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/txlmm4/ukraine_megathread_april_6/i3mp9im/,1649255579,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649226764.0

If but the world were so simple.

Without Russian gas countries like Finland would run out of energy in just 2 weeks. There would be a collapse in economic output due to lack of power to actually keep European economies going potentially leading to mass unemployment. You would have severe levels of poverty throughout Europe as inflation skyrocketed. This would also filter through into the international financial sector, with rising interests rates potentially causing another eurozone crisis. 

In a worst case scenario it would lead to a global economic crisis causing mass suffering in itself. 

Now a lot of the issues are possible to mitigate against, but right now there's an unseasonably cold spell in Europe so we can't even count on the reduced usage because 'winter is over'. I'd assume countries are looking to change their energy supply chains as we speak.

However.... There is quite literally a finite supply of gas around the world. If we don't buy it then someone else will, and the only result is that prices are higher for everyone else... But a discount for whomever purchases Russian gas. Maybe this hurts russia's economy somewhat. 

The only meaningful reason to actually stop buying Russian gas is to remove the 'power' it gives Russia over us by wielding the threat to cut off supplies.

Russia is manpower poor, it has a very small reserve of combat capable manpower remaining it can call on without declaring this a war and opening its access to its reserves. Ukraine is at full mobilisation and is likely generating new forces from lower readiness reserves but started with far less hardware and the hardware they had was older and less capable. 

The attrition rate up to a few days ago meant both sides could not sustain the war at that pace. 

But this is war and wars are fought between intelligent, resourceful people which means adaption is a constant. Both sides are adapting and trying new strategies and ways to find and exploit the others weaknesses. That is to say Russia may trigger a mobilisation and take the political risk to the regime. Ukraine is beginning to receive replacement hardware that it can quickly integrate into its existing systems such as Czech T-72s. 

So from what we know and what we have seen, one of these two sides is likely to collapse in their combat effectiveness in the coming weeks. 

But understanding that humans are defined by the adaptability, we must expect boith to work around their weaknesses.

Mauripol is still standing and Russia will have to start trying to attack military targets for a change if they want to actually take ground.

[],False,,nuclearselly,,,[],,,,text,t2_v479g,False,False,"Decent article that outlines well some of the methods states can use to keep tabs on each other during periods of heightened tension.

Russia's words about putting nuclear forces on alert are purely for consumption through diplomatic channels. The overt message they will want to portray is that nuclear weapons are not being readied and that they are not preparing to use them.

This is because they are in an active conventional conflict involving aircraft, missiles, and the movement of large amounts of equipment internally. In a period of East-West tension (outside of war) this can appear threatening to nuclear peers (in this case, the US and NATO). You don't want those peers to misinterpret the mobilisation for a regional conflict as mobilisation for a strategic conflict. As such, Russia will be made explicit via channels the West has access to (satellites) that its strategic forces are not doing anything outside of the ordinary.

The last thing Russia wants at this point in time is to have to balance a costly conflict in Ukraine, with the difficult balancing act of moving up the strategic ladder of escalation with NATO. NATO themselves have also played ball in this regard. The alliance purposefully ignored Putin's statements regarding a nuclear alert. None of their strategic forces have changed posture, and all escalation in Eastern Europe has been of a purely conventional nature.

The worrying situation would be if this diplomatic dance/facade stopped. Able Archer 83 is the best example we have of a lack of communication almost leading to a nuclear exchange. NATO was shocked to learn subsequently that the Soviets believed a First Strike from the alliance was so likely, and that their strategic forces had been put on high alert due to misinterpretation of an exercise. This exercise happened during a period of very high tension.

While we are in a period of similar animosity between East and West now, both sides have been pretty clear about their position during this conflict, and although there have been a few remarks regarding 'regime change' pointed at Putin, it's clear both sides don't take the risk of a direct confrontation as likely currently.",e3ed4e3ddb58b0839251dd2fc1a4a06c7d2b59cd,True,False,,,,,0,1649236296,,0,{},i3lr99y,False,t3_tx3ujw,False,True,t3_tx3ujw,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tx3ujw/how_america_watches_for_a_nuclear_strike_hundreds/i3lr99y/,1649236315,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649207496.0

Recently we saw them struggle in Georgia and make some big blunders, but ultimately win due to their size. In Chechnya we saw them lose the first war, and only win the second after a long and brutal campaign. 

During the Soviet era, we saw the Red Guard lose in Finland, the Baltics, and get their arse handed to them in the Polish-Soviet War. They struggled against Finland in the Winter War, and although a ""victory"" it came at great cost. The shining light was the Great Patriotic War, but it took until 1943 for the Soviet Union to sort their shit out, and if it wasn't for the huge expanses of European Russia, favourable weather, and strategic blunders from the Nazis they might not have got that chance to regroup. Post-war it was mostly ""police actions"" and proxy conflicts with limited involvement, but when we finally saw the might of the Soviets in Afghanistan they struggled immensely and failed in their objective, although given it is ""the graveyard of Empires"", I don't think anyone particularly holds it against them. 

Going back even further, the Russian Empire was a military basket case at times. Despite huge numerical superiority they lost on the Eastern Front during WW1, and signed a separate peace with the Central Powers. Their loss was so bad that it practically brought down the state itself. The Russo-Japanese War was a humiliating defeat for a European power. And although they did have success against the Ottomans in the 19th Century, it was against the sick man of Europe, and when actually challenged by comparable forces such as Britain and France in Crimea, they got a good hiding. 

With the exception of the Great Patriotic War, Russian military prowess has not been convincing over the last century and a half or so. There has been a repeating pattern of getting into winnable conflicts against weaker adversaries, making an absolute shitshow of it, and either losing or paying far too high a price for victory. We all know Russia has vast arsenals, and masses of troops, but I think people take that at face value really.

Lighter tanks in such a conflict would be easier to transport, and they would probably do a bit better in the mountainous terrain; it'd also be easier for the Americans to land these tanks onto a beach if it comes down to that.

On the other hand (and please correct me if I'm wrong), Iran and Iraq used plenty of tanks in their own war back in the 80s, and it's hard to say how much better a 40-50ish ton vehicle would be in mountainous terrain compared to an Abrams; it's not like making a tank heavier would make it fall off a mountain.

They absolutely do.  And when you're trying to say that an edict by part of our government that is fully enforced by our government isn't law - you can see why our allies don't really buy your distinctions.

Obama was at the time the executive branch of the united states - the material benefits he offered Iran are not benefits he can provide as a person - they are benefits that he is afforded control over by our laws, that you love reading, don't worry, you made that part clear.

The president and Chief Diplomat (there are parts of the constitution I like reading, I like all his titles) of the united states made a foreign policy deal with another nation, a deal not between him as a person and that nation but the executive branch of our nation with Iran.  The executive branch has immense power (including, as you've conceded, in foreign policy), and its actions constitute the actions of our government as much as legislative actions.  How the fuck could a nation not be party to an agreement that **that nation is choosing to actively enforce?**, an agreement **fundamentally based on the abilities and policies of the nation**?

The Iran deal wasn't a treaty but it was a piece of official US foreign policy - in fact, far from the only such example that isn't a treaty.  It's how Iran percieved it, it's how Europe percieved it, it's how a lot of other nations percieved it.  So no matter how much you shriek ""no you're wrong we said we'd repeal it you should have paid attention to our partisan infighting!"" - too bad.  You look ridiculous.  We as a nation look ridiculous, and I think now that I've got you trying to say law isn't law, I've conclusively shown why.

This article is by a US tanker, makes the case for a tank that is lighter, more maneuverable, and fuel efficient, yet still able to provide the power to make a difference on the battlefield. 

This article says that the Abrams was been designed for defensive use in Europe, and thus is heavy and not very capable over terrain. Which makes sense as the Soviet tanks were designed to be light and cheap for offense into Western Europe. The difference in the traverse of the main gun makes sense there as well, the Abrams to be in hull down positions had to be able to see and shoot over prepared positions, and Soviet tanks crossing open country had to be as low as possible. 

I thought it was interesting as many Western tanks have reached extremes in terms of weight, with the new Challenger tank supposed to be somewhere over 80 tons.",5579610e166a2ba494c010f7a809b05d038be009,True,False,,,,,0,1649218475,,0,{},i3l33tp,True,t3_txdg1c,False,True,t3_txdg1c,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/txdg1c/a_balanced_team_the_need_for_options_in_armored/i3l33tp/,1649218490,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649189675.0

As far as maneuvering them, that kind of capability in ground combat vehicles just isn't viable yet. So you'd need remote drivers in the loop while moving.

Using a drone to acquire targets makes sense of course, and automation would be useful here. But also consider the most basic version of this idea without any fancy AI.

Those are your words not mine. What we do have is growth in the number and power of weapons, growth in our ability to create ever more deadly weapons, growth in the amount of people and stuff that can be destroyed. Also growth in the mistaken perception that giant wars are a thing of the past.

Yes there are efforts to prevent conflicts like creating multi country organizations like EU and NATO and yes many small conflicts are prevented / minimized.

A large gap between wars means there are more weapons saved up and more people and stuff to destroy and more people and stuff to do that destruction. So when a war that can not be prevented happens is huge. Preventing the small conflicts yields larger conflicts when they happen due to all the accumulations I listed above.

What is required is global disarmament efforts to get rid of accumulated weapons and/or many small wars to deplete stock piles (aka controlled burns) and/or efforts to create a viable backup human civilization off earth (as a fire break). 

California and Australia both have record breaking wildlife fires due to ""successful"" fire mitigation efforts that have over the years built up fuel loads and created mistaken perceptions about safety with more and more people settled in ""formerly"" danger areas.

The complacent attitude about ""successful"" mitigations of danger (that you seem to have) is in part what creates the ever growing danger. Hope this helps you see that.

They massively dispersed their combat forces thereby weakening every one of the scores of different axes of advance and complicating resupply.

They basically didn't bother with logistics.

That ideal hasn't quite happened. 

But making matters worse, Russian NCOs dating back to the Soviet days were.... brutal on the troops. You have to understand that compared to western officers, even a lowly lieutenant or captain in the Russian army has WAY more responsibilities and authority, but are also micromanaged more as well. Russian officers do the thinking so the conscripts dont have to. But that means there is a huge divide, conscripts are considered untrustworthy out of action and unreliable in it. Officers dont have time to win over their troops and are taught to expect compliance. NCOs are pulled in a thousand directions at once especially in the Sgt. rank. Rather than employing *espirt du corps* or a shared sense of identity or an obligation to the unit or any of things western officers use to bridge this gap, Russian NCOs use violence and brutality. Which disenfranchises the conscript soldier and exacerbates the natural human tendency to laziness. It also means that conscripts who decide to move up to contract NCOs have internalized this system and, perhaps, even like it. 

And the junior officers dont care because theyre getting shit own from their own higher ups, who expect total conformity to orders from the platoons and companies. Plus they agree with the implicit assumption. The conscripts arnt worth anything and NCOs are brutes so why trust either? 

Its a huge culture divide which is reflective of a larger class divide in Russia, one which we dont really have an analogue to in the west.

India is not as clear cut a case. They'll certainly try to remain neutral although if things get bad enough they could do the bare minimum of public drnouncments while retaining relations in practice (most likely course of action if this blows up). Maybe even go a little further for opportunistic deals with The West in exchange for denouncement, canceled deals, or mild sanction support. It would take a lot to convince India to burn Russian relations and force them to chose a side firmly in the coming decades. Vaguely possible but unlikely. The arms supply diversity and remaining untied as much as possible to China or The West is more important than the deaths of others far away.

Russian state media published this yesterday, judge for yourself: https://archive.ph/2022.04.04-073603/https://ria.ru/20220403/ukraina-1781469605.html",2a743767221383255edb8c1b99b58841b3fdd311,True,False,,,,,0,1649204157,,0,{},i3k8riv,False,t3_twtnw3,False,True,t1_i3k0477,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/twtnw3/ukraine_megathread_april_5/i3k8riv/,1649204171,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649175357.0

As an observer of Chinese media and social media, what I've seen is that China's support is not only apparently unwavering, but has grown stronger over the coming days. Conjecture is that Xi Jinping didn't like the milquetoast response of some diplomats and media, so he's personally reinforced the party line (unrestrained partnership with Russia).

Evidence: Increased censorship of pro-Ukrainian content. Reinforcement of the bioweapons narrative, reinforcement of Russian propaganda whereby all atrocities are denied or declared to be of Ukraine's own doing. Censorship of content and commentary showing Poland in a positive light (after Poland expressing openness to US nukes being stationed in Poland), encouragement of satirical/demeaning commentary towards Poles.

3. The support base for Russia has always been the authoritarian radical left (tankies, nazbols, MLs, Eastern authoritarians) and authoritarian radical right (/pol/ denizens, Richard Spencer types, outright fascists etc.) The idea that the mainstream right is pro-Russia and there is no pro-Russian sentiment in the left is probably the most successful disinformation campaign that Russian media operators have conducted thus far, certainly a higher calibre than bioweapon pigeons.

Please remember that the H man himself stated that he didn't care for right vs left, he wanted the violent radicals from both sides. I doubt his spiritual successors have changed much.",9cc897a2aa27bb2aaf629cfb0ca9636852a319f1,True,False,,,,,0,1649203971,,0,{},i3k8ch4,False,t3_twtnw3,False,True,t1_i3k0477,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/twtnw3/ukraine_megathread_april_5/i3k8ch4/,1649203989,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649175171.0
