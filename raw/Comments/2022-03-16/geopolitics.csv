War map for the evening of March 16

Southern Front. As part of a ""large-scale counterattack"", AFU forces struck an airfield near Kharkiv. Our troops shelled a facility (presumably a fuel and lubricant depot) near Nikopol. The Russian Armed Forces are pulling their equipment in this direction. In Mariupol, there is more action than anything else. Our forces have made good progress towards the center of the city, and many districts are already under our control. Finally, they began to evacuate people - more than 30,000 people left during the day. In the afternoon, the Drama Theater building was blown up: the Russian Ministry of Defense said that no aviation or artillery were operating in the city of Mariupol today. Apparently the building was blown up by Azov retreating fighters. It is still unclear whether there are civilians under the rubble.

On the rest of the Donbas front: heavy fighting continues in Huliaypil. In Ugledar, AFU forces began to retreat from the city. From Avdeevka to Horlivka small advances. Verkhnetoretskoye is reported to have been cleared, expect fighting for New York (Donetsk). The LNR army is fighting for Rubizhne, Severodonetsk is blockaded, and there are battles in the outskirts.

There is still fighting in Izyum. Remember, we previously wrote about the peninsula to the south of the city, on which the trained forces of the AFU are tightly entrenched?  Well, they are still holding their ground. Ours bypassed them, and they are essentially in a cauldron.  According to our data, this is the 81st Separate Airmobile Brigade, a military unit that is part of the Airborne Assault Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Our troops, on the other hand, continued their offensive southward toward Slavyansk, and if successful, they will close the large Donetsk cauldron.

Key Takeaways:

Russia is deploying reserves from Armenia and South Ossetia and cohering new battalion tactical groups (BTGs) from the remnants of units lost early in the invasion. These reinforcements will likely face equal or greater command and logistics difficulties to current frontline Russian units.

President Zelensky created a new joint military-civilian headquarters responsible for the defense of Kyiv on March 15.

Russian forces conducted several failed attacks northwest of Kyiv and no offensive operations northeast of Kyiv on March 16.

Russian forces continue to shell civilian areas of Kharkiv, but will be unlikely to force the city to surrender without encircling it—which Russian forces appear unable to achieve.

Russian forces continued to reduce the Mariupol pocket on March 16. Russian forces continue to commit war crimes in the city, targeting refugees and civilian infrastructure.

Ukrainian Forces claimed to have killed the commander of the 8th Combined Arms Army’s 150th Motor Rifle Division near Mariupol on March 15. If confirmed, Miyaev would be the fourth Russian general officer killed in Ukraine; his death would be a major blow to the 150th Motor Rifle Division, Russia’s principal maneuver unit in Donbas.

Russian warships shelled areas of Odesa Oblast on March 16 but Russian Naval Infantry remain unlikely to conduct an unsupported amphibious landing.

▪️In the morning of March 16, long-range precision-guided weapons struck Ukrainian military infrastructure. As a result, communication, reconnaissance, retransmission and switching centers in Vinnitsa were knocked out

▪️ LNR troop grouping advances from several directions inside the city of Severodonetsk as it develops its offensive

The Donetsk People's Republic troops are fighting to take control of the village of Marinka. Advance of 2 km on the day

▪️The SBU, with the support of Western countries, is preparing a poisonous provocation in Ukraine to blame Russia

▪️ There are no chemical munitions in Russian Armed Forces units involved in a special military operation

▪️To stop provocations by nationalists with poisonous substances, the Russian military in liberated territory takes dangerous facilities under control and ensures their safety

▪️One Ukrainian Mi-24 helicopter near the village of Sarany and six unmanned aerial vehicles were shot down in the air by Russian air force and air defence assets during the day

▪️Operational-tactical, army and unmanned aerial vehicles hit 34 Ukrainian military facilities. These included one multiple rocket launcher, three command posts, one electronic warfare station, seven ammunition depots and 19 ammunition storage sites

-180 aircraft and helicopters
-166 unmanned aerial vehicles
-1367 tanks and other armoured combat vehicles

[],False,,weilim,,,[],,,,text,t2_uhiu,False,False,"First, when North Korea attacked South Korea, the US made commitments to defend Taiwan, which hadn't existed before. The US prior to that was ready to let Mao invade Taiwan.

[The legacy of the Korean War: Impact on U.S.-Taiwan relations](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03023495)

&gt;If there had not been a Korean War, the Chinese Communists would probably have invaded Taiwan in 1950. After the outbreak of the Korean War, the United States began to reverse its hands-off policy toward the Chinese Nationalists on Taiwan. The Korean War first compelled the United States to grant military aid to Taiwan and then put the island under U.S. protection. The war forestalled the deterioration of the ROC’s international status, but the legal status of Taiwan became undetermined in the eyes of U.S. policymakers. U.S. economic aid prevented Taiwan from sliding into an economic depression in the 1950s, and greatly contributed to the island’s later economic takeoff.

What the Ukraine invasion does is show that the US and allies will impose sanctions on Russia, which could foretell what would happen to China if they invaded Taiwan. It also strengthens the Taiwanese resolve to defend itself. They most likely postpone an invasion.

There is a common view in China that the Soviets and DPRK had launched an invasion of South Korea without knowledge of China. [This has been disproven with recent archives.](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/china-north-korea-and-origins-korean-war) As the link shows, most likely Stalin pressured Mao into supporting the War, even though Mao had reservations about invading South Korea. 

&gt;Mao had several reservations. He apparently believed that the United States would mobilize Japanese forces to participate in a counterattack. He also claimed that the CCP could not “give quick substantial support” at this time, due its own war that was still raging in the south of China. Perhaps by the beginning of 1950, after Chiang Kai-shek’s forces had been fully defeated, conditions would be riper. Mao reminded Kim Il that, of course, such a decision could be reached only after “coordinating” with Stalin.  
  
Judging from subsequent remarks made by Mao, the latter account seems more plausible. In October 1949, Mao shared with Stalin his frustration that the North Koreans were not heeding his words closely enough. Mao apparently learned, via intelligence collected by the CCP, that the North Koreans had been taking steps since June to launch a military offensive against the south. They had even sent “large groups of cadre to South Korea to perform underground work in order to prepare an action in October.”  
  
The uprising that the North Koreans were counting on that summer or fall came to naught. Mao was irritated. He believed the North Koreans had seriously erred, and were now at a political disadvantage vis-à-vis South Korea and the United States. “This spring I gave advice to a representative of North Korea,” he confided in Stalin, that “they ought to take a defensive position and that they ought not wage an offensive for the time being.”

As for Xi and China, [there are two questions about his meeting with Putin where he said the following.](https://www.npr.org/2022/02/08/1079112810/parsing-the-meaning-of-the-xi-putin-meeting-on-the-sidelines-of-the-beijing-olym)

&gt;The two men declared there were no limits to their strategic partnership. And they went further, too. In a statement, China backed Russia's demand to stop the NATO expansion to the East. The countries took aim at the U.S. with a promise to, quote, ""counter interference by outside forces in the internal affairs of sovereign countries under any pretext.

How much did Xi know about the invasion? 

1. Did he know about it, and thought it was going to be easy. If this is true, all the recent statements by the Chinese are to save face and distance themselves from Russia.
2. They didn't know, and hence they were duped.

My point is that Russia really, really doesn't want to see Ukraine in NATO or NATO in Ukraine and will do everything it can to stop that. That's why any kind of plan that relies on 'winning' a war with Russia over that was bound to fail at a great cost to Ukraine.

I believe there is a room for compromise - full takeover of Ukraine hasn't and will not work - Russia basically has to accept Ukraine will remain independent (if they every though differently). However, Ukraine has to understand Russia, with Putin or someone else as leader, will never tolerate Ukraine's NATO membership.

It's this type of influence that Putin is not prepared to give up in Ukraine.

&gt;if anything they're behaving less heavy handed compared to what we've seen come out of their playbook in locations like Chechnya, and have definitely been less overwhelming with artillery and missile power (focusing more on precision strikes).

Tell that to the people of Mariupol and Kharkiv.

They do not have full air control and in fact lose convoys to drone strikes every day. On video.

If they had air control that jet wouldn't be flying in the first place. And Russian aircraft have been mauled by Ukrainian air defenses and ground raids as well.

This simply isn't true, they're miles away from Kyiv. We can see literally all of this on publicly available satellite imagery.

Idea that freedom is more valuable than anything else is tempting, but in the extremes it becomes absurd.

&gt;And, ""no country can do whatever they want"" is just shameful apologia for Russian imperialism.

I'm not excusing Russians, but simply stating Russian imperialism is bad isn't going to stop it. Repeating that Putin is a war criminal won't stop Putin from blowing up more hospitals and committing more war crimes if he wants so.

&gt;The Baltic states joined NATO and they can do whatever they want.

They can do whatever they want because they're in NATO. Ukraine isn't and they can't. Russia will do a lot of violence to prevent them from joining, so it's clear they're not going to be able to do as they please in the near future. It's unfair, but complaining about it won't change that.

&gt;The war and devastation in Ukraine are the unlawful and reprehensible actions of the Russians and the Russians alone, and the people who want try to float a different truth will spend the rest of their lives intellectually and morally isolated from the rest of humanity on this issue (at least), just like Nazi and Soviet apologists after those wars.

Despite being unlawful and reprehensible, those things are still happening. If Ukraine can't actually prevent that, complaints will have no effect.

Closer to actual membership not, but they were arming themselves and overtime the balance of force would become less in favor of Russia than it is now. That's probably one of the reasons why Putin decided to invade.

&gt;Because we don't get to decide this. This is up to Ukrainians. As a matter of geopolitics, Western world recognizes Ukraine as a sovereign and independent nation that can make its own decisions. And they're fighting for that right now.

They're definitely ones making the decision, but I feel like a lot of people here really want to believe their decision is the best/right one, in spite of lots of reasons why it's not.

Ukraine and Russia draw up neutrality plan to end war

Fifteen-point draft deal would involve Kyiv renouncing Nato ambitions in return for security guarantees


Ukraine and Russia have made significant progress on a tentative 15-point peace plan including a ceasefire and Russian withdrawal if Kyiv declares neutrality and accepts limits on its armed forces, according to three people involved in the talks. 

The proposed deal, which Ukrainian and Russian negotiators discussed in full for the first time on Monday, would involve Kyiv renouncing its ambitions to join Nato and promising not to host foreign military bases or weaponry in exchange for protection from allies such as the US, UK and Turkey, the people said. 

The nature of western guarantees for Ukrainian security — and their acceptability to Moscow — could yet prove to be a big obstacle to any deal, as could the status of Ukrainian territories seized by Russia and its proxies in 2014. A 1994 agreement underpinning Ukrainian security failed to prevent Russian aggression against its neighbour.

Although Moscow and Kyiv both said that they had made progress on the terms of a deal, Ukrainian officials remain sceptical Russian president Vladimir Putin is fully committed to peace and worry that Moscow could be buying time to regroup its forces and resume its offensive. Putin showed no sign of compromise on Wednesday, vowing Moscow would achieve all of its war aims in Ukraine. 

“We will never allow Ukraine to become a stronghold of aggressive actions against our country,” he said.

Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, told the Financial Times that any deal would involve “the troops of the Russian Federation in any case leaving the territory of Ukraine” captured since the invasion began on February 24 — namely southern regions along the Azov and Black seas, as well as territory to the east and north of Kyiv. 

Ukraine would maintain its armed forces but would be obliged to stay outside military alliances such as Nato and refrain from hosting foreign military bases on its territory. 

Putin’s press secretary Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday that neutrality for Ukraine based on the status of Austria or Sweden was a possibility.

 “This option is really being discussed now, and is one that can be considered neutral,” said Peskov.

 Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, said that “absolutely specific wordings” were “close to being agreed” in the negotiations.",a8054a0da2caa6e014f5afa1be97e09dc3502604,True,False,,,,,0,1647445981,,0,{},i0wc6ax,False,t3_t0cgvt,False,True,t3_t0cgvt,/r/geopolitics/comments/t0cgvt/ukraine_megathread_all_new_posts_go_here_so_long/i0wc6ax/,1647445998,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647417181.0,

&gt;Despite the enormous potential of Ukraine’s energy reserves, there are   
non-trivial costs to developing Ukraine’s capabilities. According to an   
assessment study  
 by the Ukrainian Institute for the Future, a transformation of Ukraine   
into a self-sufficient energy consumer and potential exporter would   
require a number of investments amounting to approximately US$19.5   
billion. Of this amount, about US$3.5 billion are needed for developing   
gas fields and building pipelines, US$14 billion would have to be   
invested into oil extraction, and US$2 billion would go toward oil   
refining.  
&gt;  
&gt;The overall size of the investment needed to achieve the  
 goal of full energy independence constitutes a considerable amount   
compared to Ukraine’s relatively small state budget and GDP. Nevertheless, the sum only equals the approximate costs for current   
Ukrainian energy imports over the span of two to three years. Thus, the   
relatively high absolute cost would amortize itself quickly.",69501d19c7630ced2af0dcfe6dd2bcdd593878db,True,False,,,,,0,1647445245,,0,{},i0wacgz,False,t3_tfa2at,False,True,t1_i0w77ps,/r/geopolitics/comments/tfa2at/why_did_putin_choose_to_attack_ukraine_right_now/i0wacgz/,1647445256,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647416445.0,

The book makes an important distinction between 'contested autocracies' where the Leader's immediate subordinates can collectively check or even overthrow the leader, and 'established autocracies' where the leader can do what he pleases. So for example a kingdom where the monarch has to listen to the nobility and other elites would be a contested autocracy, while an absolute monarchy would be an established autocracy.

As the author notes, in authoritarian regimes there is a constant tug of war between the leader and his barons. The purpose of formal institutions such as legislatures is so the barons can coordinate and keep on the leader in case he gathers too much power or gets too crazy. It can happen though that a cycle occurs where the leader manages to win over his barons, which weakens the baron's ability to restrain the leader, which allows the leader to gain even more power. You can see how in 20 years Russia has gone from a flawed democracy to a personalist dictatorship as Putin slowly but steadily excluded more and more people from power.",945e03c95cd8bfc53b0fdd961f002ea42b1daf3b,True,False,,,,,0,1647443757,,0,{},i0w6o6y,False,t3_tfj6jl,False,False,t3_tfj6jl,/r/geopolitics/comments/tfj6jl/xi_jinpings_faltering_foreign_policy_the_war_in/i0w6o6y/,1647443769,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647414957.0,

You might be right about that, but that's not how I see it. He puts forward two possibilities (that's a logical fallacy) - war around 2022 or ""colonization"" around 2030 and gives the best options as victory in that war.

My overall impression is the Arestovych prefers the war because he basically dismissed any alternative except ""colonization"". For instance, why couldn't they fight back the ""colonization""? If that's impossible, why wouldn't chances for victory be even lower because Russia will devote its entire war machine to that war?

&gt;Make up your mind. Was he right or was he wrong?

He was wrong in the sense that Putin invaded believing he'd be able to perform regime change and performed few attacks against infrastructure. Devastation wasn't plan A. It's becoming plan B.

&gt;The second option was not to ""just wait"". It was to do what Russia told them to do, this means stuff like electing pro-russian government officials, letting Russia propaganda do its work in Ukraine, and be eventually absorbed by them.

Okay, I see what you mean. I disagree.

Isn't some degree of accommodation of Russian interests expected? I mean no country can truly do whatever they want. Every country is bound by how other countries react. In case of Ukraine that borders a much stronger Russia, they have to adjust their policy to that. Now, of course Ukrainians want to be independent - but I'm convinced they could do that assuming they don't do anything Russia considers a great threat (so no NATO membership), align with some issues with Russia while maintaining a good enough army that a whimsical invasion would have a negative cost benefit calculation for Russia.

I mean a plan that involves defeating a several times larger and better armed country that has 6000 nukes in a conflict regarding what it perceives to be a key security issue is a really horrible plan. Like, at 90% of the times it ends in a disaster and defeat. Majority of the times 'victory' is possible that will be a truly pyrrhic victory.

In my opinion trying to perform such a geopolitical realignment is unlikely to work, would cost too much and should not be considered if a viable alternative exists.

Imagine if Mexico wanted really hard to join a China-led alliance and hoped to win an ensuing war against the US over that alliance. Sure, US has much larger military than Russia (and disbalance is greater), but the overall problem is the same. Everyone here would consider that completely foolish. Why can't we accept this idea is completely unpragmatic and will most likely end horribly for Ukraine? 

7% of their population have already become refugees. Most of them will not return to the poorest (or 2nd poorest) country in Europe. Given that men aged 18-60 can't leave the country families are separated and those family members that remain will likely emigrate if they survive the war. Add the economic damage, increasing brain drain and you'll see that Ukraine will be ruined by this war.

I hope I'm not the only one to think his plan is totally insane. He thought that if Ukraine doesn't get invaded (like now) by Russia between 2020-2022, they will certainly become ""colonized"" within ten years, and believes the war is preferable because they plan on winning.  Further, he guessed Russia's goal in the war would to be to ""devastate"" the country. He was wrong about this, Putin planned to do regime change with little resistance, but he'll probably revert to devastation now that regime change is impossible in order to punish Ukraine. How does he conclude Ukraine can win against Russia that's bent on total destruction? And why would they be unable to better fight for their own independence in 10 years than now?

The interview also shows advisor's binary thinking - there aren't only two options. Russia will likely never tolerate a hostile Ukraine, and although they might like annexing Ukraine at some point in the future, if the cost of that is too high, they'll likely drop the idea.

By the way, this means that while Zelensky was telling Ukrainians that he sees no signs of war, his advisor knew it was certain and imminent.

But, in 2012 large oil and natural gas deposits were discovered in Ukraine.  Ukraine itself didn't have the resources to develop its own fossil fuel extraction industry,  but it could get foreign investors to partner with them and get the industry going that way.

Now, Russia depends on selling its fuels to Europe.  Some estimates have fuel sales accounting for as much as half of the Russian governments funding, so it's extremely important to them.  And the new deposits in Ukraine represent a viable alternative to Russian fuel.  This has the potential to ruin Russia.

So the first plan was simply to use then president Yanukovych, who was in Putin's pocket. Ukraine was all set to sign up with European partners to help develop their industries and economy, a widely popular idea in the nation. 

But then, bam!  At the last minute Yanukovych scraps the deal with the EU and says he's going with Russia instead.  Not popular.  This served as the catalyst for the Euromaidan movement against Yanukovych, and it worked because he was eventually driven from the nation.

Not long after Yanukovych is driven out what should happen the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine rebell with Russian help, and Putin silently invades Crimea and annexes into to Russia.  

A few years later though, the clock is ticking.  Ukraine hasn't backed down in their bid to move closer to Europe and NATO, and Putin can't just let it happen, because as mentioned it could ruin Russia.  So...he invades.

In conclusion, even without the CIA, everything that has happened makes sense.  Now it's perfectly possible the CIA is participating, but I don't think they started the whole thing.  Ukraine became a threat to Russia not for any military reason,  but an economic one, fuel.",869d67bcae7043dc742c46365d460d1c600d375d,True,False,,,,,0,1647434926,,0,{},i0vmskh,False,t3_tfa2at,False,True,t3_tfa2at,/r/geopolitics/comments/tfa2at/why_did_putin_choose_to_attack_ukraine_right_now/i0vmskh/,1647434938,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647406126.0,

Within the NATO alliance or outside it, they formally have a US shield, but even outside it Ukraine would still be a heavily armed client state of the US, which had made the destabilization of Russia a priority.

[],False,,GrAdmThrwn,,,[],,,,text,t2_v46ip,False,False,"I quite enjoy Caspianreport, but I do have to disagree on the conclusion regarding Russia's inability to accept being a lesser partner. 

My opinion on the way Russia conducts itself as a great power, is that they have three major priorities. 

1. Being the king of their corner of the world.   
This being their 'near abroad' and the former Soviet Union. 
2. Recognition of its status as a Great Power.  
More precisely, being recognized as a power that can affect other countries beyond its borders. 
3. Having a guaranteed seat at the table.   
This more or less amounts to not being ignored. Seems to have been a common complaint in the aftermath of NATO expansion and the lead up to the Munich Speech in 2007. 

With that in mind, I do not agree with the conclusion that Russia has an aversion to being perceived as the lesser partner in an arrangement simply because China has no territorial ambitions in Eastern Europe, has no desire to meddle in how the Russians run their country (or their sphere of influence) and has displayed that they are considerate to Russian positions and perspectives throughout the warming of their bilateral relations. 

I think that if Russia had joined NATO when Putin suggested Russia join in 2000, or when Gorbachev floated the notion in 1990, then Russia certainly would have been considered the lesser partner to the United States, but that did not stop them from considering the idea. 

Once again, whether a power is considered the greater or lesser partner in a relationship is more or less irrelevant in my opinion. If Russia can, through strategic partnership with China, achieve its strategic interests, then what does it matter that China is technically the stronger of the two? 

Another important question that surely the Russian leadership must be considering is, ""can Russia safeguard its core strategic interests without China?"". If the answer is 'no', then the possibility of eventually losing influence in Africa and Central Asia is surely the lesser of two evils in the eyes of Russian decision makers.",dd7564eb8a42ae18941f997b2cfb65b590820279,True,False,,,,,0,1647417786,,0,{},i0uz1rn,True,t3_teijzm,False,True,t1_i0ucc8l,/r/geopolitics/comments/teijzm/how_overlapping_core_interests_reinforces_the/i0uz1rn/,1647417803,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647388986.0,

Near zero.

&gt;\- a smaller nuclear weapon used in Ukraine by Russia to intimidate the Ukrainians into surrendering.

Which would land them in sanctions so deep for so long as to guarantee a pyric victory at the best. Even China would balk at a rogue nuclear state on their doorstep.

&gt;\- more nuclear weapons used by Russia in Eastern Europe to stun NATO and make it back off from Ukraine altogether.

Nuking countries to ""stun"" them will absolutely not get them to back off, that's just a ridiculous idea. It would be an instant world war, and Russia's allies are not going to go to war with the rest of the world to back up Putin's failing imperial venture here.

&gt;I am aware that these scenarios are a bit extreme but seeing how Russia stands to lose in Ukraine no matter what it does it seems logical that Putin would try to escalate further.

Ukraine could push Russia all the way back out of Crimea, force them to pay reparations, and the current sanction could never reverse and it would still pale before the loss Russia would sustain if they even prepped a nuke to be used offensively.

&gt;To defeat the Taliban in the aftermath of 9/11, the CIA successfully mobilized former warlords long active in the heroin trade to seize towns and cities across eastern Afghanistan. In other words, the Agency and its local allies created ideal conditions for reversing the Taliban's opium ban and reviving the drug traffic. Only weeks after the collapse of the Taliban, officials were reporting an outburst of poppy planting in the heroin heartlands of Helmand and Nangarhar. 

Of course, I don't have a smoking gun proving intelligence is funded by drugs. We just have to look at how they are active in drug trafficking areas, and how they protect their drug trafficking allies from local police.

They were tasked with training and advising a afghan army unit. A large element (several thousand) of well trained let fighters came to a small village in their area of operations and cut the heads off district leaders and local cops, and displayed them on a government building along with their flag. They flew us in to back them up because the Americans that were stationed there were rightfully concerned that if they went out to meet them, their outposts would be taken. The assault lasted I think 2 months, and was hot the whole time. By the end, the afghan forces were deserting, and afghan leaders were shooting themselves to get medevaced out. The Latvians, as far as I could tell, took direct control over the afghan forces that remained, and eventually fell in with us essentially acting as a OP fire team.

  These guys, aside from being cool as crap and down to earth we're imposing. We decided at one point we liked them enough to jump them in, and one of them stood his ground against 15 or so of us. At one point we got word that a sniper was in the village, and sprinted out to catch him because he had been causing us alot of trouble. It turned out to be a large ambush, and we spent the next few hours going door to door and getting spread out. I found out later that our sharp shooter and the Latvian sniper dropped something like 20 fighters from their position on a hill that had attempted to sneak up on just me and another guy, and who knows how many others.

War map for the evening of March 15

As blasphemous as it may sound, the 20th day of military operations was the ""most boring"" according to news reports. According to the Russian Defense Ministry tradition, a number of high-precision strikes on AFU targets were carried out during the day, in particular the bombing of the airport in Dnepropetrovsk was reported. Explosions were also heard in Odessa, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, and Chernihiv Regions.

On the fronts in Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and Kyiv, there is little change. There are artillery strikes, exchanges of fire and positional battles. Of interest is the beginning of a breakthrough near Gorlovka. In the northeast of Donetsk, it is noted that during the night they were heavily ironing Avdeevka with everything they could. In eight years, the AFU has managed to entrench here quite seriously, with three lines of defense. From the south, our troops continue to move here, flanking Ugledar and advancing towards Pokrovsk. But in Gulyaypol, our forces were pushed back to their previous positions, reportedly by the AFU counterattack. To the north of the Donetsk cauldron, our troops are fighting their way from Izyum to Slavyansk. Serious gunfire is reported. The LNR army next door is clenching its fist around the Severodetsk-Rubezhnoye agglomeration, with fighting already taking place inside populated areas.

On the Mariupol direction, there are battles, which are compared to ""Grozny"" in '99. The Donetsk People's Republic reported that the 53rd brigade of the AFU was completely defeated, having suffered large-scale losses.

The AFU today reported a personnel reshuffle in the top command staff. A new commander of Ukraine's OOS was appointed.

Tochka-U missiles are striking Donetsk again, with arrivals today in the residential area of Makiivka. And in a number of localities, civilian populations were evacuated along green corridors, which is nothing short of encouraging.

That is all for today, but we continue to monitor the situation.

Key Takeaways:

Russian forces are unlikely to launch offensive operations to encircle Kyiv larger than the scattered Russian attacks observed northwest of Kyiv targeting Irpin on March 14 and Guta-Mezhyhirska on March 15 within the coming week but may launch further tactical attacks.

Russian forces continued to assault Mariupol from the east and west.

Russian forces did not conduct major offensive operations toward northeastern Kyiv in the past 24 hours.

Russian forces attempting to encircle Kharkiv continue to face supply shortages, particularly regarding ammunition.

The Russian military falsely claimed to have captured the entirety of Kherson Oblast on March 15 but did not conduct any major operations toward either Zaporizhya or Mykolayiv.

Russia is unlikely to launch an unsupported amphibious operation against Odesa until Russian forces secure a ground line of communication to the city, but Russian Naval Infantry retain the capability to conduct a landing along the Black Sea coast.

Caspianresport did a video on this relationship a while back: [https://youtu.be/AGafVj-wrmw](https://youtu.be/AGafVj-wrmw) 

They say that yes on the surface an alliance between Russia and China looks very natural but Russia would sooner or later need to assume the role as the lesser partner and that is not acceptable to Russia so they will always maintain a comfortable distance and attempt to balance the relationship with other powers.

With Russian influence dwindling its China that will step in as the alternative power in the world. Its China that will compete with Russia over influence in Central Asia and Africa etc and thats the end of Russia as a global power so its a definite no-go for Russia.

Strategic Partnership is not about common values or friendship or shared positive history. Its about lack of conflicting interests, overlapping regional goals and complementary needs/wants.

In addition to all your points listed above, I would also like to add that the reason for India using Russian equipment is very pragmatic. India needs Russian military equipment because India maintains an independent foreign policy and needs to be able to secure technology sharing rights in order to be confident that they can produce their equipment domestically if need be, to prevent being cut off by the exporter (something the US has proven it is willing to do time and time again).

A lot of members as well as NATO themselves have outright said that membership can happen within a day of either or both countries applying for it which eliminates the most vulnerable period for potential member states.

There is also the minor issue of how to address a POTUS like Trump who supposedly was planning to leave NATO at the start of his second term had he won the election.

1. Helped communist china post 1962 war become the permanent member of the UNSC?

2. mobilized nuclear armed naval fleets to threaten india?

[],False,,GrAdmThrwn,,,[],,,,text,t2_v46ip,False,False,"My personal take is that *prior* to the crisis, the US could have arranged some sort of compromise that satisfied Russia's immediate concerns in Eastern Europe, but I don't think they could have turned them into an ally *against* China. 

My understanding of how the Russian leadership perceives the United States is that from the moment NATO began expanding beyond Germany (1999 onwards), the necessary bar for compromise, reconciliation and restored trust in US/Russian relations has gotten higher and higher. 

That said, I have failed to find evidence that Russia actively began pursuing international policies that ran counter to Western Interests until after 2007 onwards. I think realism is a big part of this, due to Russia simply not having been in a position to oppose the eastward expansion of NATO until then. However, there is something to be said on the notion that the Russian's simply weren't willing to risk opposing the West until it was made clear that NATO intended to include Ukraine and that Russia ultimately had no say in the matter. (Bucharest Summit, 2008, I believe). 

What I think John Mearsheimer is referring to is the lost opportunity the US had in the 90s to approach Russia differently. Prior to the expansion of NATO, there was a very real opportunity to position Russia as an ally and with their strategic concerns in Eastern Europe completely secure in that respect, it would not be a farcry to assume that Russia would be far more willing to suppport Western Military action in Asia. 

Now, however, after China has extended an economic lifeline to Russia in the face of sanctions from the West, I fear that nothing short of a complete US policy shift, either towards active non-interventionism, or an abandonment of NATO/defanging of the alliance, will convince the Russian's that they do not need China as a counterweight to the West.",de52963d3872c4fc0cfd8cc1a2f64197b70fdce2,True,False,,,,,0,1647396469,,0,{},i0u095f,True,t3_teijzm,False,True,t1_i0trydm,/r/geopolitics/comments/teijzm/how_overlapping_core_interests_reinforces_the/i0u095f/,1647396485,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647367669.0,

[],False,,LemmingPractice,,,[],,,,text,t2_1hfhp15q,False,False,"I think the part you are missing is that American moves regarding energy security aren't moves to secure supplies for the US, they are moves to secure supply for strategic allies. 

North America is energy independent, with American and Canadian production providing plenty of supply. Europe, however, is not energy independent by a long shot, which we are seeing right now. Even in the face of war in Europe, the European community is too dependent on Russian oil and gas to embargo them.

Russia is a petro-state, for all intents and purposes. Oil and gas represent 40% of all government revenues and 60% of exports. The war is being funded by oil money, and Europe has no choice but to keep funding the Kremlin.

It's not just Europe, either. Asian partners like Japan and South Korea need energy imports constantly in order to keep their economies running.

The American global order is about keeping trade open. The most important trade to keep open is energy, because, like it or not, the world still runs on hydrocarbons. If the Americans can't keep supply lines of energy open for their allies, then they are allowing other countries, like Russia, to gain soft power over those countries, and risks their influence eroding in key strategic regions.

&gt;It is widely held that Russia invaded Ukraine for their oil and gas capacity. Russia has plenty domestic capacity that it can't even tap on its own, they literally invite companies like Exxon, Shell, and BP to develop them. In a world where we move toward renewables and infrastructure is expensive, nobody has a lot of interest in starting from scratch with Ukrainian gas and oil.

Russia didn't invade Ukraine for its own supply needs. Russia's primary market for its exports is Europe, and Ukraine presented a potential large competitor in this marketplace. Not only was Ukraine in the early stages of developing its newly discovered natural gas reserves, but Ukraine already has a number of pipelines to Europe installed in the country from Soviet era days.

A large chunk of the gas deposits are in the Black Sea, in the exclusive economic zone off the coast of Crimea. Another large chunk is in the current disputed separatist regions. By taking those regions, the Russians have gained control over most of Ukraine's reserves, and the war has crippled any capacity Ukraine would have had to develop the remaining resources in the near future.

A world powered by renewables is still a very long way away, and that reality is even moreso for countries in Eastern Europe and Asia. For the foreseeable future, we still live in a world powered by hydrocarbons. In a world where peak oil has been ""a decade or two"" away for over 50 years now, it is naive to ignore the reality of the world we live in.",aba059da93bd3a9b909eb3520edd68a2b187b498,True,False,,,,,0,1647394156,,0,{},i0tuz0r,False,t3_tenm86,False,False,t1_i0sqmkz,/r/geopolitics/comments/tenm86/reading_a_book_about_the_great_game_for_energy/i0tuz0r/,1647394173,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647365356.0,

The elections that occurred in 2019 were both a reaction against the post Yanukovych government and Yanukovych's own corruption. I think it's fairly obvious to say that the US would not actually want a actor/comedian as the head of Ukraine's government. The fact that Trump had to apply pressure on Zelensky to try and initiate an investigation on Biden I think also shows that Zelensky isn't a puppet that owes allegiance to the US. 

Ultimately let's say that the US did coup Yanukovych and installed Poroshenko. By 2019 that coup was essentially nullified by Zelensky's victory in the election where he faced Poroshenko. The Ukrainian far right alliance couldn't even meet the threshold of 2.5%, the government is mostly lead by catch all centrist parties. The majority party is new and is named after Zelensky's TV show. So why does this coup matter at this point? Does a coup government having existed justify a Russian invasion almost 3 years after it largely left power?
