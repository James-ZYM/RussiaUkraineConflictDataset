[],False,,Unlikely-Contest-506,,,[],,,,text,t2_hal6h2gu,False,False,"Briefing by the official representative of the RF Ministry of Defense Igor Konashenkov as of 19.30 March 16, 2022
 
▪️ The grouping of troops of the Lugansk People's Republic, developing the offensive, are moving forward from several directions inside the city of SEVERODONETSK.

▪️ Units of the Donetsk People's Republic are fighting for the capture of the settlement of MARYINKA. Moving forward for the day amounted to 2 kilometers.

▪️ On the morning of March 16, high-precision long-range weapons attacked the military infrastructure of Ukraine. As a result, communication, reconnaissance, relaying and switching centers in the village of VINNITSA were put out of action.

▪️ During the day, aviation and air defense systems of the Russian Aerospace Forces shot down one Ukrainian Mi-24 helicopter in the air near the village of SARANA, as well as six unmanned aerial vehicles.

▪️ Operational-tactical, army and unmanned aircraft hit 34 military facilities of Ukraine.
Of these, one installation of a multiple launch rocket system, three command posts, one electronic warfare station, seven ammunition depots and 19 military equipment accumulation sites.

▪️ In total, since the beginning of the special military operation, 180 aircraft and helicopters, 166 unmanned aerial vehicles, 1367 tanks and other armored combat vehicles, 132 multiple launch rocket systems, 502 field artillery and mortar guns, as well as 1156 units of special military vehicles have been destroyed.

▪️ We know for certain that with the support of Western countries, the SBU is preparing a provocation using poisonous substances against civilians.

The purpose of the provocation is to accuse Russia of using chemical weapons against the population of Ukraine.
I would like to officially state that the units of the Russian Armed Forces involved in the special military operation do not and cannot have chemical munitions.

The Russian Federation, unlike the United States, has long fulfilled its international obligations by completely destroying all stockpiles of chemical weapons.

To stop any provocations of Ukrainian nationalists with poisonous substances, Russian military personnel in the liberated territory take control of dangerous objects and ensure their safety.

▪️ Among the combat documentation captured by us in the 4th brigade of the Ukrainian National Guard there is a detailed map of the territory of Ukraine with objects marked on it and types of stored poisonous substances. Therefore, any attempt to provoke the SBU with the use of poisonous substances will inevitably be revealed.

▪️ We have repeatedly cited facts about the atrocities of nationalists who terrorize civilians for any disobedience or attempts to leave settlements.

Today, at the same time, video footage of civilians who died in Chernihiv, who were allegedly “shot by Russian servicemen,” were distributed on all propaganda resources of the Kiev regime. It was indicated that all the dead allegedly stood in line for bread.

I want to emphasize that there were no Russian servicemen in Chernihiv, and there are none.

All units of the Russian armed forces are outside Chernihiv, blocking the roads, and no offensive actions are being taken against the city.

On the video footage replicated by Ukrainian propagandists, there are no traces of ammunition explosions.

All windows in nearby buildings are intact. There are no damages to the walls, there are no other traces of the explosion on the ground. Thus, all the dead people - the victims of the terror of Ukrainian nationalists or these video frames - are another production by the SBU.

▪️ We would like to draw your attention to the fact that simultaneously with the Ukrainian Internet resources, this fake was published on the official pages of the US Embassy in Ukraine on social networks without any verification and obtaining evidence.

At the same time, the embassy itself, as you know, has long been located not even in Kyiv, but in Lvov. And point-blank does not notice how Russian military personnel deliver and distribute hundreds of tons of humanitarian aid to residents of the Chernihiv region in settlements liberated from nationalists.",d020f8858b43366987bb2ee2bd7733e4da7164c5,True,False,,,,,0,1647475019,,0,{},i0ycfnq,False,t3_tfg7e3,False,False,t3_tfg7e3,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tfg7e3/ukraine_megathread_march_16/i0ycfnq/,1647475036,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647446219.0,

[],False,,Brendissimo,,,[],,,,text,t2_2hb1oq,False,False,"That was definitely an interesting analysis. And I do agree that it may be past time to trade some urban areas for the survival of key military units. The WW2 armchair general part of my brain has been thinking since the beginning that the Ukrainians should dig in and hold along the Dnieper. But that kind of thinking ignores one of the major realities of modern war - conflicts often come to an end not when one side achieves total military victory, but when both sides are convinced to negotiate, often under intense international pressure and scrutiny. In that context, holding on to every single scrap of territory you can make sense. Violating ceasefires to gain a few hundred meters can even make sense. Russia definitely has not committed enough troops to occupy Ukraine in its entirety, and Ukraine certainly does not possess the ability to drive on to Moscow and force Putin to capitulate. So some kind of negotiated peace is likely. Therefore the Ukrainian desire to hold on to territory (especially Donetsk and Luhansk) makes a lot of sense.

But which cities would be worth giving up? Due to its symbolic and economic value, and general importance for national unity, I don't think Kiev is worth giving up without a fight under any circumstances (as the author seems to suggest). However, there are some areas where Ukraine could have or perhaps should have withdrawn from. Ukrainian forces in Chernihiv and Sumy, for example, seem to be at risk of being completely surrounded, while a Russian thrust towards Kiev from the East has stretched narrowly across Ukraine. I don't know if the Ukrainians have the capability to attempt larger encirclements of their own, but perhaps that's one thing they could use their forces for if they traded space for time and flexibility.

However, even if Ukraine decides to withdraw its forces from an area to consolidate the front or free them up for a counterattack, can they do so effectively? Do their units still possess sufficient vehicles and fuel to redeploy quickly? Can they provide sufficient defenses against Russian aerial ground attacks? As underwhelming as Russian efforts in the air have been thus far, if entire Ukrainian brigades start moving away from the front down major roads, you can bet Russian helicopters and attack planes will attempt to harass them.

How true is it that the Russians have vast force overmatch in Ukraine, though? According to the latest issue (2022) of the IISS, Ukraine's armed forces have 987 MBTs, 2,196 IFVs/APCs, 1,236 artillery pieces and 360 MRLs. They also have 250 S-300 LRSAM systems, which must explain in part why the Russian VKS isn't performing as expected.

First off, Russia's demographic situation isn't that bad. It's population will decline, according to the latest UN projections, from \~146 million (2020) to \~133 million (2060) and then \~126 million (2100).

Incidentally, Ukraine's demographic prospects are far worse, with a projected decline from \~44 million (2020) to \~32 million (2060) and then \~24 million (2100).

There's simply no evidence that demographic concerns had anything to do with Putin's decision to invade.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

For China the demographic decline is steeper, going from \~1,439 million (2020) to \~1,333 million (2060) and then \~1,065 million (2100). That still leaves China with a population above the billion mark for the rest of the century, however. Unless China succumbs to the so-called ""middle-income trap"", China's power will keep increasing despite its absolute demographic decline.

You mention in passing China's ""bubble-economy"". Despite the latest Evergrande troubles, there's no reason to assume economic implosion. Indeed, even [prudent projections](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/revising-down-rise-china) show China maintaining significant growth for the foreseeable future.

Indeed, over the long term working-age (15-64) population shares converge across the main players. Data is for 2020 / 2060 / 2100:

\-China: .70 / .56 / .54

\-India: .67 / .66 / .59

\-Russia: .66 / .58 / .59

\-United States: .65 / .60 / .57

This gives dependency ratios ranging from 69% (India and Russia) to 85% (China), with the U.S. in the middle at 75%.

Well yeah. It's nonsense. But it's nonsense that benefits me as a member of the 'USA's bitch' club. I find it hilarious everyone complaining about war crimes, as if there is any coherent authority that can actually enforce them. War crimes are something committed by *our* enemies, and only enforced when we've defeated someone. 

I fully support adhering to international law. I regularly attack my own government for shitting all over it. That also means that when my own government starts using international law to beat others with I can happily state that we have no moral authority to do so, because we ourselves do not care about it until it's convenient. the whole thing is a laughable web of hypocrisy and double standards, and until such time as the 'rules' are actually applied evenly i will continue to not sit here foaming at the mouth with faux outrage that someone else has broken them.

The US of course takes it to a whole other level and doesn't even respect the sovereignty of its own allies, but that's a different argument altogether.

&gt; but to hell with Ukraine's autonomy, right

Of course not. fuck putin. He's a dangerous cunt.

The problem is inherently that WE KNEW HE WAS A DANGEROUS CUNT, yet we have spent years engaging in diplomatic actions that we knew would provoke this sort of action on his part. The narrative is that suddenly out of nowhere putin who apparently exists in a vacuum and is immune to events going on around him, decided on a whim that he'd start a major land war. It's frankly outrageous. Something you may not know about me is that i fucking hate misinformation. I hate politicians lying to the public. The one thing i care most about is accurate and nuanced reporting/ understanding of events, not bullshit convenient narratives.  Alas most people also hate misinformation.... only when it's for something they oppose.

It's a fucking terrible analogy, but you don't get to 'poke the bear' repeatedly and then when the bear bites you claim that the bear is some crazed wild animal intent on biting people. It may sell papers, but it's nonsense. How can i hold putin accountable if i'm not allowed to hold my own government accountable? Last year the royal navy sailed a destroyer into russian waters in the black sea. Literally no purpose other than provocation.

&gt; Shouldn't they have known better? Why didn't we make it clear to them that they're a Russian vassal and prevent all of this?

Ironically yes they probably should have known better. They are in a tenuous strategic position and need to tread very carefully with their foreign policy as a result. The same way cuba should have done. Imperialism never died mate. We've just always been on the right side of it so we don't see any of the shitty consequences for small/developing countries that suffer. Or we're so sold on certain narratives that we ardently support it without even caring that it's imperialism. Not to even mention the legitimate ethnic dimension.

&gt; To think that you could look at this war that Putin has initiated and your take is ""if only we had given Putin what he wanted earlier, this tragedy could have been averted!""

Not joining the EU/NATO is.... not a huge concession when the alternative is serious unrest and loss of stability at a minimum. Also once again, countries have the right to apply to join NATO, but nato is under no obligation to accept them. If egypt applied to join nato they would be rightly rejected based on political and diplomatic justifications, regardless how much 'they wanted to join and they're a sovereign country'.

You just keep refusing to acknowledge that ALL diplomatic decisions countries make have consequences. Doesn't matter how noble they are, or how much YOU support them. It's odd, because you acknowledge ukraine's strategic objectives, and you acknowledge the west's strategic objectives. But you pretend that russia doesn't have any, or isn't allowed any.

&gt; Putin should have been deterred, not appeased, 

Have a guess what the easiest  and most effective form of deterrance was? Hint: give no reason for the conflict in the first place.

lol. You know the russians tried to join nato right? They also tried to create a european defence treaty. Both would have accomplished security in eastern europe. The us of course refused because it didn't want to give up its strategic position in europe.

Absolutely, yes.

If you have a force that is dramatically outmatched by your enemy in terms of armor, air capability, and fires, but at rough parity with them in terms of infantry confrontations, it makes the most sense to base your defense almost exclusively around urban areas where you can ensure the greatest volume of infantry fighting.

That's especially true if the only weapon systems you're being supplied with en masse from abroad are infantry-based weapon systems. It's even more true when you know that your enemy's most likely form of attack with be a decapitation, rapid strike meant to perform a fait accompli. It's triply true when you know that your enemy's logistics will be bound towards advancing along narrow road corridors and will hinge on seizing rail hubs. In that scenario, your primary goal will simply be to hold urban centers and delay the offensive as long as possible.

We know cities can be prepared to withstand sieges for months or years, and the Ukrainians have had 8 years to prepare for this conflict. There's every reason to believe they have prepared extensive caches in their cities, and that they are prepared to endure an extended siege.

It's not like this is even all just hypothetical. We can see that this is exactly what the Ukrainians have done. They have done almost no fighting outside of urban areas, and they seem to be holding well even in those areas under heavy siege.",fd67a4b52852d706d648c9d09ec8a58c9f7c9a85,True,False,,,,,0,1647472987,,0,{},i0y7qu4,False,t3_tfotud,False,True,t1_i0y32d2,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tfotud/not_out_of_the_woods_yet_assessing_the/i0y7qu4/,1647473002,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647444187.0,

However, USA never completely subjugated Iraq and can not really be considered a strategic victory for USA. Rather it is one substantial strategic loss for USA.

USA vs Iraq was not a near-peer conflict that Russia vs Ukraine is. Especially not by 2003. The invasion was preceded by a complete destruction of Iraqi air defense, C2 and ground installations.

Iraq never had the national integrity and will to resist US forces. Quite the opposite really, Kurds were actively supporting the invasion and many Iraqis truly did support the toppling of Saddam (even if not perhaps welcoming the US invasion). Russia hoped that Russians in Ukraine would as well, but it was clearly not to be.

This also meant that Iraq never mobilized their entire nation for the war. It did not have the national will to do so, the ability to do so after US bombing campaign nor really the institutional base to do so.

So yes, it is possible to successfully invade a large population country if it is technologically and institutionally sub-par, is domestically divided, lacks a national will to fight and ability to mobilize national resources.

Ukraine is technologically and institutionally near-peer to Russia, is (to Russian surprise) not domestically divided, does have a massive will to fight (should have been obvious to anyone who has followed the developments in Ukraine for the past 8 years) and does have the domestic, as well as international ability to mobilize the nation to the fullest (again a Russian miscalculation, but not a justifiable one).",22c84489de6c53736a26b9a1a62e6e3162f3589b,True,False,,,,,0,1647466129,,0,{},i0xqvee,False,t3_tfotud,False,True,t1_i0xnjbk,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tfotud/not_out_of_the_woods_yet_assessing_the/i0xqvee/,1647466141,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647437329.0,

This has been an interesting part of the reporting. I'm wondering if it has something to do with Reporters only really knowing about/or using conflicts like the US invasions, the Georgia conflict, and maybe the Armenian/Azerbaijani conflicts as their reference. 

The Russian advance was supposed to be like the US advance into Iraq. And it failed in that aspect. But that doesn't equal a complete failure. 

Russia is having a hard/impossible time capitalizing on their gains and their gains are very tentative. But people seem to be glancing by the fact that they are gains.

I don't know if just an actual reporting of the war isn't marketable in the current news ecosystem (which is a hell of a problem) or if they think people are just too dumb to understand and are dumbing it down. 

Although the news today does seem to suggest Ukraine is starting to launch counter offensives that take advantage of the Russia's poor defensive lines. They're not trying to gain territory but to separate and isolate Russian forces and then eradicate them to drive up casualties and losses.

&gt; The war in Ukraine has been dominated by an effective and far-reaching information campaign led by the Ukrainian state. The Ukrainian narrative is dominating both the news and social media cycles, which are now of equal importance in forming public opinion. The narrative is littered with broken Russian convoys, farmers triumphantly towing boutique Russian air defence systems away from their hiding places, and harrowing footage of Russian tank formations being destroyed. And yet, by analysing three maps depicting the operational picture, including one released by the UK’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) and two curated by open-source investigators – the Twitter account Jomini of the West and Konrad Muzyka’s Ukraine Conflict Monitor – it is apparent that Russian forces are making progress.

Ah so allow me to be clear on what I mean. 

I fully support the Ukrainians fighting for their homeland and for their freedom. 

I do; however, think that Ukraine and NATOs interests are more divergent than we might imagine. Ukraine wants their own sovereignty and freedom (rightly so). NATO is basically committed to fighting Russia to the last Ukrainian. This is logical from NATOs perspective. They get all the benefit (cover for extreme sanctions against Russia, major damage to the Russian military, and a unified Europe upping defence budgets which allows the US to pivot to China ore easily). 

This may sound cynical, but the likely outcome for Ukraine now is that Ukraine does secure some territorial integrity guarantees at the negotiation table (aside from Crimea and the status of the republics are a big question mark right now) and becomes a pro-western state in need of serious aid dollars. The cost/benefit from NATOs perspective is obvious (NATO gets to severely damage Russia without paying too much cost). 

What I am concerned about is NATO underestimating the costs Russia may be able to impose in the future post-Ukraine world. I believe there needs to be a way to re-integrate Russia into the global order.

To be clear, I don't think we will be in a position where all of a sudden Venezuela (as a silly example) suddenly has ICBMs supplied by the Kremlin. What I imagine is a process whereby Russia, now having been, in-effect, ""North Korea-fied"" engages in a series of escalations to get a path off sanctions. 

We're radically changing the Kremlin's risk calculus with these sanctions. I think it seems obvious the goal is degradation of Russia's military capability via sanctions and, hopefully, regime change in the long-run. Putin is increasingly viewing this conflict with the west as existential to his regime (hard not to, given you have US senators calling for his assassination). Leaders facing existential threats tend to systematically downplay the cost of escalation or actions, given the cost of the status quo is so high.

[],False,,chowieuk,,,[],,,,text,t2_b230l,False,False,"&gt;  But the pitfall of ""realism"" is to remove any moral dimension and see all those motivations as morally equivalent

because the morality is literally irrelevant. It doesn't matter what you think is more morally righteous, because each side values their own motivations and considerations independent of the morality.

If morality were part of the equation then this wouldn't be happening at all.

&gt; Yes, in this particular conflict, Russia is absolutely the big bad. Equivocating about that absolute fact makes for bad policy.

No. Saying that 'russia is the big bad and *therefore we have no duty to try and de-escalate because we can just pin the blame on them and take the moral high ground*' leads to bad policy. 

The war is happening. People are dying. Saying 'well if ukrainians die it's putin's fault anyway so it's of no concern to me' is in fact the opposite of moral. 

&gt; The US has its own motivations and considerations, as does Ukraine, as do all the other nations of Europe. And for the majority of them those motivations and considerations include support for the norms of liberal democracy and the rules-based international order that's built on them

A moral justification for the imperialistic enforcement of strategic aims. Note how we don't care about liberal democracy or the rules based international order when it's not strategically in our interest. 

It's really quite interesting how the theoretical basis for 'supporting liberal democracy' leads almost directly to the use of military force to impose our own worldviews on others against their will.... something highly illiberal.... and it can be happily justified as morally righteous.

&gt; That system is morally superior to what Russia wishes to impose, and basing our policy around countering and defeating them is perfectly legitimate.

Exactly. 'Human rights are moral, therefore enforcing human rights is moral, even if it involves killing innumerable people and ignoring their human rights'. It's all circular logic. 'democracy is moral, therefore we are going to tell other people what to think and how they should live their lives, because they are going to have democracy whether they want it or not'. 

This new dressing up of hegemonic control as 'the fight for democracy' makes even less sense than the good old 'fight against communism'. It's always been about control and power and not a whole lot else. Don't forget that the 'rules based international system' is very much a system created by the west in the image WE decided on, run by the west and designed to support our own long term interests... and of course we ignore it when it's not convenient anyway.

I say all this as a fully signed up supporter of liberal democracy, human rights and the rules based international order. I just don't try and pretend the whole thing isn't a bit of a sham. I WISH western countries actually signed up to those things as a point of principle, but i also respect the autonomy of other countries outside my own domestic jurisdiction. 

&gt; It would appear that you think that the US and the West should only conduct their foreign and military policy along strictly pragmatic, amoral lines, while Russia largely gets a pass to pursue Putin's neo-imperialist dream - contrary to the best interests of not only the West but Russia itself - because we're being realist about Russia's ""motivations and considerations.""

I think that we should engage in foreign policy and diplomacy in a way that doesn't lead to preventable invasions leading to mass death. This happened exactly *because* we treated foreign policy as some moral crusade to 'spread democracy', whilst ignoring the realities of the world we live in.

The exact same way that we acted with the iraq invasion that went on to cause untold misery and any number of equally destructive and failed foreign policy endeavours. You would have thought that 80 years on the constantly failed policy of 'overthrowing foreign governments' that has caused so much misery and destruction might have been abandoned, but I guess not.

I'm also curious to know how a non-confrontational relationship between the west and russia is against the interests of both sides? Of course that would involve a situation where NATO needs to justify its existence and the US abandons its hold over europe whilst european countries also give up their free defence contributions.",3c5abd89bda756565a4b6b259e7342d941291867,True,False,,,,,0,1647454332,,0,{},i0wwvba,False,t3_ter2cy,False,True,t1_i0vufec,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ter2cy/the_russian_sanctions_regime_and_the_risk_of/i0wwvba/,1647454344,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647425532.0,

**Crimea:** Ukraine maintains its claim on Crimea but recognizes Russia’s *de facto* administration of the peninsula. Both sides pledge to not attempt changing the *status quo* by force. This will allow Ukraine to keep its territorial integrity legally intact. Crimea will in turn have most international sanctions targeting it (e.g., no usage of Visa and Mastercard) removed and regain access to water from the North Crimean Canal.

**Donbas:** restored to Ukraine but given a high degree of autonomy, including the right for the oblasts to maintain their own military, currency, and language policy. Local elections for the next few years will be monitored and certified by international observers. This should be a win for Ukraine because a united Ukrainian Donbas is likely to become more pro-western in the long term. Plus, post-war Russia will not have the money to rebuild Donbas so the West can work on reorienting its economy towards the rest of Ukraine/Europe.

**Demilitarization/neutrality:** I’m opposed to restrictions on the Ukrainian military because it has so far shown itself to be Ukraine’s best bet against Russian aggression. If Ukraine can trade a pledge of neutrality in return for Russia lifting its demand on arms limitations it should do it. Ukraine has the *potential* to take on Russia alone. If it can modernize its military with western hardware and training, it will not need Nato troops ensure its own safety.

It's no ace in the hole.

Point 4: why would Russia not continue to further these actions even without this war? It's been low cost for the yield. Are you assuming they would stop magically? From their perspective I see no reason to not continue refining such techniques either way.

Point 3: Seems to be a great way to lose China entirely and backfire in the short term that way. Plus risks of backfiring in the mid term. Something like this in hands not controlled by Russia and not necessarily friendly to Beijing seems an unlikely gambit.

Nuclear weapons need a ton of regular maintenance and extreme specialization. While Russia possesses the ability for both of those, it is harder to say exactly what they are capable of this point.

My understanding validates what you’ve said for the most part. Young people in Russia are just as pro-Soviet/authoritarian as much of the older generation, with a sense of “things were better back then.” For sure, there is a substantially more liberalized portion of the population, but with Putin’s rise to power, they’ve tended to be shut out. The internet has surely helped oppose him, but Putin has tremendously high support overall from the population, not just the “boomers.” 

For many younger Russians, the Western style consumer economy is much at fault for the corruption they see, and the corruption is at fault for their inability to be fully engaged in the economy, rather than the government itself. And many of them are only exposed significantly to the *failings* in American democracy and the toxic treatment of portions of our population (as opposed to the positive sides) and feel validated in their concerns with democracy and capitalism. 

So my only disagreement with you is that the Western-style consumer economy, which is being devastated right now, is not necessarily a need so much as a symptom.

1. Cyber (absent from this conflict so far. It's possible that Russia has less capabilities here than we thought).

Indeed, this seems to be a core part of the debate. Military analyses tend to swing like a pendulum. Three weeks ago the consensus was that Russia would destroy Ukraine within 72 hours. Now it's that Russia is going to be pushed back and Crimea liberated. I suspect the truth is somewhere in the middle.

I am not suggesting that Ukraine capitulate. You seem to be of the opinion that the Russian mil is weeks away from a total collapse. *If* that's the case based on your analysis, we can assume that Ukraine, having access to NATO intel, knows this as well. So genuinely, what is to be gained by offering concessions for a ceasefire? Downvote all you like, but this makes zero sense to me. Just hold on for 3 weeks, stall at the negotiating table, and then retake Crimea if it's going to be that easy.

This is... debatable. There was even [an article](https://mwi.usma.edu/russias-logistical-problems-may-slow-down-russias-advance-but-they-are-unlikely-to-stop-it/) posted yesterday on this sub about how Russia's logistics problems are not insurmountable. Numerous experts (Kofman for example) seem to be of the opinion that Russia's logistics problems are not insurmountable per se, but they do increase the cost of the op beyond what Russia may be willing to pay. 

As far as sanctions go, there's no evidence to suggest that sanctions are impacting the military op. These tend to be longer-term affairs. 

&gt;Ukraine has unlimited manpower, belief they're fighting an existential war, and an unlimited budget in aid from the west. 

Putin is also fighting an existential war (or at least, he believes he is, which is what matters). Russia also has significant manpower and materiel not currently deployed to Ukraine. Whether or not he will deploy it depends on the relevant cost / benefit calculation.

I suppose I would flip your question a little. Now that they have failed to quickly win, what are other options for Russian success?  

And that question is predicated on the impact to Putin's regime, so really the question is, 'Now that they have failed to quickly win, what are other options for Putin going forward that allows him to survive politically?'.

Can he afford to retreat?  Must he force a capitulation of the Ukrainian govt?  Will a negotiated settlement allow him to survive politically?

""There are, however, some notable downsides to delayed demands when it comes to creating credible off-ramps out of the conflict. The lack of clear demands might fuel a belief that Putin already seems to hold — the notion that the West is determined to undermine and weaken Russia. The image of punitive measures targeting Russia with no end in sight could be used to further galvanize Putin’s domestic propaganda. In this environment, Putin himself, his top leadership, and the broader Russian public may become increasingly unlikely to believe any Western off-ramp offers made down the road. The lack of public demands also erodes the credibility of any promises attached to private discussions. It is easier for leaders to disavow pledges made away from public scrutiny.

A few things to consider though:

1. Militaries can commandeer civilian vehicles if need be. Doing that in itself wouldn't automatically constitute perfidy. You might be correct that they have an obligation to reasonably mark their vehicles but I don't know what that would look like. Or perhaps it is enough that they wear insignia on their persons.

2. How far back in the supply lines are we talking about? Is it distribution to frontline units or the cars driving across the Polish border to Ukrainian logistics bases. Military supply lines go all the way back to people packing ammo in boxes at the ammo factory. As such all countries tend to use progressively more civilians and civilian equipment the further back in the supply lines you go. Weapon shipment and other military support functions can be legal military targets but it it doesn't mean they can't be undertaken by civilians.

3. Russia marks their vehicles with the Z to avoid having them shot up by friendly fire.

That said, so much of all of this depends on our understanding of Russian power structures, which is very limited. The idea that this is purely Putin's blunder - and that therefore there are competing powers within Russia that could punish him for it - seems unlikely. This whole operation appears to have had buy in from most of the major stakeholders in the Russian government (sans oligarchs perhaps, but who knows what means they have of ousting Putin). There is this assumption that this is a big enough failure that the existing regime must show some kind of token victory or it's finished, but there's no real evidence of that. It seems the Russian people largely don't know or care about the details of the invasion, there isn't exactly mass protests happening. So where does the blow that fells Putin come from? The military? From what I'm seeing they're largely politically neutered. Security services? They seem too paranoid and fractured to manage a concerted coup effort.

The lack of a bloc which is more Soviet mentality oriented may make these younger generations less tolerant of authoritarianism but they may also still remain tolerant enough as long as the Western-style consumer economy, travel and decent levels of internet access exist.

There's also the question as to whether Soviet mentality thinking is durable beyond those who merely lived in it.  Some of these attitudes I think are culturally epigenetic, especially in rural populations and the blue collar, probably much in the way that overt racism in the US remains culturally stubborn despite much of the overt racist generations dying off.  Obviously this is a metaphor with some limits, but there's a lot of folks in the US in their 30s with pretty toxic racial ideas, despite being born decades after MLK's assassination and mostly exposed to educational and cultural messaging denigrating racism.

I'm not a huge fan of broad, sweeping cultural generalizations about Russians or anyone else, but I'm having difficulty fighting the notion that Russian culture is pretty ingrained in an acceptance of authoritarianism and generational change is extremely slow at shifting some of these attitudes.

Overall, I think you've got a good point.   Russia has a significant political problem.   Their overall military/political strategy in the war appears to have been premised on faulty intelligence.   

They envisioned some degree of strategic suprise,  being able to rapidly take Ukrainian centers of political power and either force the official ukrainian government to capitulate, or to be able to substitute their own political authority for the official one in Ukraine, and Putin was gambling that if they could accomplish that in two weeks or less, the west would not be interested in the mutual risk of protracted economic sanctions and accept the fait accompli. 

Now, even if Russia ""Wins"" on the battlefield, and there's some question as to what that looks like,  Russia will almost universially be perceived as an occupying power, any any Ukranian authority under the Russians as a puppet, and the west is unlikely to accept it. 

I don't think there is a solution to that problem. Either the west ends up ""forgetting"" and letting the status quo return to normal, or they don't. Russia can't do a whole lot to change the outcome.",d966166aa0fde573d681b72eb6140ea59772338f,True,False,,,,,0,1647442489,,0,{},i0w3jyk,False,t3_tew3c3,False,True,t1_i0ug9bq,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tew3c3/russias_logistical_problems_may_slow_down_russias/i0w3jyk/,1647442500,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647413689.0,

Do even they know how bad it is in Ukraine or is this being kept to such a need to know basis that they're having to synthesize Western media and abstract knowledge and getting a less than complete picture that could drive action?

I'm not even sure how much back channel the CIA has to the highly compartmentalized and secretive intelligence groups operating at the fringes of Putin's direct control.

Can 152mm howitzers/field guns in the vicinity be used against those ships or the landing force? I mean apart from perfectly setup shore guns with better aim and longer range there should be a couples of regular 152 and other artillery in the vicinity to defend the city or not?

2. Armed civilians are explicitly protected under the Geneva convention III and can lawfully participate in hostilities in certain situations.

&gt; Why even bother engaging in this sort of discussion if you are just going to dismiss the other side as 'the big bad' and refuse to even acknowledge that they have their own motivations and considerations?

Of course they have their own motivations and considerations. But the pitfall of ""realism"" is to remove any moral dimension and see all those motivations as morally equivalent. Yes, in this particular conflict, *Russia is absolutely the big bad.* Equivocating about that absolute fact makes for bad policy. 

The US has its own motivations and considerations, as does Ukraine, as do all the other nations of Europe. And for the majority of them those motivations and considerations include support for the norms of liberal democracy and the rules-based international order that's built on them. That system is *morally superior* to what Russia wishes to impose, and basing our policy around countering and defeating them is perfectly legitimate.

It would appear that you think that the US and the West should only conduct their foreign and military policy along strictly pragmatic, amoral lines, while Russia largely gets a pass to pursue Putin's neo-imperialist dream - contrary to the best interests of not only the West but Russia itself - because we're being realist about Russia's ""motivations and considerations."" The West has motivations and considerations too, and it turns out that we still have way more leverage to impose them than Putin does.

When it was first proposed and the implication was that they could be flying and shifting the balance of power within a couple of days, I was very hopeful.

But there are genuine difficulties involved - everything is in Polish and a bunch of their subsystems aren't the ones Ukraine has been operating until now. Russian air defenses are having mixed success with small drones, but large soviet era jets will probably be another story.

&gt; Russian APS is untested, but your general statement about APS tending to kill your own dismounted troops is incorrect.

Russian APS is just a continuation of Soviet APS which has been used in combat and does exactly that - it killed a shitload of their own troops to the point that it was typically turned off until the last possible moment, which makes it not at all ideal for defending against an ambush. Maybe it's way better - but based on what I've seen so far and Russia's complete failure to do any kind of meaningful SEAD or electronic warfare, I suspect Armata's APS probably sucks. 

&gt;Which matters for frontal penetration by ATGMs.

Sure, but most of these vehicles aren't being engaged from the front, and given that weapons like Skif have something like 1400mm of penetration even a frontal hit is extremely dicey for the crew, as that is (on paper) way more than enough to penetrate as far as the crew compartment protection. 

I might be coming off as combative (I don't mean to be) but if the best we can do is that second and third rate anti-tank munitions like LAWs and Recoilless rifles aren't able to penetrate the frontal armor of the newest MBTs, then I think we can safely say that the days of the main battle tank are limited. I just don't see how it's viable for them to operate in an environment in which a 7Kg weapon that costs 2% of the price of the vehicle can engage and destroy them from &gt;2km away.

One aspect of the war that isn't talked about in media very much is Ukraine's blatant disregard for the rules of war. Which isn't to say it's a bad thing, because fighting dirty is (sometimes) fighting smart. But it should be acknowledged by people doing higher-level analysis than the Zelenskyy show.

Ukraine had generally enlisted the entire population in the war. They handed out weapons to civilians and encouraged them to use them on their own. When they don't have guns they encourage people to make their own petrol bombs. They encourage civilians to protest and sabotage behind enemy lines. The UA has been transporting ammo/weapons in civilians cars, which is why Russia has been attacking civilian cars on the road. This of course gets spun as propaganda by Ukraine. 

Ukraine is already fighting some kind of modern hybrid guerilla war. They're using the same tactics employed by insurgent fighters across the world. Blending into the civilian population not only provides cover, it forces the occupiers to attack civilians as well, only furthering resistance. It can be argued that Ukrainian government is placing civilians in harms way and successfully pinning it on Russia. However, it seems like most Ukranians support this style of war even if it places them at greater risk.

All of this is a lot of words to say that I don't think Ukraine or Ukrianians really care about becoming nonprotected combatants.

I suspect there's something of trying to prove to the West that regardless of how screwed up this campaign is from a military perspective, Russia cannot be stopped and will wreck Ukraine anyway.

I kind of have been waiting for some kind of think/analyst piece trying to convince the security services to depose Putin and quit the war.

The other part of the pitch that wouldn't appear in a think/analyst piece is that for the authoritarians in the security services who really don't want any kind of return to democracy is that if they depose Putin in the name of reforms, those reforms of course can be paper-thin and short term, and within a decade they can be back on the path to another authoritarian regime.",46822b80797cac917b1b8539cee4b439f8d139fc,True,False,,,,,0,1647435081,,0,{},i0vn3b1,False,t3_tf0j9d,False,True,t1_i0suo1s,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tf0j9d/russia_facing_outright_defeat_and_sudden_collapse/i0vn3b1/,1647435096,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647406281.0,

In the coming days, think the following is going to be important:  the Ukrainians have (‘silently’) launched a mobilisation of their ‘1st echelon of reserves’ already on Friday, 18 February. Means, by 24th, these were already in place. From memory, on that day (or, was it a day later?), Zelensky then ordered a general mobilisation, recalling the ‘2nd echelon of reserves’, too. The latest research by Adrien Fontanellaz (between others, he read himself through a 2,000-pages of a related report from 2021), this might have brought their forces to about 300,000 troops, if not more. This in turn is what drove me to the conclusion: the Russians with their troop-strength meanwhile down to less than 190,000, can’t win this war. The minimal requirement for an operation of this size and scope would have been about 250,000 – just to conquer Ukraine: holding it under control would require about 500,000 - which they are never going to reach. Thus, troops-wise, they are outmatched. 

While Ukrainians are outmatched by the Russian air power and artillery, NATO’s deliveries of advanced infantry armament, and intel-support, are adding plenty of situational awareness to Ukrainian commanders, and plentiful firepower even to ‘light’ Ukrainian reservist units (see: infantry) – the mass of which has combat experience from Donbass of the last eight years. In comparison, the mass of RFA units was never ‘blooded’ before this invasion (that appears to have been a crucial reason for their massive losses, early on). Finally, the Ukrainians have the advantage of the inner line: as we’ve seen in the last few days, whenever there’s another Russian penetration of the frontlines, they usually need about 12-24 hours to bring in enough reinforcements to contain. Meanwhile, it seems they’re capable of doing this even in the south-east (not sure about the south, yet).

That inability to stop the initial advance however is not (in my opinion) what is going to happen again once ""Russia tries again"" to advance these 100 miles as the article proposes.

1. Russia can and will win the war conventionally, if it really wants.
2. They win geostrategically, if they can get the Ukraine with minor losses. This seems to be not the case.
3. With substantial losses, Russias demographic situation gets even worse AND the conquered, hostile Ukrainians are a liability.
4. The sanctions are for us inconvenient, but not a long-term problem (green energy and Europe has actually more coal and gas then people think. They just do not ""harvest"" it currently 'cause of green energy doctrine - and it takes time to shift the energy-mix). Short-term, they are, of course (no energy = no industry = unemployed people = social unrest).

The U.S. oil embargo in 1941 was not connected to the Japanese war in China, which the article outright falsely states; it was entirely connected to the Japanese occupation of French Indochina (i.e. Vietnam). The U.S. embargo regime was not connected to withdrawal from China, which most understood as untenable, but to withdrawal from Indochina, which had little value to the Japanese except as a springing point for the South Strike offensive. In addition, the main decision makers for war, the IJA and IJN, had little vulnerability to most civilian pressure, having overthrown civilian governorship.

In the example of First World War Germany, I don't even see the article attempting ANY connection between sanctions/economic warfare on Germany and German decision making. That said, one of the links in the article does go to a TNSR article that does, but this too is off; the argument is that German elites were unable to accept Wilson's peace due to the blockade, but Chancellor Hollweg was representative of the banking class and did not object to the peace.  Instead, the problem was that he had been entirely sidelined by the military, particularly by Ludendorff, who became the prime mover for policy. Ludendorff's decision making has been well explored, and seems entirely motivated as a gamble for victory. I have found no link anywhere in this article or any other that shows a connection between the British blockade and unrestricted submarine warfare IN HIS BRAIN PARTICULARLY.

Overall, in both these historical examples, the decision making was done near solely by real military men. I do not believe Putin or anyone in the Kremlin is actually really a military man, even if Shoigu occasionally larps as one.

'seeing the consequences'.

You're getting there slowly but surely. By 'seeing the consequences' what you mean is that they cannot act against the strategic interests of the great powers, because they don't actually have the same level of autonomy and agency that a sovereign state should in theory have. FWIW the middle east, Europe, east asian archipelago  and the ENTIRE americas is the US 'sphere of influence' in which they won't let anyone do anything they don't like. See the monroe and carter doctrines. Pakistan could develop nukes because well they weren't in anyone's sphere of influence.... but iran ran afoul of the US, despite being 7000 miles away.

What you're struggling with is that you agree with one and not the other. Because you can't look at it from a point of principle.

&gt; If you want to talk amoral geopolitics, Russia actually has to have enough power and leverage to have a ""sphere of influence"" and client states with enough incentive to keep countries like Ukraine in their orbit. 

The incentive is that if you don't play along with your large, paranoid neighbour, things will go badly for you. Russia just crushed an uprising in kazakhstan with ease because of the exact same reasons they are invading ukraine.

&gt; Throwing a hissy fit because they don't have the same kind of power as the USSR is just sad.

Eh? That's... not what's happening.

Why do you think Russia seized crimea almost immediately after a west aligned coup in ukraine? Because it is a key strategic objective in their national defence. Not because it's a nice holiday resort.

&gt; Ukraine sees it in their interests to align with the west, and have zero obligation to cede those interests to Russia, even under the threat of force.

Fantastic. I wish i could live in your world where diplomacy is somehow irrelevant to diplomacy. And again, you are being a complete hypocrite. Presumably you defend cuba in the same way? Cuba that is still being destroyed and impoverished by the US 60 years later for having the audacity to want to 'align with the east'.

eh? Your argument is that the economic sanctions are going to force them into conceding. They're not.

Most likely in the form of attacks becoming increasingly indiscriminate and civilians (in russia AND ukraine) suffering the consequences.

The only thing that will end this war is something putin can sell as a victory or putin being ousted from power. The latter is extremely unlikely.

&gt; Russia has already tried that, they called these sanctions 'acts of war', nobody took them seriously, and the sanctions keep on pilling up

You're making the same mistake as everyone else and taking public rhetoric to hold any meaningful value. Putin spouting shite about 'nazis' does not mean he's fighting nazis, it's just bullshit public statements for public consumption. 

The threat to use nukes was a direct response to the suggestion that NATO could become more involved in the war. It's the obvious 'btfo' play. If this war actually drags on and things become existential for russia/ putin.... then yes WMDs are very much on the table.

&gt; Russia can either continue down North Korea's path, where the nukes are enough to stop an invasion but not enough to lift sanction, or they can make the concessions needed to re-enter the global economy.

You're still making moral arguments rather than rational, pragmatic arguments.

I don't know how actionable intel gets from US recon assets to Ukrainian ground commanders, but I'm sure most of that path is either by wired communications, which can't be jammed at all, or by wireless communications that can't be effectively jammed because of the transmitter's power, the distance from Russian positions to the receiver, and electronic protect/ECCM capabilities.

Interfering with wired networks would be more within the cyber-warfare realm. Or the kinetic warfare realm. 

The only links in that communications chain that could reasonably be jammed would be radio communications near the line of contact. There probably is some EW activity going on at that level.

The 'Western Coalition' has several goals:

* Make Russia cease the current hostilities'
* Make Russia withdraw to pre-conflict lines
* Prevent Russia from attempting any further adventurism for the foreseeable future

The hostilities will eventually cease when Russia runs out of money, men, or willpower. They are already running out of foreign reserves, and soon will have to start printing rubles, which will probably lead to hyperinflation in months. They are taking casualties at around 1,000 a day. This comes at great cost to Ukraine, but it is absolutely unsustainable for Russia. You can't hide that number of bodies for ever. People in Russia are going to ask where their children are. And while domestic sentiment for the war is still positive in Russia, as the sanctions bite, people lose jobs, the Ruble plunges, inflation kicks in, and the bodies pile up, that sentiment will shift.

Unfortunately, it's very hard to see an 'Off Ramp' for Putin. Anything less than a victory will almost certainly end his regime, so he will need something he can sell in Moscow to justify the destruction of the economy, the effective destruction of Russia's military, and tens of thousands of casualties (so far.) It's very hard to see a path to withdrawal from Ukraine that doesn't involve deposing Putin.

Russia's military is no longer a credible fighting force, but the Western Coalition is going to want guarantees about rearmament to remove the possibility of Russia doing something stupid in the Baltics in the future.

Simply, there is no clear route for the current Russian regime to take the steps that the Western coalition will need to ease sanctions.

In the medium term, Putin will die or be deposed, and the kleptarchy will move to install someone who is at least somewhat palatable to the Western Coalition. Then we will see a gradual process to reintegrate Russia into the world.

The Wild Card is China. They can see a route to gaining significant long-tern influence in Russia, giving them access to the vast natural resources there. By keeping the screws on, the Western Coalition risks Russia turning Eastwards and becoming, in effect, a vassal of Beijing. That is the one thing that might change the picture.

If Putin were replaced with someone who makes peaceful noises to the West, and affirms Russia's historical role in Europe, then there may be more rapid progress to rapprochement.

But right now, with Putin's army murdering civilians across Ukraine, there is no obvious path to easing sanctions - quite the reverse.",e98a2fb97f229f3193b935a10c688b69f804d256,True,False,,,,,0,1647404665,,0,{},i0ugxhu,False,t3_tebcpr,False,True,t3_tebcpr,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tebcpr/sanctions_after_a_ukrainerussia_ceasefire/i0ugxhu/,1647404678,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647375865.0,

Which may not be true. [Here's an article that debunks it (in Russian)](https://fsb.dossier.center/beseda) Relevant part: 
  

&gt;The Center ""Dosye"" talked to several sources close to different units of the FSB to find out what really happened to Beseda and Bolyukh. Three sources confirmed that General Beseda was indeed brought to the investigation department of the FSB, but there was no criminal case against him and the head of the ""Five"" continued to be at large. Sources said that the officers of the Department of Internal Security waited until the head of the ""Five"" arrived at work and asked him to go to the FSB office. One of the Dosie's sources supposes that this was done intentionally: there have been increasing numbers of leaks from the FSB recently. ""The FSB has staged a show of detaining Beseda, in order to see who leaks information about this case and where they will go,"" he says.

&gt;Anatoli Bolyukh was also questioned by the FSB, after which he was released. He has not headed the department of operational information for a long time now: his transfer to Rosgeologiya was a demotion for him, and he would not be able to return to his previous position in the security service. Most likely, the investigators were interested in the period before 2015, when Bolyukh was still the head of DPI.

&gt;The arrest of Beseda and Bolyukh is not only not confirmed by our sources, but also does not fit into the general logic of the Russian authorities. High-ranking officials of the FSB, unlike officers of the Investigative Committee or the Interior Ministry, are very rarely involved in criminal cases, even if they are directly linked to crimes. One can recall the example of Interior Ministry Colonel Dmitry Zakharchenko - the case against him was widely covered in the state media, but his associates from the M Department of the FSB were able to quietly resign and avoid criminal prosecution. Moreover, it is difficult to believe that such high-profile investigations could have begun right in the midst of a war in which the 5th service of the FSB plays a key role: traditionally, officials and law enforcement officers who have been guilty are punished in a deferred manner, months or even years after their transgressions.

The author frames things in terms of *fait accompli* strategies against NATO in this piece, and it’s interesting that this same framing is absent from the article in the main post, despite a few key similarities between the scenarios. 

If Russian logistics weren’t really capable of supporting a rapid offensive deeper than a few dozen miles into foreign territory, why would Russia risk that approach rather than drawing out Ukrainian forces to do most of the heavy fighting closer to Russian supply depots? The answer seems to be that a fait accompli was seen by Russian planners as essential to obviating the challenges of a more protracted conflict (I.e. consolidated Ukrainian resistance backed by a unified NATO supplying weapons and levying punishing sanctions).

Therefore, even if we accept the author’s premise that Russia will eventually overcome its logistical challenges enough to effectively press onward in a narrow military sense, how much does that really matter for them in the total strategic, economic, and political context of the war if so much of the premise of Russian success in this context seemed predicated on being able to win quickly?",328f3ea5dd348d4e285d9eed8f9fad1f59b1a080,True,False,,,,,0,1647404291,,0,{},i0ug9bq,False,t3_tew3c3,False,True,t1_i0s5nan,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tew3c3/russias_logistical_problems_may_slow_down_russias/i0ug9bq/,1647404303,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647375491.0,

This always gets mentioned, but during its history, what is the longest period that the United States has not been involved in a major military conflict? The reality is that America has been a bellicose country, and regardless of the claims that its populace has become war weary, that's simply not born out by its history. The longest the US has gone without being involved in a large conflict was the 30 years between the War of 1812 and the Mexican-American War. The notion that Americans will suddenly be too war-weary to act in defense of a sovereign democracy invaded by an authoritarian regime just isn't backed by our history and willingness to go to war.

What has surprised me is that we haven't seen more full-on ""guerrilla"" tactics (there's a more accurate name for that). I mean sabotage, IEDs, and truly outside-the-box unconventional tactics. In particular, I am surprised that they didn't physically prepare the terrain ahead of the invasion more extensively, both with improvised and traditional denial devices. 

We see images of Ukrainian civilians heroically welding tank traps, but not robust anti-tank and anti-personnel mines. Russians have been able to gain a significant advantage in the south by using rail lines to move up materiel and yet blowing up railroad tracks has been pretty much the iconic resistance move since WWII. Ukraine successfully scuttled at least one of its naval ships to prevent its capture but I assumed they would also either preemptively destroy, or heavily heavily booby trap their ports, however Russian forces have been able to seize and use them. We've seen intense fighting in urban centers, but as far as I know, little use of booby traps, IEDs, or even the molotov cocktails we've heard so much about. 

Any idea why not? Javelins are expensive. ANFO and dynamite and rigged hand grenades are cheap. Why haven't we seen parked minivans stuffed with explosives go off as Russian convoys drive past? Or buried artillery shells with garage door openers lining the approaches to towns? Molotov cocktails tossed out of windows? Even just more use of snipers. Basically, the bog-standard 21st Century asymmetric war playbook. 

I absolutely recognize that it is silly and presumptuous of me to ask these questions sitting in absolute safety thousands of miles away. I am just curious. Given everything we witnessed in Iraq and Afghanistan, it seems like a bunch of tactics that I expected to see from day one haven't materialized.

If you're referencing the period 1991 to today, there's no real way that's true.  When Yeltsin left, the country was ripe for a quasi-Soviet strong man.  The Russian military was in complete disarray with many assets unable to operate do to parts, crew, resources, etc.  The economy was weak because the export infrastructure had not been strongly established to sell resources.  GDP per capita PPP has increased about 5.7x from 2000 to 2020 under Putin (and incidentally, about 5.8x in Ukraine under various shades of leadership).  Now you're right that Russian GDP peaked in ~2013 and has been declining.  One could argue that the actions Putin undertook in 2014 were perhaps trying to distract from the fact that the Russian economy is intrinsically tied to demand in both Asia and the EU.  China's GDP per capita PPP grew almost 11x in that same period, such that it was below both Russia and Ukraine in 2000 and is now just above Russia and well-above Ukraine as of 2020.  

Russia has/is/or was trying to position itself as a resource provider, perhaps a regional influencer, but somehow legacy and ambition got in the way and someone decided that the glory of the Soviet days could be reclaimed with a little blood.  Instead they've completely fuct the idea of buying resources for them.  Nord Stream 2 will never run now and alternatives to Russian resources are already being bid up and preferred even by private companies who are not compelled to avoid Russian buying.  

I understand Russia is planning on nationalizing all of the passenger jets that are still within its territory but are owned by leasing companies; someone called that about $50B in assets.  Call me crazy, but countries that nationalize stuff don't get a lot of repeat business.  Venezuela is trying to incentivize E&amp;P to come back but once bitten twice shy.

Russia *could* have seen a path that was sort of a 'soft landing' as a commodity export country.  That would have involved swallowing some national pride and sizing down government spending, increasing social programs, etc.  He could have called it ""the Russian version of the EU"".  Sure, no legitimate democracy, but that hasn't generally been a Russian historical concern.

Yeah, given what happened now though, they are only getting weaker.  Still reparations don't make sense.  If they've ruined their own economy and no one wants to really do much business with them, how will they ever pay the massive bill they'll be saddled with?  They will always be able to point to that massive debt as something the 'West' put on Russia to 'enslave' it.  

There's a really big reason we didn't do reparations after WW2.
