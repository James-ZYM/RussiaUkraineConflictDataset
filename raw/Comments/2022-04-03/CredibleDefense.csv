I actually *do* agree with you but we were also skeptical that the Chinese would do it the first time it happened:

&gt; ""What,"" asked Harry Truman, ""are the chances for Chinese or Soviet intervention?"". Sonorously, MacArthur replied, ""Very little."" He went on to say that had they interfered during the first or second months it would have been decisive. ""But we are no longer fearful of their intervention. We no longer stand with hat in hand."" He mentioned that the Chinese had 300,000 men in Manchuria, of which not more than 200,000 were along the Yalu River. Of these, **not more than 60,000 could be got across**. ""The Chinese have no air force. **If the Chinese try to get down to P'yongyang there will be the greatest slaughter.""** No one, civilian or military, disagreed with MacArthur's view.

and for that matter, the attack on Pearl Harbour was pretty unthinkable too:

* “Only hysteria entertains the idea that . . . Japan contemplates war upon us.” 

- John Foster Dulles, US diplomat and later Secretary of State, 1941

* “The Hawaiian Islands are over-protected; the entire Japanese fleet and Air Force could not seriously threaten Oahu.” 

- Capt. William T. Pulleston, former Chief of US Naval Intelligence, 1941.

and over-confidence about American military capabilities is also something of which we ought to be wary:

* “It is significant that despite claims of air enthusiasts, no battleship has yet been sunk by bombs.” Caption to photo of USS Arizona in program for Army-Navy football game, November 29, 1941. (Eight days later, the Arizona went to the bottom at Pearl Harbor after taking a direct bomb hit.)

* “The modern German theory of victory by blitzkrieg [lightning war] is untried and, in the opinion of many experts, unsound.” Time Magazine, 1939.

They don't require superior range to do their missions, assuming they can stay mobile and evade counter battery fire.. 

While true, being in a position where your guns can be counter batteried by theirs, while you cannot, is an extremely poor situation that renders your guns at their mercy. Effectively this means that the Army's existing 39-cal guns have to constantly relocate to avoid counter battery fire...and the majority of US tube artillery are towed M777 and M119 systems. While an adversary would have to contend with the range of GMLRS, which is *very good* even today, their often longer ranged, faster firing, more mobile systems are much less vulnerable.

&gt;Short range organic mortars and smaller guns can provide responsive support very well, you don't need massive guns for that.

In infantry fights, mortars are extremely useful. They however lose their utility massively in large armored fights simply due to short range and lesser effects on target.

That is an extreme example, but it shows that artillery is still immensely useful in many circumstances. Most of GWOT prevented artillery from being useful just due to the huge distances involved compared to artillery, but when used it was devastating. And the Ukrainian Civil War has been an eight year exhibition on the power of well employed artillery.

&gt; The paragraph immediately preceding discusses Kosovo, where, AFAIK no artillery was deployed by NATO.

Kosovo is relevant because it showed that even ""weak"" but well operated air defenses can severely disrupt the ability of air power to effect operations on the ground. This wasn't as critical then, since NATO's land commitment was extremely limited.

The war in Ukraine has prompted several countries to send weapons to Volodymyr Zelenskyy's government to help it defend itself against Russian aggression. For Ukraine, a prompt and plentiful supply of arms may be essential to its democratic survival. But the global arms trade is a hugely complicated – and controversial business.
In this edition of Business Beyond, we will look at how the global arms trade functions and ask why this multi-billion dollar business is unlike any other. We will also consider the question: how much of the global export of deadly weapons and sales is about profit, rather than security.

The price is what makes me wonder, it's just so incredibly expensive to have even one 5/6 gen fighter, so the capabilities need to provide exceedingly costly to counter benefit to be worth it.

I guess it's a question of timing, but, the gradual trend is towards smaller size weapon systems that maintain lethality over the past 100 years. Smaller means harder to target, less materiel to blow up if you do. It also means cheaper.

In a sense, standoff missiles are exactly that. But what is the difference between a standoff range missile that can be given new targets en route, a loitering munition, and a drone? 

I think that distinction gets blurred and eventually we ditch the very expensive launcher.

Not military, but I'm very familiar with a signals and systems topics and AI generally, and understand how most of the current countermeasures you are referring to work.

Assumption 1: It will continue to be possible to interfere with comms in an environment with a ton of drones, which can of course do point to point comms and form a large peer to peer network. Disrupting a small drone operations makes sense. What if a normal drone force is several hundred or thousand tiny drones with some larger drones? In such a case, which does not seem that far out, that seems speculative to be able to interfere. It is far, far harder to jam a highly redundant peer network of that type. 

Assumption 2: If you do interfere with comms, it will make a large difference on drone effectiveness.. meaning.. that it wont be possible to have moderate or high autonomy drones that continue to effectively carry out intelligent intent when not commanded. But, might be mooted by the first. This goes to the question of what's the level of human control required? I know no one wants lethal instruments to target for themselves... but it's probably coming, and it's just steps off of the current state of fire and forget missiles. What if you gave an order 5 minutes before? Is that close enough for people to be OK with it?

The Ukrainian general mobilisation has produced units of varying degrees of usefulness. The territorial defence, as the name implies, is not mobile and will defend only their townships.

More importantly, the mobilisation seems to have failed in large parts of the country. It is quite noticeable that no local reservists and no territorial defence made any appearance in the entire southern Ukraine. In dozens of videos from Mariupol you can only see Azov volunteers and Ukraine regulars.

Russia will never mobilise the same percentage of the population, but it doesn't have to. Mobilising enough troops to match the Ukranians 1:1 is likely to be sufficient, considering the enormous advantage in heavy weapons, air force and missile forces.

It's only not news because we started talking about it more than six years ago when work started on a new* 58-cal barrel for the M777 and M109. That same year we awarded development for an ATACMS replacement to extend Army rocket artillery range out to the INF maximum. Now that INF is kill, they plan to go much further to between 700-800km with the Increment 3 PrSM (nee LRPF) missile, as well as extended range GMLRS  land-based Tomahawk and SM-6 (the latter for both offensive and defensive missions).

\* Well, not really new, that barrel and mount were first developed in the 80s.

&gt;it's barely even relevant in US military strategy.

It's highly relevant because we know that in many realistic scenarios we know that the Army cannot assume that the Air Force  and Navy will be capable of providing responsive, effective CAS against an opponent with even moderately capable air defenses. It doesn't have to be China or Russia using the latest air defenses either. Kosovo showed that even outdated SAM systems operated smartly can greatly hinder the ability of air assets to perform effectively. Thus ground forces require their own fire support assets.

Additionally, artillery can be vastly more responsive than CAS, landing rounds on target in under three to five minutes depending on availability, compared to CAS which can take tens of minutes to respond, communicate with ground forces, and engage, while having lower ability to sustain than a single artillery battery.

Additionally, one of the objectives of the Army's LRPF effort (which encompasses all efforts to improve Army tube and rocket artillery) is to engage components of an adversary IADS in conjunction with Air Force and Navy aircraft, which can then better enable them to perform their other mission sets of interdiction, strike, counter-air, and CAS.

To a degree, but mobilization takes time, and until now many of those men and women were deployed around various other points in Ukraine, including Odessa and Lviv that are no longer in serious danger of capture. That frees up those personnel for the Donbass front. Ukraine, just like Russia, takes time to mobilize. And with the breathing space they've gained after the northern front closed down, they have time to train, reorganize, and prepare more Territorial Defense units and bring in new recruits - same as the Russians.

&gt; Are you really assuming that Ukraine of 44 million can mobilise the same amount of troops as Russia of 150 million? Their mobilisation capacity is not equal.

Their mobilization capacity is not equal, of course not. But Russia is never going to mobilize an equivalent proportion of their population to subdue Ukraine, not without sacrificing every other single geopolitical objective they have, not unless they want to burn their military to cinders in the process. The second attack is not likely to be more successful than the first; everything that hurt Russia the first time around will be even worse.

Quotes from the article:

&gt; * Whether it’s Taiwan or any other potential conflict, the scenario is rarely the focus of the war games we at CNA design for the U.S. Defense Department. Instead, war games are about better understanding how the U.S. military can build deterrence, what technology gaps could hobble its forces, how an adversary’s capabilities might evolve in response to U.S. capabilities, and how all that might impact what Washington should invest in today. Fundamentally, war games strive to explore and distill the fundamental nature of the problem itself—which rarely leads to definitive scenarios or solutions.

&gt; * The real takeaways aren’t so much about victory or defeat in a particular conflict but about what’s exposed along the way. Why did deterrence fail in the scenario? Which of the adversary’s capabilities limited the United States’ ability to project force? Fine-grained analysis of questions like these drives progress in the U.S. military and allows it to increase its tactical, operational, and strategic proficiency.

Cyberattacks plunge the island into darkness, confusion, and fear. A rain of missiles overwhelms Taiwanese defenses, destroying military bases and communications infrastructure. At sea, the Chinese navy surrounds the country as hundreds of landing craft speed across the Taiwan Strait. As U.S. warships close in, they are overwhelmed by missiles, torpedoes, and drones. Videos of the Chinese blitz and sinking U.S. ships flood the internet. The demoralized Taiwanese decline to raise arms against the Chinese forces storming their shores.

This is the kind of narrative most people imagine when they think of military war games—scenes in the bowels of the Pentagon, units fighting digitally on electronic maps, commanders pondering their next step in a fast-moving crisis. Victory in the simulation, so the popular imagination goes, shows how to win a real-life conflict. Defeat in a war game, on the other hand, is an acknowledgement that any actual conflict will likely be lost.

Contrary to the popular imagination, however, this is not how war games work. Rarely is a war game designed to predict the future or develop a single definitive strategy. Instead, a war game helps military planners and analysts explore and understand a complex problem, regardless of the outcome. Win or lose, the purpose isn’t to define a strategy for the U.S. military but to help it better understand the capabilities it has, what it can already do, and what it needs.

Whether it’s Taiwan or any other potential conflict, the scenario is rarely the focus of the war games we at CNA design for the U.S. Defense Department. Instead, war games are about better understanding how the U.S. military can build deterrence, what technology gaps could hobble its forces, how an adversary’s capabilities might evolve in response to U.S. capabilities, and how all that might impact what Washington should invest in today. Fundamentally, war games strive to explore and distill the fundamental nature of the problem itself—which rarely leads to definitive scenarios or solutions.

In fact, using war games to craft a clear-cut strategy is impossible. Done right, war games are a plausible method of providing a brief and limited glimpse into a possible future—a single future in a multiverse of possibilities. Trying to imitate victory in a war game, on the other hand, means trying to align both sides’ future decisions in a complex conflict with the scenario that played out during the game. Obviously, these decisions are numerous and mostly beyond one’s control.

When military leaders are unwilling to accept failure, they drive the entire Defense Department toward stagnation and safe bets.

Trying to avoid the failures identified in a war game presents a much richer avenue to explore. Did the U.S. side fail because of logistics shortfalls? Was its demise due to a missing capability—or an incorrect assumption about the adversary? War games can be designed to focus on just a single aspect of a conflict, such as the U.S. Navy’s deployment at the start of a Chinese attack on Taiwan, and to stress that aspect to the breaking point. Finding the conditions under which the U.S. side fails is invaluable, because it creates an opportunity to address a weakness. Success, on the other hand, makes it very hard to know where to invest and even harder to convince anyone the investment is worth making. Failure identifies the critical pieces that need attention, and the war game narrative highlights the cost of neglect. Through multiple iterations, a war game can steadily offer clarity on the way forward.

In 2030, Beijing reaches a deadly decision: reunification with Taiwan at any cost. Cyberattacks plunge the island into darkness, confusion, and fear. A rain of missiles overwhelms Taiwanese defenses, destroying military bases and communications infrastructure. At sea, the Chinese navy surrounds the country as hundreds of landing craft speed across the Taiwan Strait. U.S. warships provide critical missile defense to threatened U.S. regional bases. Long-range bombers and guided missiles decimate the landing craft approaching Taiwan, giving the country a brief window to rally its defenses and gather strength against the remaining Chinese troops who reached their shores.

For a war game to be useful, it’s largely irrelevant which potential conflict is played out. The game might use a Chinese invasion of Taiwan as the backdrop—but only as a use case for the military forces being examined. The real takeaways aren’t so much about victory or defeat in a particular conflict but about what’s exposed along the way. Why did deterrence fail in the scenario? Which of the adversary’s capabilities limited the United States’ ability to project force? Fine-grained analysis of questions like these drives progress in the U.S. military and allows it to increase its tactical, operational, and strategic proficiency. It forces hard examinations of information sharing, command and control, processes and procedures, and even organizational structures. None of these things is really about a Taiwan conflict. But if the United States did go to war—over Taiwan, a Baltic state, or any other country—the answers to these questions would help it succeed.

In the words of U.S. Air Force Gen. John Hyten, the U.S. side “failed miserably” during a 2020 war game that reportedly involved a Chinese assault on Taiwan. (The exact scenario remains classified.) But that result wasn’t the disaster it was made out to be by the press. Failure in a war game is a common feature, not a bug. Hyten’s remark proved the game had been a success. “[W]e have to make sure that we fail, and we fail quickly, and we learn from our failures and move fast,” he added in the same speech. When military leaders are unwilling to accept failure, they drive the entire Defense Department toward stagnation and safe bets, opening a window of opportunity for adversaries. The war game is a safe environment for failing fast—and learning to succeed.

In 2030, Beijing reaches a deadly decision: reunification with Taiwan at any cost. Cyberattacks plunge the island into darkness, confusion, and fear. Equipped with U.S. capabilities, Taiwanese defenses stave off the initial wave of Chinese missiles. At sea, the Chinese navy is attacked by swarms of unmanned submarines. As hundreds of landing craft speed unprotected across the Taiwan Strait, they are decimated by this unseen force. Over successive weeks, U.S. warships escort a steady stream of reinforcements. Supported by sensors from U.S. Marines and Special Forces, sophisticated missiles launched by long-range bombers sink the remaining fleet approaching the island. Taiwan begins repairing its infrastructure, mobilizes its reserves, and hunkers down for a long standoff.

The United States can certainly learn from winning a war game, but the lessons are usually narrow. What worked in a single war game has limited utility—it worked against a specific adversary making a specific set of decisions using a specific set of game rules that may or may not accurately reflect the world. Failure, on the other hand, doesn’t require the game to be a perfect simulation. We often hear complaints from players that our war game rules make the adversary “10 feet tall.” But it is better to stress U.S. forces more than to give the adversary too little credit and not stress U.S. forces enough. Stressing the capabilities of the U.S. forces to their breaking point from all sides allows analysts and researchers to identify vulnerabilities and what might be needed to fix them.

In 2030, Beijing reaches a deadly decision: reunification with Taiwan at any cost. Cyberattacks plunge the military ports on the Chinese coast into darkness, confusion, and fear. Hundreds of landing craft, unable to load at the ports, wait for further orders. Most of the Chinese missiles targeting Taiwanese military installations are intercepted by defensive batteries. At sea, the Chinese navy falls prey to advanced mobile mines and hypersonic missiles. U.S. warships lead regional allies and partners in shuttling critical munitions, supplies, and capabilities to the island. Although damaged, Taiwan’s infrastructure succeeds in rapidly transporting troops and supplies to defensive positions, readying the nation to repel the next wave.

There are many reasons why none of these narratives will come to pass. All it takes is one decision to shift the entire story. And in any war game—not to mention in real-life conflict—there are an untold number of decisions. Just as war games aren’t about victory or defeat, they’re also not critically determined by the so-called road to war, the initial circumstances that drive the game’s conflict. Instead, the dynamic heart of a war game is the way the players leverage and adapt current military doctrine, strategy, and capabilities—and apply them to the problems they face. Did predictable actions yield predictable results? Were there moments of insight or flashes of inspiration when players improvised? Novel decisions lead to new experiences, and new experiences can identify doors that lead to different and better outcomes.

So, in a war game, pay no attention to who won or lost. War-gaming is about the process, not the result—and analyzing that process is what will allow the U.S. military to turn losing into winning.

In 2030, Beijing reaches a deadly decision: reunification with Taiwan at any cost. The rest of the story?

Russia has lots of cool ideas.  Unfortunately for Russia, that also have a criminally corrupt economy and political system and a rapidly diminishing capacity to produce anything vaguely high tech.  In order to field and effective army, they will need to tackle their extreme corruption even as they burn more of their very limited resources on their military, and good luck with that.

The Russians will be using all Chinese technology soon enough, because they can't make their own, and they can't buy it from the West.  Russia shouldn't be ignored, but the US should be thinking about fighting China first and foremost.

1. True, but it's true of everywhere. What's happened in the North shows that Russia is prepared to give up on territory it can't hold and is using up resources.
2. This is key and the crucial issue, does Russia still have any ambitions of taking territory West of the river? If so then yes, giving up Kherson would derail those ambitious but I'm not convinced Putin has any ambitions like that anymore. If that's true I'm not aware of any other strategic value Kherson holds.
3. Retreating could be dangerous but it's much less dangerous than those forces being trapped on the west of the river. The sooner they fall back the safer that trust will be.
4. True, if they think they can hold it it will be very hard to push them out, but I go back to the point that I'm not sure it's worth holding anymore.
5. Locally or nationally? Nationally that ship has sailed, locally it only matters if you've got reason to hold that territory.
6. It would but the river's in the way and I don't think the a Ukrainians have the capability to do a contested river crossing. Russia's supply lines should be safe regardless of whether they hold Kherson.
7. I think you're agreeing with me on this point, avoiding becoming trapped in Kherson is paramount.
8. Does it? I thought the canal supplying water came from the river further north. I didn't think Kherson was key to protecting that.
9. True, but just as in point 1, Russia aren't focusing on tying up forces elsewhere, I'm not sure why Kherson would be different.
10. True, but again that didn't stop them withdrawing in the North

Their southern army certainly had supply problems - otherwise it wouldn't have gotten stuck at the end of its tether trying to reach Zaporizhzhia and Kryvyi Rih. The Russian Army's supply problems were not limited to the north, the terrain in certain areas was just easier, though not in the Dnipro theater and certainly not lately. They are limited in their power projection capacity from their railheads. Otherwise, how is it that they've barely moved north from their current frontlines above Mariupol for weeks? If they want to complete their alleged Donbass encirclement, they eventually need a southern prong, which I have yet to see forming.

And the Southern/Eastern fronts have also not been Ukraine's main focus when it comes to supply route interdiction.

I think he meant that the pressures of being outranged would create more demands and difficulties on them and degrade their ability to operate. Thus resulting in the loss of combat power of a mechanized unit when fighting an opponent with capabilities known to be superior.

The steelmanning may not be as extreme as you may think. The proliferation of drones, cell phones, cheap Chinese military hardware for radar, and encrypted communications means that the intel and targeting data is not out of grasp for even emerging economies. And the hardware and proficiency with the artillery itself is certainly possible by any military that can buy a battery.

&gt; If it comes down to trading battery for battery... the one with more batteries will come out ahead.

A good point that I think proves the author's point in away that the author did not. The US is an expeditionary military that will likely be fighting superior numbers of forces whenever it is called to fight a peer or near peer. 

So the strategy of having a war of attrition is a losing strategy for the US. It must either have overmatch to win over larger number of forces (or deter them obviously), or at least have parity where the enemy takes the threat of fighting US ground forces as a credible threat.

The threat of the US having a credible ground force is vital to the goals of US national security. There are millions of people around the world that the US has agreed to defend. And airpower alone can not deter an adversary or potential aggressor from attacking on land. 

For an example of this one needs to only look back to Iraq in 1991 or even 2003. All the time and precision munitions in the world could not change their behavior. In both case the US had air superiority and every type of precision guided bomb and missile available. But in both circumstance, at a certain point that wasn't enough. The attack stalled. 

In the end it took US and allied ground forces to make change happen. And the biggest and most powerful weapon of any ground military is artillery. 

There were absolutely artillery duels that the US engaged in with the Iraqis. If those duels were lost then the ground force would have been repulsed, or at least many more allied lives would have been lost to defeat the enemy. So the importance of the US military to have artillery that can at least keep up with what is already out there in adversary militaries is vitally important to US national security policies. 

There was also a bayonet charge by the British in 2003. The ability of Western militaries to do the core competency capabilities is not something that we should take for granted. Adversaries will notice if they are no longer credible and will adjust their strategies accordingly.

1.  Occupying Kherson provides negotiating leverage in talks, getting kicked out hurts the Russian position. 
2.  The current position is a significant bridgehead over the Dnieper.  If they leave, it will be very hard to retake the bridgehead and make any further attacks on the west side of the river all but impossible without a massive military build-up. Now that Ukraine has mobilized, it would be a bloodbath. 
2a.  Retaking Kherson even after crossing the river elsewhere is also hard (see Mariupol) and failing to take Kherson after re-crossing the river leaves a huge garrison behind which is also a military ""no-no"". basically, it creates huge tactical problems for any future offensives. You might be better off suffering huge losses trying to hold it than suffer those losses in the future if re-taking it is in your plans. 
3.  A retreat across the river will be dangerous, complex, and could result in many casualties and loss of materiel (see Kyiv). 
4.  Holding the city and defending against Ukraine is hard, but the Russians don't care about the city being destroyed, so they might prefer to fight in the city and force Ukraine to level it to take it back.  Defending is a city, even an occupied one acts as a force multiplier. 
5. They've been trying to install a puppet administration and hold referendums, which requires holding Kherson. 
6. Abandoning Kherson would bring Ukraine much closer to attacking the Crimea supply line that is absolutely necessary for Melitpol, Mariupol, and any potential encirclement of Donbass.
7.  If they don't retreat, they could become trapped, which is the absolute worst scenario. Their forces will inevitably surrender without resupply and all the downsides of leaving the Crimea supply lines vulnerable are even worse. 
8. It controls the water to Cirmea, as others have mentioned. 
9. Ukraine could economize forces by taking back Kherson (defending the river is much easier with less troops), allowing the Ukraianin forces to then be shifted to Donbass where things are more challenging. 
10. There might be significant evidence of war crimes they want to hide.

Like a chair with only one leg, it is an unwise idea to rest on it. 

The ability to be able to be a credible ground force is essential to a nation's deterrence. Especially the United States where the ability to defend and deter allies from aggressive neighbors is part of the mission. 

Furthermore the precision fires of the United States are a foolish way to attack masses of infantry and armored vehicles of a large military like Russia in Ukraine. Surely they are important but spending millions to attack every tank and defended position is not possible. 

Even the US with its great inventory precision guided munitions cannot defeat every piece of Russian armor in Ukraine with them alone. There are just too many of them, and risking premier stealth aircraft against a modern air defense network for every call of fires is foolish as well. 

I have seen this opinion before, and it seems that there are people who believe that unguided munitions is a threat to the dominance of air power in the US military. I can assure you that is not the case, they both have their place and are both important.

But that presupposes you know where your enemy artillery is located to understand if you are currently outranging them or not. Without supreme trust in your ISR and situational awareness, I can't believe any battery would choose to operate as if it could not be counter batteryed. 

In fact, if we were playing with the Russia encounter example, even if we did outrange Russian artillery, if we assume comparable C2, ISR and counter-battery (obviously we're steelmaning here), the Russians would employ the same ""risky"" tactics that the article talks about (actually we know that the Russians tend to employ these types of tactics - such as forward detachment of batteries anyways) to try to negate the range advantage, and quite possibly come out even or ahead. If it comes down to trading battery for battery... the one with more batteries will come out ahead. 

In all, I think this is a decent call to action piece, but nothing ground-breaking.

[The New Statesman has published an interview today with a former Putin adviser, providing a glimpse into the Kremlin worldview:](https://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/ukraine/2022/04/russia-cannot-afford-to-lose-so-we-need-a-kind-of-a-victory-sergey-karaganov-on-what-putin-wants)

&gt;*Russia cannot afford to “lose”, so we need a kind of a victory. And if there is a sense that we are losing the war, then I think there is a definite possibility of escalation. This war is a kind of proxy war between the West and the rest –  Russia being, as it has been in history, the pinnacle of “the rest” – for a future world order. The stakes of the Russian elite are very high – for them it is an existential war.*  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;*this is an existential war. If we do not win, somehow, then I think we will have all kinds of unforeseen political repercussions which are much worse than at the beginning of the 1990s. But I believe that we will avoid that, first, because Russia will win, whatever that victory means, and second, because we have a strong and tough regime, so in any event, or if the worst happens, it will not be the dissolution of the country or collapse. I think it will be closer to a harsh authoritarian regime than to the dissolution of the country. But still, defeat is unthinkable.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*...*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Stalemate means a huge military operation. No, I don’t think it is possible. I am afraid it would lead to escalation, because fighting endlessly on the territory of Ukraine – even now, is not viable.*  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;*escalation in this context means that in the face of an existential threat – and that means a non-victory, by the way, or an alleged defeat – Russia could escalate, and there are dozens of places in the world where it would have a direct confrontation with the United States.*",e363a13a18de9511acbbc44a1d23dd85f23e96fc,True,False,,,,,0,1649002107,,0,{},i38jp1t,False,t3_tva2jv,False,True,t3_tva2jv,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tva2jv/ukraine_megathread_april_3/i38jp1t/,1649002119,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648973307.0,

Artillery has been a decisive and important combat capability in the war in Ukraine lately. I would guess that the vast majority of the military and civilian casualties have been due to some type of indirect ground fire, and not fired by someone in the line of sight (direct fire) or air launched or dropped. 

Being one step ahead, or at least equal to, the capabilities of potential adversaries is something that every commander wants. No one wants to be in the situation where they will have to move around erratically to avoid being hit against an adversary who is both quantitatively and qualitatively superior. The two quotes I made from the article, however, demonstrate that this is exactly the situation the US would be in when fighting a land war. 

Some of this is due to the fault of failed attempts at modernization, that have left the US to soldier on with equipment developed in the 1960s.

Continuous movement may be required to shape the operation for the maneuver forces. At any given point in time, these elements will be in the range of indirect fire assets, which puts them in constant danger. 

&gt;Conclusion

&gt; No longer us the U.S. Army considered significantly superior against emerging near peer threats. The strongest of these threats, Russia and China, have improved their indirect fires capabilities considerably over the last couple of decades while the United States has focused on counter-insurgency threats. These nations also boast a significant amount of artillery overall, utilizing these assets at higher echelons within the ranks to devastate opponents. The U.S. Army needs to modernize its field artillery assets through more capable munitions and weapon systems to bridge the range gap. Even this may not be enough against a peer, which then may require further advancement of clever tactics and planning to establish an element of surprise and gain leverage over a potential colossal threat.

It appears that the Ukraineans disagree - even after weeks of facing the true horrors of war. And it is telling that you are not engaging the arguments but trying to make a stand on this quibble. 

Your position of appeasement could have some merit if argued properly. After all, unless you believe in some sort of reward in the afterlife, the dead have gained nothing and would be better off (read: alive) had they just given up any sovereignty and accepted whatever demands Putin may have had up to and including ursupation. 

However, they made a gamble: They risked their lives to defend their freedom from a foreign power dictating the future of their country. Those now dead have lost that gamble.

Salami slicing.  Ultimately, the goal needs to be breaking up the Federation.  Basically what Russia was trying to do with Donbas before it went Crazy Eddy.

There's no sane way to do that militarily.  So start offering autonomous Krais and Republics within Russia a better deal if they declare independence.  Basically, offer them the path to become Latvia 2.0.  A small but prosperous country with a thriving economy and good living conditions.  Let people pick between a good life xor remaining in Russia.  Russia's military will be exhausted and depleted after Ukraine, so Putin (or his successor) may be unwilling or unable to go full Grozny with every territory that tries to go independent.  And if the timing is right, it may simply be impossible to fight fixe or six such civil wars all at once.

Over 25-50 years of small nibbles, what's left of Russia becomes smaller, lower tax base, less important trading partner easier to maintain sanctions on, limited manufacturing base, etc.  At that point, it can either pound sand or go for reforms to be a art of the world again.",ab4b4363e9c2b3891868fbee451159d2a2274146,True,False,,,,,0,1648997933,,0,{},i389zxj,False,t3_tva2jv,False,True,t1_i388sxu,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tva2jv/ukraine_megathread_april_3/i389zxj/,1648997947,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648969133.0,

[],False,,Xyzzyzzyzzy,,,[],,,,text,t2_6qgej2g0,False,False,"I think the whole ""if we sanction enough, the people will overthrow the government"" is just another facet of the common belief in the US^1 in ""targeted sanctions"".

The theory behind targeted sanctions is that, supposedly, we are enlightened enough to realize that a populace and their government are different, and that bad policies are the government's fault, not the common people's. In the US, the high level of political polarization means that everyone intuitively understands the idea of large swathes of the population being at odds with their government. (At least, everyone who might have an opinion about foreign policy.) We have a problem with the Russian (Belarusian, Iranian, North Korean, Cuban...) government and elites, not the Russian people. So naturally, when we levy sanctions, we'll do so in a targeted manner - we'll levy sanctions that hurt the government, not the people. And if they do hurt the people, they'll be so obviously targeted that the people will know the blame lies with their government.

The problem is that this entire theory is hogwash. To the extent that targeted sanctions exist, they're so narrow in scope that they're mostly irrelevant. (""We're not going to sell North Korea any plutonium or ballistic missiles"".) Sanctions that are trying to actually have an effect on the world, especially ones that are trying to reduce a state's ability to make war, must interfere with the state's ability to freely acquire and direct resources toward increasing the state's ability to make war.

The resources that a state can, in theory, acquire and direct toward making war are *the entire economy*. That's why economies exist in the first place! Nowadays we get nice side benefits like sliced bread and iPhones and Steam, but that's a *very* recent development, historically speaking. We're very fortunate to live in a time when economic activity is often so far separated from war-making capacity. But war-making capacity is the foundation every economy is built on - the two can't truly be separated.

Since the largest and most important part of any state's economy is its population, you can't meaningfully hurt the economy without hurting the populace. Thinking that you're going to levy sanctions that will hamper Russia's ability to make war while avoiding harm to the Russian populace (because you have no quarrel with them, they aren't making policy) is like thinking that you're going to enter combat against the Russian military while avoiding harm to any enlisted troops (because you have no quarrel with them, they aren't making policy). *That is not how states work.*

If you want to levy sanctions against a country without substantially harming its population, you'd be better off not bothering, and instead [writing them a letter telling them how angry you are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc22CFhDBEM).",40d004a130602bf7ea1f19ceded6cb399a0622c8,True,False,,,,,0,1648973047,,0,{},i3789n9,False,t3_tuh4fq,False,True,t1_i373l88,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tuh4fq/ukraine_megathread_april_2/i3789n9/,1648973058,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648944247.0,

About the media: maybe I'm bitter from my experiences in the early Syrian Civil War, but the media was behind the curve there. As an example, entire villages of Yazidis were getting raped and pillaged, Mosul collapsed, etc. but it barely made the news until Obama finally increased intervention at the 11th hour. Same thing so many other times during that war, like with the Kobani siege.

Those of us in the Syrian Civil War sub had to cobble together news from unofficial sources.

The media was slow this time too; it felt like deja vu where I was telling family and friends in Dec/Jan to buckle up for a Ukraine war, but since mainstream news wasn't taking it seriously, they weren't taking it seriously, either.

Ironically, this time around we are STILL having to cobble together info from unofficial sources, but for a different reason: with the Syrian Civil War, there was lack of coverage and interest. This time around, there is too much interest such that any sub on the Ukrainian conflict is too diluted with low-quality content or propaganda.

So once again people are cobbling info from various sources, such as Trent Telenko's famous tweet about cheap Chinese tires and the stalled 40-mile convoy.

Putin enjoys higher approval rating because the middle-upper class aren't fighting the war, they are the ones dodging the conscriptions, they believe Putin's propaganda that they are winning the war, meanwhile the war is fought by the poor and ethnic minorities.

Don't get me wrong, the PLA did not perform well in the war at any measure, it was actually quite embarrassing compared to their performance against India 15 years ago, but it's also a stretch to compare it to the Winter War. The casualties are approximately equal (another huge rabbit hole since the PVAN heavily integrated militia, so the line is super blurred), and China did succeed in securing strategic positions on the border which gave it the edge in the decade long intermittent artillery skirmish that followed.

But more than anything it was a political war. Demonstrating the weakness of the People's War doctrine from the days of the civil war allowed Deng to sideline the old guard (ironic given he is the oldest of old guards) and make sweeping reforms to modernize the PLA. Additionally it was a direct attack against the Soviet Bloc, which allowed it to make the political pivot to a pro-US stance. Looking at the level of mobilization and the course of the war I don't think the idea that China is trying to seize Hanoi holds water.

However I would point out one aspect of this that DOES mirror the current Ukraine war - Demilitarization. During the Vietnam war much of the key industry was built up along the Chinese border as US bombing tended to shy away from coming too close to the Chinese border in fear of both Chinese-manned air defenses as well as Korean-esq intervention if bombs were to hit China. During this war, China seized some of the areas with most of the infrastructure, and destroyed them on the retreat, which is believed to have the effect of hindering the Vietnamese ability to become a threat to China.",a18cca55fe2a4d1118c73c22df45ba1fe9578930,True,False,,,,,0,1648961076,,0,{},i36rr9t,False,t3_tutc6g,False,True,t1_i365m59,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tutc6g/taiwan_isnt_the_ukraine_of_the_indopacific_try/i36rr9t/,1648961088,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648932276.0,

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/06/world/europe/ukraine-beats-russia-mykolaiv.html

&gt;Despite near-frantic warnings from the White House of an imminent Russian invasion in the weeks before it actually happened on Feb. 24, the initial attack took Colonel Stetsenko’s unit by surprise, he said. His brigade was at a training exercise near the border with Crimea outside a town called Oleshky and only half assembled when it received the order to prepare for battle.

&gt;“If we had received the order three or four days before, we could have prepared, dug trenches,” he said.

&gt;That delay nearly led to his brigade’s destruction in the first hours of the war, he said.

&gt;The Russian force that poured out of Crimea was five times the size of his Ukrainian unit and quickly overwhelmed it. His brigade had no air support and few functional antiaircraft systems, because most had been sent to Kyiv to defend the capital. Much of the brigade’s tanks and armored fighting vehicles were destroyed in the initial attack by Russian aviation.

&gt;The brigade’s commander, Col. Oleksandr Vinogradov, had lost touch with military leadership and was forced to make decisions on the fly, said Colonel Stetsenko, who was with the commander throughout. Encircled and suffering heavy losses from strikes by Russian fighter jets, Colonel Vinogradov ordered his remaining tank and artillery units to punch a hole through a unit of Russian airborne assault troops that had positioned itself at the Ukrainian brigade’s rear.

&gt;The maneuver allowed the main Ukrainian fighting force to cross a bridge over the Dnieper River and retreat west about 45 miles to Mykolaiv, where it could regroup and link up with other units to continue the fight.

&gt;“The fighter jets of the enemy attacked our tanks, several tanks were hit and burned, and the rest remained and did not flee,” Colonel Stetsenko said. “They knew that behind them were other people, and they gave up their lives to break through the bridge to dig in on the other bank.”

&gt;The tactic worked, but the costs were steep. By falling back to Mykolaiv, Colonel Stetsenko’s brigade had to sacrifice Kherson, which on March 2 became the first major city to fall to the Russian forces. They had no choice, Colonel Stetsenko said. If they had tried to defend Kherson, Russian forces could have flanked them and cut them off, opening a road to the west, and to Odessa.",16209724e12d8b11748ae987d72e00f45be6953e,True,False,,,,,0,1648954952,,0,{},i36gkjx,False,t3_tuh4fq,False,True,t1_i35dtrr,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tuh4fq/ukraine_megathread_april_2/i36gkjx/,1648954970,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648926152.0,

[],False,,cretan_bull,,,[],,,,text,t2_93kjo,False,False,"&gt; I was just saying that being honest about the uncertainty of your priors vs how thin the new evidence is, is reasonable.

Drawing a distinction between priors and data isn't useful in the context. Mathematically, it's all a probability distribution in the end. I agree, of course, that it is of paramount importance to be honest about uncertainty, wherever it comes from.

&gt; I'd emphasize that ""we don't know"" or ""data is ambiguous"" is expected to be the most common answer

&gt; ...

&gt; you appear to be in angry agreement of me

No, I don't think I am in agreement with you. There are only a few select circumstances in which ""we don't know"" is a good answer, and I don't think any of them apply here. Firstly, if you're not confident in your ability to model the situation, if you suspect that ""unknown unknowns"" might play a major role. Secondly, if you truly have so little data that the distribution can't be normalized.

That first case is almost always relevant to some extent, as an unspoken caveat that a Black Swan event could invalidate any predictions. But while there are certain contexts where outcomes really are dominated by Black Swan events (e.g. the possibility of nuclear war), in general it's not useful to refuse to make predictions because it's possible something entirely unpredictable could happen.

The second case only actually comes up in contrived scenarios where you have an improper prior and no data. For real-world predictions about practical things that should never be the case: the prior alone should always be normalizable.

What can happen is that you have a very wide prior, very little data, and a great deal of uncertainty. You appear to be saying that in these circumstances it is fine to say ""we don't know"". I am saying it is not fine to say that: at worst, with a completely flat distribution, you should be able to list a set of possibilities and say ""any one of these things could happen but there's insufficient data to meaningfully say which"", which is completely different. And in practice that never actually happens: even in circumstances which could be considered very uncertain the distribution is almost never actually completely flat.

&gt; with a review of 1st grade arithmetic that is unnecessary.

I'll be charitable and assume you're not deliberately missing the point.

If an analyst makes 10 predictions at 90% confidence and 1 of them turns out to be wrong, most people will ignore the successful predictions and point out ""they were wrong about X"". Despite the fact that the analyst has done absolutely nothing wrong and in fact seems to be perfectly calibrated as far as we can tell, this will reflect poorly on them. So, in practice, analysts are strongly disincentivized not to make predictions unless they are very confident in them, despite the fact that it would be very useful to have more well-calibrated predictions at a lower level of confidence.",3d33ea7c26680ece0dc9ad97244d17d50739accf,True,False,,,,,0,1648954930,,0,{},i36gj0s,False,t3_tuh4fq,False,True,t1_i366nwn,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tuh4fq/ukraine_megathread_april_2/i36gj0s/,1648954941,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648926130.0,

U.S. national security officials discussed the highly classified intelligence at a meeting in the White House on Oct. 27. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines warned that Russian forces could be ready to attack by the end of January 2022.

National security adviser Jake Sullivan posed several questions, including why Russia would take such a military action at that time, what the U.S. could do to harden Ukraine and how the U.S. might try to dissuade Mr. Putin. The gathering decided to send Mr. Burns on his mission to Moscow.

On Nov. 17, Ukraine’s defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, urged the U.S. to send air defense systems and additional antitank weapons and ammunition during a meeting at the Pentagon, although he thought the initial Russian attacks might be limited.

Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Mr. Reznikov that Ukraine could be facing a massive invasion.

Work began that month on a new $200 million package in military assistance from U.S. stocks. The White House, however, initially held off authorizing it, angering some lawmakers. Administration officials calculated arms shipments wouldn’t be enough to deter Mr. Putin from invading if his mind was made up, and might even provoke him to attack.

The cautious White House approach was consistent with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s thinking. He favored a low-profile, gradual approach to assisting Ukraine’s forces and fortifying NATO’s defenses that would grow stronger in line with U.S. intelligence indications about Russia’s intent to attack.
A paramount goal was to avoid a direct clash between U.S. and Russian forces—what Mr. Austin called his “North Star.”

Efforts to dissuade Mr. Putin from ordering an invasion, however, were faltering. When Karen Donfried, the top State Department official for Europe and Russia, visited Moscow in mid-December, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov handed her two fully drafted treaties: one with the U.S. and one with NATO.

The proposed treaties called for a wholesale revision of Europe’s post-Cold War security arrangements. NATO would withdraw all nonlocal forces from its Eastern European members, and the alliance would shut its door to former Soviet republics.

In a cavernous conference room at Russia’s foreign ministry, Ms. Donfried asked Mr. Ryabkov and the numerous other Russian officials present about the proposals. She received scant answers and left convinced that the demands had been drawn up at the highest level. The draft treaties were soon posted on a Russian government website, which added to U.S. concerns that the demands were diplomatic camouflage for a military decision it had already taken.

On Dec. 27, Mr. Biden gave the go-ahead to begin sending more military assistance for Ukraine, including Javelin antitank missiles, mortars, grenade launchers, small arms and ammunition.

Three days later, Mr. Biden spoke on the phone with Mr. Putin and said the U.S. had no plan to station offensive missiles in Ukraine and urged Russia to de-escalate. The two leaders were on different wavelengths. Mr. Biden was talking about confidence-building measures. Mr. Putin was talking about effectively rolling back the West.

On Jan. 9, as U.S. intelligence indications pointed ever-more-clearly to a full-blown invasion of Ukraine, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman met Mr. Ryabkov and a Russian general for dinner in Geneva. Ms. Sherman brought along Lieutenant General James Mingus, the chief operations officer on the Pentagon’s Joint Staff, whom she hoped might encourage the Russians to think twice about their invasion plan.

Gen. Mingus had fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, been wounded and earned a Purple Heart, and he spoke frankly about the challenges Russian forces would face. Invading a territory was one thing, but holding it was another, and the intervention could turn into a yearslong quagmire, he said. The Russians showed no reaction.

Not all U.S. allies believed its intelligence assessment. All could see that Russia was deploying a massive force on three sides of Ukraine. But most European allies found it hard to believe Mr. Putin would really invade.

In mid-January, Mr. Burns made a secret trip to Kyiv to see Mr. Zelensky. The U.S. now had even more information about Russia’s plan of attack, including that it involved a rapid strike toward Kyiv from Belarus. The CIA director provided a vital piece of intelligence that helped Ukraine significantly in the first days of the war: He warned that Russian forces planned to seize Antonov Airport in Hostomel, near the Ukrainian capital, and use it to fly in troops for a push to take Kyiv and decapitate the government.

European leaders made last-ditch attempts to talk Mr. Putin down. Mr. Macron visited the Kremlin on Feb. 7, where he was made to sit at the far end of a 20-foot table from the socially isolating Russian dictator.

Mr. Macron found Mr. Putin even more difficult to talk to than previously, according to French officials. The six-hour conversation went round in circles as Mr. Putin gave long lectures about the historical unity of Russia and Ukraine and the West’s record of hypocrisy, while the French president tried to bring the conversation back to the present day and how to avoid a war.

Could world leaders have been better prepared for Putin’s aggression? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.

Germany’s new Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who had succeeded Ms. Merkel only in December, fared no better at Mr. Putin’s long table on Feb. 15.

Mr. Putin opened the meeting with a forceful litany of complaints about NATO, meticulously listing weapons systems stationed in alliance countries near Russia. Mr. Putin then talked about his research on Russian history going back a millennium, about which he had written a lengthy essay last summer.

He told Mr. Scholz that Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians were one people, with a common language and a common identity that had only been divided by haphazard political interventions in recent history.

Mr. Scholz argued that the international order rested on the recognition of existing borders, no matter how and when they had been created. The West would never accept unraveling established borders in Europe, he warned. Sanctions would be swift and harsh, and the close economic cooperation between Germany and Russia would end. Public pressure on European leaders to sever all links to Russia would be immense, he said.

Mr. Putin then repeated his disdain for weak Western leaders who were susceptible to public pressure.

The German chancellor returned to Berlin far more worried than he had left it.

[],False,,bleepblopbloopy,,,[],,,,text,t2_4lu6l,False,True,"Mr. Putin’s show of military force backfired politically. He had won control of Crimea and part of Donbas, but he was losing Ukraine.

The country had long been deeply divided along regional, linguistic and generational lines. If young educated people in western Ukraine dreamed of Europe, older people and workers in eastern regions were more likely to speak mother-tongue Russian and look to Russia as the country’s natural partner.

Those divisions manifested themselves during Ukraine’s bitterly fought elections and during the Orange and Maidan revolutions. But they receded after 2014. Many Russophone Ukrainians fled from repression and economic collapse in separatist-run Donbas. Even eastern Ukraine came to fear Russian influence. Mr. Putin was doing what Ukrainian politicians had struggled with: uniting a nation.

Moscow sought to regain its political leverage in Ukraine by using the so-called Minsk agreements: fragile cease-fire deals brokered by Germany and France that aimed to end the fighting in Donbas. The agreements promised local self-government for separatist-held districts of Donbas within a decentralized Ukraine.

Ukraine’s new government under President Petro Poroshenko, elected in May 2014, which signed the Minsk agreements under duress, feared Moscow wanted to cement pro-Russian statelets within Ukraine that would limit the country’s independence. Moscow in turn accused Kyiv of failing to honor the accords. A low-level war in Donbas rumbled on until this year, claiming over 13,000 lives.

Mr. Putin never tried to implement the Minsk accords, said Mr. Heusgen, the German chancellery aide, because their full implementation would have resolved the conflict and allowed Ukraine to move on.

Ms. Merkel took the lead in Western efforts to talk Mr. Putin out of his course. Mr. Putin frequently lied to her face about the activities of Russian troops in Crimea and Donbas, aides to the chancellor said.

At a conversation at the Hilton Hotel in Brisbane, Australia, during a G-20 summit in late 2014, Ms. Merkel realized that Mr. Putin had entered a state of mind that would never allow for reconciliation with the West, according to a former aide.

The conversation was about Ukraine, but Mr. Putin launched into a tirade against the decadence of democracies, whose decay of values, he said, was exemplified by the spread of “gay culture.”

The Russian warned Ms. Merkel earnestly that gay culture was corrupting Germany’s youth. Russia’s values were superior and diametrically opposed to Western decadence, he said.

He expressed disdain for politicians beholden to public opinion. Western politicians were unable to be strong leaders because they were hobbled by electoral pressures and aggressive media, he told Ms. Merkel.

Despite having few illusions about Mr. Putin, Ms. Merkel continued to support commercial cooperation with Russia. On her watch, Germany became increasingly dependent on Russian oil and gas and built controversial gas pipelines from Russia that bypassed Ukraine and Europe’s east. Ms. Merkel’s policy reflected a consensus in Berlin that mutually beneficial trade with the EU would tame Russian geopolitical ambitions.

The U.S. and some NATO allies, meanwhile, began a multiyear program to train and equip Ukraine’s armed forces, which had proved no match for Russia’s in Donbas.

The level of military support was limited because the Obama administration figured that Russia would retain a considerable military advantage over Ukraine and it didn’t want to provoke Moscow.

President Trump expanded the aid to include Javelin antitank missiles, but delayed it in 2019 while he pressed Ukraine’s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to look for information the White House hoped to use against Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden and Mr. Biden’s son, an act for which he was impeached.

Russia, for its part, tried to end the U.S. military aid by hinting at a geopolitical swap. In March 2019, two Russian planes landed in Caracas, Venezuela, carrying military “specialists” to support Venezuelan strongman Nicolas Maduro. Russian commentators close to the Kremlin floated the idea of trading Russian support for Venezuela for American support for Ukraine.

Fiona Hill, the top NSC official for Russia, flew to Moscow the next month, where she told foreign ministry and national security officials there would be no trade, Ms. Hill recalled in a recent interview.

Mr. Zelensky, a former comic and political outsider, had won a landslide election victory in 2019 on a promise to clean up corruption and end the war in Donbas. But he aroused Mr. Putin’s scorn at their first and so far only meeting, a December 2019 summit in Paris where French President Emmanuel Macron and Ms. Merkel tried to break the impasse on implementing the Minsk accords.

Mr. Zelensky bluntly rejected Russia’s interpretation of the accords, recalled a senior French official who was present. “The Russians were furious,” the official said. Eventually, Messrs. Putin and Zelensky agreed on a new cease-fire and to exchange prisoners. Many present thought the Russian leader loathed his new Ukrainian counterpart, the official said.

Mr. Macron sought a rapprochement with Mr. Putin, even suggesting he could be a partner for Europe in managing China. He invited Mr. Putin to the Palace of Versailles and to his summer residence in the Fort of Brégançon on the French Riviera. Their conversations were mostly cordial and businesslike, according to French officials.

But in telephone conversations from 2020 onward, Mr. Macron noticed changes in Mr. Putin. The Russian leader was rigorously isolating himself during the Covid-19 pandemic, requiring even close aides to quarantine themselves before they could meet him.

The man on the phone with Mr. Macron was different from the one he had hosted in Paris and the Riviera. “He tended to talk in circles, rewriting history,” recalled an aide to Mr. Macron.

In early 2021, Mr. Biden became the latest U.S. president who wanted to focus his foreign policy on the strategic competition with China, only to become entangled in events elsewhere.

The U.S. no longer saw Europe as a primary focus. Mr. Biden wanted neither a “reset” of relations with Mr. Putin, like President Obama had declared in 2009, nor to roll back Russia’s power. The NSC cast the aim as a “stable, predictable relationship.” It was a modest goal that would soon be tested by Mr. Putin’s bid to rewrite the ending of the Cold War.

Russia positioned tens of thousands of troops around Ukraine’s eastern border as part of a spring military exercise. Meanwhile, Kyiv was cracking down on Mr. Putin’s Ukrainian friend and ally, the politician and oligarch Viktor Medvedchuk, shuttering his TV channel and placing him under house arrest for alleged treason.

In April, the White House considered a $60 million package of weapons for Ukraine. But after Russia ended its military exercise the administration deferred a decision to set a positive tone for a June summit between Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin in Geneva.

When Mr. Zelensky met with Mr. Biden in Washington in September, the U.S. finally announced the $60 million in military support, which included Javelins, small arms and ammunition. The aid was in line with the modest assistance the Obama and Trump administrations had supplied over the years, which provided Ukraine with lethal weaponry but didn’t include air defense, antiship missiles, tanks, fighter aircraft or drones that could carry out attacks.

Soon afterward, U.S. intelligence agencies learned that Russia was planning a military mobilization around Ukraine that was vastly greater than its spring exercise.",bea71c0475e45e5d30801ef2dfbbded8780bb2ae,True,False,,,,,0,1648951495,,0,{},i369l4o,False,t3_tuh4fq,False,True,t1_i369hy1,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tuh4fq/ukraine_megathread_april_2/i369l4o/,1648951506,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648922695.0,

[],False,,bleepblopbloopy,,,[],,,,text,t2_4lu6l,False,True,"In the final session, Ms. Merkel debated in a corner of the room with leaders from Poland and other eastern members of NATO, who advocated strenuously on behalf of Ukraine and Georgia. Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus strongly criticized Ms. Merkel’s stance, warning that a failure to stop Russia’s resurgence would eventually threaten the eastern flank of the alliance.

Mr. Bush asked Ms. Rice to go join the animated discussion. The only common language among Ms. Merkel, the east European leaders and Ms. Rice was Russian. So a compromise statement was negotiated in Russian and then drafted in English, Ms. Rice said.

“We agreed today that these countries will become members of NATO,” it read. But it didn’t say when. And there was no MAP.

Many of Ukraine’s supporters were heartened. But some officials in Bucharest feared it was the worst of both worlds. NATO had just painted a target on the backs of Ukraine and Georgia without giving them any protection.

“The fact is we rejected Ukraine’s application and, yes, we left Ukraine in a gray zone,” Radoslaw Sikorski, Poland’s foreign minister at the time, said in an interview.

Mr. Putin joined the summit the next day. He spoke behind closed doors and made clear his disdain for NATO’s move, describing Ukraine as a “made-up” country.

In public comments that day, he also questioned whether Crimea had been properly transferred from Russia to Ukraine during the Soviet era. Daniel Fried, who was the top State Department official on Europe, and Mariusz Handzlik, then the national security adviser to Poland’s president, jumped to their feet in shock. It was an early sign that Mr. Putin wouldn’t let the status quo stand.

Four months later, the Russian army invaded Georgia, exploiting a conflict between Georgia’s government and Russian-backed separatists. Russia didn’t take Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, but it showed it had no qualms about intervening in neighboring countries that wanted to join NATO.

Mr. Putin’s fears of a Ukrainian-style popular revolution infecting Russia were heightened by a wave of demonstrations in Russian cities beginning in 2011, when tens of thousands took to the streets to protest against the lack of democracy. “For fair elections” was the protesters’ slogan.

Mr. Putin believed the protests were a U.S.-sponsored effort to overthrow him, said Ivan Krastev, a Bulgarian political scientist who later attended a dinner hosted by Mr. Putin in Sochi. The Russian president told his guests that people didn’t take to the streets spontaneously but rather were incited by the U.S. Embassy, Mr. Krastev said. “He really believes it.”

The Kremlin organized large countermarches, which were billed as “anti-Orange demonstrations.”

Sporadic pro-democracy protests continued for nearly two years, despite rising repression. Mr. Putin cracked down on opposition parties, free media and nongovernmental organizations.

The concurrent Arab Spring protests, which toppled several authoritarian rulers in the Middle East, further heightened Mr. Putin’s fear, said Mr. Heusgen, the adviser to Ms. Merkel.

“He then became a fervent nationalist,” said Mr. Heusgen. “His great anxiety was that Ukraine could become economically and politically successful and that the Russians would eventually ask themselves ‘Why are our brothers doing so well, while our situation remains dire?’ ”

Ukraine hung in the balance again.

Mr. Yushchenko slumped to 5% of the vote in Ukraine’s 2010 presidential elections. Mr. Yanukovych won—fairly this time, said international observers—after campaigning for friendly relations with the West and also Russia. He found it was difficult to have both.

Mr. Yanukovych negotiated a free-trade agreement with the EU. At the same time, however, he was under pressure from Mr. Putin to join a customs union with Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. EU officials said Kyiv couldn’t do both, because the customs rules would clash.

The EU, following its standard playbook on trade and governance, demanded that Ukraine revamp its judiciary and improve the rule of law as a precondition for a trade deal. Russia used sticks and carrots: At various moments it blocked goods imports from Ukraine, but it also offered Kyiv cheaper gas prices and a $15 billion loan.

In November 2013, Kyiv abruptly suspended talks with the EU, citing Russian pressure. Mr. Putin called the draft EU-Ukraine deal a “major threat” to Russia’s economy.

At an EU summit in Lithuania, Mr. Yanukovych defended the suspension and asked the EU to include Moscow in a three-way negotiation about the deal. EU leaders replied that letting a third party infringe on others’ sovereignty was unacceptable.

“We expected more,” Ms. Merkel sternly told Mr. Yanukovych in a conversation caught on camera.

“We have great problems with Moscow,” Mr. Yanukovych replied. “I have been left alone for 3½ years in very unequal circumstances with Russia,” he said.





Anti-government protests spread across Ukraine that winter. The largest were on Kyiv’s central Independence Square, known locally as the Maidan.

On Feb. 21, a group of EU foreign ministers brokered a power-sharing deal between Ukraine’s government and parliamentary opposition aimed at defusing the crisis. But the massive crowd on the Maidan booed the agreement and demanded Mr. Yanukovych’s resignation. Riot police melted away from central Kyiv as they sensed power, and political cover, slipping away.

But the massive crowd on the Maidan booed the agreement and demanded Mr. Yanukovych’s resignation. Riot police melted away from central Kyiv as they sensed power, and political cover, slipping away.

The beleaguered Mr. Yanukovych sat in his office with Colonel General Sergei Beseda of Russia’s FSB, successor to the KGB, who had been dispatched by Mr. Putin to help quell the revolt. Gen. Beseda told Mr. Yanukovych that armed protesters were planning to kill him and his family, and that he should deploy the army and crush them, according to Ukrainian intelligence officers familiar with the conversation.

Instead, Mr. Yanukovych soon fled from Kyiv in a helicopter.

The Kremlin saw the turn of events as a coup by U.S. puppets and anti-Russian nationalists. In support of this view, Kremlin propagandists cited a video of two U.S. diplomats handing out cookies on Maidan to protesters and police after a night of clashes. Russian intelligence later leaked a recorded phone call in which the same two U.S. officials discussed who should be in the next Ukrainian government.

Mr. Putin held an all-night meeting with his security chiefs, in which they discussed the extraction of Mr. Yanukovych to Russia—and also the annexation of Crimea, the Russian leader later recounted. Mr. Yanukovych, who is believed to be living in exile, couldn’t be reached for comment.

Within days, Russian troops without insignia occupied the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow had affirmed as Ukrainian territory in three treaties in the 1990s. Crimea’s regional parliament, in a session held at gunpoint, voted to secede from Ukraine.

Russia also fomented and armed a separatist rebellion in the eastern Donbas region, Ukraine’s industrial heartland.

European leaders called Russia a “strategic partner.” German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder and Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi were among those who considered him a close friend.

Mr. Putin was personally active in facilitating good economic relations, recalled longtime German diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger. In one meeting, the issue of bureaucratic obstacles to German purchases of Russian wood came up. Mr. Putin phoned the relevant minister and resolved the matter in minutes.

“Putin said ‘Right, problem solved—what’s next?’ ” Mr. Ischinger remembered.

Perceptions changed in January 2007, when Mr. Putin vented his growing frustrations about the West at the annual Munich Security Conference. In a long and icy speech, he denounced the U.S. for trying to rule a unipolar world by force, accused NATO of breaking promises by expanding into Europe’s east, and called the West hypocritical for lecturing Russia about democracy. A chill descended on the audience of Western diplomats and politicians at the luxury Hotel Bayerischer Hof, participants recalled.

“We didn’t take the speech as seriously as we should have,” said Mr. Ischinger. “It takes two to tango, and Mr. Putin didn’t want to tango any more.”

His rage rising, Mr. Putin rattled through grievances. He shouted expletives at his translator, who was struggling to keep up.

In Ukraine, President Yushchenko was struggling to fulfill the hopes of the Orange Revolution that the country could become a prosperous Western-style democracy. Fractious politics, endemic corruption and economic stagnation sapped his popularity.

Mr. Yushchenko sought to anchor Ukraine’s place in the West. At the World Economic Forum in Davos in January 2008, he met with Ms. Rice, by then the U.S. Secretary of State, and implored her for a path to enter NATO. The procedure for joining the alliance was called a Membership Action Plan, or MAP.

“I need a MAP. We need to give the Ukrainian people a strategic focus on the way ahead. We really need this,” Mr. Yushchenko said, Ms. Rice recalled.

Ms. Rice, who was initially uncertain about having Ukraine in NATO, gave a noncommittal answer. When the request was debated in the National Security Council, Mr. Bush said NATO should be open to all countries that qualify and want to join.

A NATO summit was set for April 2008 in Bucharest, in the vast Palace of the Parliament built for Romania’s former Communist dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu. The alliance’s summits are usually well scripted in advance. Try as it might, the White House couldn’t overcome German and French resistance to offering a MAP to Ukraine and Georgia.

Berlin and Paris pointed to unsolved territorial conflicts in Georgia, low public support for NATO in Ukraine, and the weakness of democracy and the rule of law in both.

Ms. Merkel, remembering Mr. Putin’s speech in Munich, believed he would see NATO invitations as a direct and deliberate threat to him, according to Christoph Heusgen, her chief diplomatic adviser at the time. She was also convinced Ukraine and Georgia would bring NATO no benefits as members, Mr. Heusgen said.

Ms. Merkel told Mr. Putin in advance that NATO wouldn’t invite Ukraine and Georgia to join, because the alliance was split on the issue, but the Russian leader remained nervous, Mr. Heusgen recalled.

As the NATO summit approached, Mr. Bush held a videoconference with Ms. Merkel, but it soon became clear that no consensus would be reached beforehand.

“Looks like a shootout at the OK Corral,” Mr. Bush said, according to James Jeffrey, the president’s deputy national security adviser at the time.

Ms. Merkel was flummoxed by the American reference and turned to her interpreter, who confessed that he, too, had no idea what the U.S. president meant.

Over dinner in Bucharest, Mr. Bush made his case for giving Ukraine and Georgia a MAP—to no avail. The next day, Ms. Rice and national security adviser Stephen Hadley tried to find a compromise with their German and French counterparts.

Ms. Rice, a Soviet and Russia expert, said Mr. Putin wanted to use Ukraine, Belarus and Georgia to rebuild Russia’s global power, and that extending the shield of NATO membership could be the last chance to stop him. German and French officials were skeptical, believing Russia’s economy was too weak and dependent on Western technology to become a serious threat again.",ad1b2f3808a073a87a11914302d4f59f8b2a6f54,True,False,,,,,0,1648951430,,0,{},i369g7x,False,t3_tuh4fq,False,True,t1_i369d3p,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tuh4fq/ukraine_megathread_april_2/i369g7x/,1648951443,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648922630.0,

A diminished Russia needed cooperation with the West to modernize its economy, but it never reconciled itself to the loss of control over neighbors in Europe’s east.

No neighbor was as important to Russia’s sense of its own destiny as Ukraine. The czars’ takeover of the territories of today’s Ukraine in the 17th and 18th centuries was crucial to Russia’s emergence as a major European empire. Collapsing Russian empires lost Ukraine to independence movements amid defeat in World War I and again in 1991, when Ukrainians voted overwhelmingly for independence.

After the chaotic 1990s, the security-service veterans around Mr. Putin who took over Russia’s government complained bitterly about what they saw as the West’s encroachment on Moscow’s traditional sphere of influence in Central and Eastern Europe. An array of newly democratic countries that had been Moscow’s satellites or former Soviet republics joined NATO and the EU, seeing membership of both institutions as the best guarantee of their sovereignty against a revival of Russian imperial ambitions.

Viewed from elsewhere in Europe, NATO’s eastward enlargement didn’t threaten Russia’s security. NATO membership is at core a promise to collectively defend a member that comes under attack. The alliance agreed in 1997 not to permanently station substantial combat forces in its new eastern members that were capable of threatening Russian territory. Russia retained a massive nuclear arsenal and the biggest conventional forces in Europe.

Mr. Putin thought of Russian security interests more broadly, linking the preservation of Moscow’s influence in adjacent countries with his goals of reviving Russia’s global power and cementing his authoritarian rule at home.

The link became clear in Ukraine’s 2004 presidential election. Mr. Putin let the U.S. know in advance who should win.

When White House national security adviser Condoleezza Rice visited Mr. Putin at his dacha outside Moscow in May that year, the Russian leader introduced her to Ukrainian presidential contender Viktor Yanukovych. Ms. Rice concluded that Mr. Putin had arranged the surprise encounter to signal his close interest in the election’s outcome, she recalled in a recent interview.

Mr. Yanukovych’s initial election victory was marred by allegations of fraud and voter intimidation, triggering weeks of street protests and strikes that were dubbed the Orange Revolution. Ukraine’s supreme court ordered a new vote, which pro-Western candidate Viktor Yushchenko won.


The Kremlin saw the Orange Revolution as U.S.-sponsored destabilization aimed at pulling Ukraine out of Moscow’s orbit—and as a prelude to a similar campaign in Russia itself.

To ease Moscow’s concerns, the Bush administration outlined the limited financial support it had given to Ukrainian media and nongovernmental organizations in the name of promoting democratic values. It totaled $14 million. The White House thought the modest sum was consistent with Mr. Bush’s “freedom agenda” of supporting democracy but hardly enough to change the course of history.

The gesture only confirmed Russian suspicions. “They were impressed at the result that they thought we got for $14 million,” recalled Tom Graham, the senior director for Russia on Mr. Bush’s National Security Council.

Three months after losing Ukraine’s government to a pro-Western president, Mr. Putin decried the breakup of the Soviet Union as “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century.”

U.S. intelligence learned in 2005 that Mr. Putin’s government had carried out a broad review of Russian policy in the “near abroad,” as the Kremlin termed former Soviet republics. From now on, Russia would take a more assertive approach and vigorously contest perceived U.S. influence.

Ukrainian officials heard the message too. When President Yushchenko’s chief of staff, Oleh Rybachuk, visited the Kremlin in November 2005, he discussed the Orange Revolution with Mr. Putin. Mr. Rybachuk described the street protests as an indigenous movement of Ukrainians who wanted to choose their own political course.


Mr. Putin brusquely dismissed the notion as nonsense. He said he had read all of his intelligence services’ reports and knew the movement had been orchestrated by the U.S., the EU and George Soros, Mr. Rybachuk recalled in an interview.

At a separate encounter, Mr. Bush asked Mr. Putin why he thought the end of the Soviet Union had been the greatest tragedy of the 20th century. Surely the deaths of more than 20 million Soviet citizens in World War II was worse, Mr. Bush said. Mr. Putin replied that the USSR’s demise was worse because it had left 25 million Russians outside the Russian Federation, according to Ms. Rice, who was present.

Mr. Putin showed another face to Western European interlocutors, however, encouraging them to believe that he wanted Russia to be part of the wider European family. Soon after becoming president, he wowed Germany’s Parliament with a speech promising to build a strong Russian democracy and work with the West. Speaking in fluent German, perfected while he was a KGB officer in the former East Germany, he declared: “The Cold War is over.”",723463d85279b33e4f98c8f16fefeb2c8b25d7e4,True,False,,,,,0,1648951389,,0,{},i369d3p,False,t3_tuh4fq,False,True,t1_i369b3g,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tuh4fq/ukraine_megathread_april_2/i369d3p/,1648951399,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648922589.0,
[],False,,bleepblopbloopy,,,[],,,,text,t2_4lu6l,False,True,"In early November, months before the war began, CIA Director William Burns visited Moscow to deliver a warning: The U.S. believed Russian President Vladimir Putin was preparing to invade Ukraine. If he went ahead, he would face crippling sanctions from a united West.

The American spy chief was connected on a secure Kremlin phone with Mr. Putin, who was in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, isolated from all but a few confidants. The Russian leader made no effort to deny Mr. Burns’ charge. Instead, he calmly recited a list of grievances about how the U.S. had for years ignored Russian security concerns.

As for Ukraine, Mr. Putin told Mr. Burns, it wasn’t a real country.

After returning to Washington, the CIA chief advised President Biden that Mr. Putin hadn’t yet made an irrevocable decision, but was strongly disposed to invade. With European nations heavily dependent on Russian energy, the Russian military modernized, Germany going through a change of governments and the U.S. increasingly focused on a rising China, Mr. Putin gave every sign of seeing this winter as his best opportunity to bring Ukraine back under Moscow’s control.

Over the next three months, Washington struggled to persuade its European allies to mount a unified front. The U.S. itself was trying to balance two aims: talking Mr. Putin down while avoiding actions that he might treat as a provocation; and arming Ukraine to make an invasion as costly as possible.

In the end, the West managed neither to deter Mr. Putin from invading Ukraine nor reassure him that Ukraine’s increasing westward orientation didn’t threaten the Kremlin.

By now, this had become a well-established pattern. For nearly two decades, the U.S. and the European Union vacillated over how to deal with the Russian leader as he resorted to increasingly aggressive steps to reassert Moscow’s dominion over Ukraine and other former Soviet republics.

A look back at the history of the Russian-Western tensions, based on interviews with more than 30 past and present policy makers in the U.S., EU, Ukraine and Russia, shows how Western security policies angered Moscow without deterring it. It also shows how Mr. Putin consistently viewed Ukraine as existential for his project of restoring Russian greatness. The biggest question thrown up by this history is why the West failed to see the danger earlier.


Washington, under both Democratic and Republican presidents, and its allies at first hoped to integrate Mr. Putin into the post-Cold War order. When Mr. Putin balked, the U.S. and its European partners had little appetite for returning to the strategy of containment the West imposed against the Soviet Union. Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, led the EU’s big bet on peace through commerce, developing a dependence on Russian oil and gas that Berlin is now under international pressure to reverse.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization made a statement in 2008 that Ukraine and Georgia would one day join, and over nearly 14 years never followed through on membership. The EU drew up a trade deal with Ukraine without factoring in Russia’s strong-arm response. Western policies didn’t change decisively in reaction to limited Russian invasions of Georgia and Ukraine, encouraging Mr. Putin to believe that a full-blown campaign to conquer Ukraine wouldn’t meet with determined resistance—either internationally or in Ukraine, a country whose independence he said repeatedly was a regrettable accident of history.",3cc603724cb9b68fb264a5411af7dbb281c0c837,True,False,,,,,0,1648951363,,0,{},i369b3g,False,t3_tuh4fq,False,False,t1_i3680rg,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tuh4fq/ukraine_megathread_april_2/i369b3g/,1648951378,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648922563.0,
