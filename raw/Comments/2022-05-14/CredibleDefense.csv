&gt; A long period of “frozen conflict” follows. (1931-37, 2014-22)

Differences:

&gt; Ukrainian forces have been able to mount a resistance more successfully than Chinese forces were, due to having equal or greater quality training and organization to their opponents.

For cost, I think the housing market is ""cooling"" down, it was for sure over heated for the last 10 years, a damn bubble for sure..... well city center should be alright (given its the city center, no different than say New York prices ie insane, and the huge pop base means more competition, so only the more richer can go for those city center in the huge cities due to lack of availability). 


On demographics,. Yes, it isnt negotiable, but its more about if it keeps on the same route then its ""when"" which I am trying to guess here. 

Demographic problem is a ""time"" bomb but that needs a few generations to do it. 100 years is around 2-2.5 generations given the avg child birth age now is around 30-40. 

My estimate of no impact of the next 100 years based on the above, should be around correct given the transition to late child birth age similar to most modern econs in the world. With China converting their econ to more ""skilled labor"", it needs less manual labor, so any slight movement of a pop base within the next 100 years is countered by the conversion to skilled labor. I dont need to give examples given we are living in those examples.....",4226d5959540a76156036547d5169cb82cb7f838,True,False,,,,,0,1652565215,,0,{},i8mhye2,False,t3_uigw3g,False,True,t1_i8k8qf6,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uigw3g/deterring_china_a_victory_denial_strategy_the/i8mhye2/,1652565226,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652536415.0,

I am starting to think this is going to be the decisive engagement of the Donbas campaign. In order to actually make progress, the Russians have a few options, but none of them seem any good:

- Drive west around Barkhovine and try to encircle Slaviansk, which would basically be another repeat of the Russian long drive to Brovary to cut off Sumy, otherwise known as a guaranteed disaster for Russia. 

- Drive through Slaviansk to encircle the JFO. This is the simplest thing but Russia can't defeat the UA in fortified urban warfare unless the UA is already completely cut off. 

- Drive north from Popansa to Bakhmut. This seems like the best option, but for some reason the Russians don't want to re-deploy their forces to the south. Already they don't have enough forces to fix the UA in place where they need. Likely Russia needs their units in the north to quickly respond to UA counterattacks, which means they don't have the force to drive on Bakhmut (very similar to the SE campaign of the initial invasion, where Russia had the initiative to drive around Mykolaiv and take Odessa with a double-pronged drive from the north and amphibious landing, got mauled by a literal mob of farmers with ATGMs at Voznesensk, and decided to halt the campaign because they didn't have the force needed). 

- Try and cross the river at Liman or Bilohorivka again and hope they don't lose an entire battalion this time. As Mick Ryan says, there is no evidence Russia has enough combined arms skill to do that, and no reason to think they are getting any better.

All of this being done under the ricking clock that, at some point, the UA is going to start launching more serious attacks towards Izium or around the Siverkyi Donnets out of Chuihiv and try to cut off the large concentration of Russian troops. So I think the next two weeks are going to feature an abandonment of the ever-shrinking encirclement attempts and a focus on Severdontsk as the political trophy to claim success from this failed operation.

Soviet Union/Russia is just a series of matryoshka doll in country form?

Still, the way the Soviet Union dissolved relied on the way it was setup with constituent union republics having the explicit right to secede in Article 72 and when enough such union republics seceded, which included founding and most important members, the Soviet Union lost its sine qua non and even the last remaining member Kazakhstan left with the now newly independent republics trying to put the piece back with something like Commonwealth of Independent States to at least coordinate former Union institution like the military. 

But the story is closer to a power struggle between Boris Yeltsin, who was leader of the Russian SFSR, and Mikhail Gorbachev, who was President of the Soviet Union. Yeltsin essentially hollowed the stage from underneath Gorbachev by using the dissolution of the Soviet Union to put Gorbachev out of a job while remaining the leader of the most dominant union republic of the Soviet Union. Yeltsin got the nuclear launch code, got to move into the Kremlin, and the seat at the UNSC while subsuming all union institutions into Russian ones. The only price was to support other union republics in their quest to secede so the resulting state would be much smaller than the Soviet Union.

It is well known that the current Russia ruling class largely views that as one of the greatest geopolitical tragedies and I think that could be enough to deter a second try of it by the Russian Federation. So the only way that happens is violently and closer to a civil war than how the dissolution of the Soviet Union went down.",836e5435a178cb50a840afceec46fb41d546fd22,True,False,,,,,0,1652558903,,0,{},i8m4a3h,False,t3_upj4do,False,True,t1_i8l9v2p,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/upj4do/russias_coming_great_power_struggle/i8m4a3h/,1652558918,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652530103.0,

If they are intermixed then hazing is probably present, but wouldn't be to the degree under the Grandfathers, which was very much a problem due to a very specific enlisted manning system.

From the mid 1950s to late 2000s, the USSR/RU relied totally on conscripts for all enlisted ranks, including NCOs, who were shake and bake types. They all came in on two annual batches, so every unit was a mix of four types of conscripts based on which six month part of their service they were in. Those in the last six months were nicknamed the Grandfathers.

Due to issues with their shake and bake NCOs not being that great, and because the officers didn't stay in barracks with the troops or be around them all the time, the officers gave the grandfathers more power and responsibilities to help maintain order and discipline, which basically gave the equivalent of the Spec 4/Lance Corporal Mafia the power to play drill sergeant whenever they wanted. Which they naturally abused the fuck out of, because any hazing ritual that isn't tightly supervised gets out of control. But now all NCOs are professional contract troops who are long serving. They don't need privates to help maintain order and discipline. And they definitely don't need conscripts to do it.

Personally, I think Indonesia is a stabilising influence in that region and the ASEAN approach will temper both American and Chinese aggressiveness and assertiveness in a cycle-countercycle escalation, at least in that area. Both policymakers in Washington and Beijing would be wise to pay notice. However, Southeast Asia is just one of the pieces of China-US competition and other pieces may well intensify further even if it is keep out of ASEAN/SEA's neighborhood.

However, I think Australia's open assertiveness but hollow posturing is viewed with more disdain in Beijing compared to Indonesia's quiet diplomacy but solid consolidation. This is perhaps the difference between the Asian style of diplomacy compared to a more Western style one. 

&gt;Now the conflict is at the further reaches of Indonesia's EEZ.

And in the 1950-60, almost all of the straits and waters around Indonesia were international waters given the customary cannon shot rule at the time prescribed 3nm as the limit for territorial waters though some states claimed larger territorial waters(I cannot quite remember Indonesia's history on that though). So almost all those crucial internal straits that Indonesia has between her islands would have been international waters, and the archipelagic state principle enshrined in 1982 UNCLOS is perhaps a crowning achievement of the Indonesia diplomatic corp of that era, which was incidentally supported by a still Maoist PRC that still thought of itself of supporting the third nonaligned world despite clear issues later on that would show it to be a bad idea with respect to the PRC's national interest.",55213cf6b4f21e1e59973b09b4630f38b6e84259,True,False,,,,,0,1652556012,,0,{},i8ly3cg,False,t3_uos8rx,False,True,t1_i8lojvw,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uos8rx/scrutinizing_indonesias_naval_modernization_plans/i8ly3cg/,1652556027,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652527212.0,

And you're going to tell me *I'm* grossly misrepresenting reality?
What threats do Belarus, Zimbabwe, Burma, or Venezuela pose to the US?  Certainly not a security one.  And barely an economic one.

If there is no security threat and no real economic threat, what is the purpose of plunging an economy into volatility, collapsing its currency, and cutting off liquidity?  What is actually gained?  You see how quickly you equivocate on behalf of a policy that has no positive impact on Americans or American business opportunities, yet incredible suffering of millions?

The reality is that if there is no *real* threat reduction, the purpose of the pain is to empower domestic regime opposition and encourage the rise of pro-American national leadership.

In fact, regime change is such a well-understood primary motivation for sanctions that academic papers treat it as a given.

People always think sanctions work like this, but they don't work like this.

There is good reason why TARGETED sanctions were used.

If you cripple the russian population it does nothing but further cement Putin's status. Not only have we seized the 'backup plans' of all the oligarchs making them entirely dependent on putin for their ongoing position, historically under such conditions wealth has concentrated EVEN MORE towards the top.

The idea that it's gong to lead to popular uprising is the same fanciful nonsense behind so many terrible sanctions regimes in the past. Essentially all you're doing is seriously hurting normal people whilst pretending that actually it's a great moral success that's going to work *any day now*.

This paper makes some interesting points https://www.ceps.eu/ceps-publications/extraterritorial-sanctions-on-trade-and-investments-and-european-responses/

&gt;&gt; Economic sanctions like comprehensive trade embargoes often produce indiscriminate and perverse
effects in target countries. The humanitarian catastrophe caused by the comprehensive UN embargo
on Iraq in the early 1990s is a case in point (Mueller and Mueller, 1999). Economic decline in the targeted
state impoverishes the lower classes and weakens the middle classes, while the regime shields and
rewards the elites that support it. Faced with the prospect of living in an increasingly beleaguered
country, the intellectual elite often chooses to migrate. The business community finds it ever more
difficult to operate under the legal framework, which results in the criminalisation of commercial
activity (Schlichte, 2001). Because sanctions lend themselves to manipulation by leaders, the leadership
routinely uses them as a pretext to increase repression and tighten its control over the population and
the media, which allows it to monopolise the discourse on sanctions and present them as unjust
measures responsible for all the hardships people are confronting (Portela, 2014). Finally, sanctions
perpetuate isolation from the rest of the world, which frustrates those segments of society that would
benefit from enhanced international exposure: business elites, civil society groups, the political
opposition and even reform-oriented elements within the government (Will, 2003). There are plenty of
examples from the practice that took place in the aftermath of the Cold War, when the UN dramatically
increased its activity in peace and security. The 1990s were dubbed the ‘sanctions decade’ in view of
the dramatic rise in the number of sanctions regimes imposed by the UN Security Council (Cortright
and Lopez, 2000).",cb4ba870bfe06f96071f8062cffd56595ccae8b9,True,False,,,,,0,1652552167,,0,{},i8lps55,False,t3_upj4do,False,True,t1_i8l8f6j,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/upj4do/russias_coming_great_power_struggle/i8lps55/,1652552183,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652523367.0,

Do you know how the Indonesians plan to do that? Well by inviting more people to the party !!!! [Joint US-Indonesia war games to expand to 14 nations as tensions simmer in Indo-Pacific](https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/08/asia/indonesia-us-military-exercises-intl-hnk-ml/index.html).

A free and active foreign policy doesn't mean neutrality. It means Indonesia won't join the permanent alliance but prefers loose ""partnerships"". That was its interpretation during the Cold War. But at the end of the day, it meant siding with the bloc that was best able to meet its objectives  In 1950-60s, it was reclaiming Papua. That was Indonesia's obsession during the period.  They threw the diplomatic kitchen sink at that objective.

For Indonesia, the situation now is a cakewalk compared to Cold War tensions during the 1950-the 60s. Other countries in the region like Singapore/Philippines think the current situation is challenging, to be frank, it is not.

The reason is that Chinese and Western influence in Southeast Asia, in general, has declined since the 1960s. The difference between the West is they realize it, but most Mainland Chinese don't, because they think of power relative to the West, not actual influence.

&gt; * Yet, the army’s opaque recruitment procedures, multiple chains of command, lack of training and poor budget management could compromise the benefits of this redeployment.

&gt; * Failure to create an army that is representative of the population and financially sustainable could undermine soldiers’ loyalty to the state and push them to rise up or join a new rebellion, as they have in the past.

&gt; * Ethnic polarisation in the rank and file and nepotism on the part of heads of state in the capital Bangui have long hindered the creation of an army capable of securing the country. 

&gt; * …each battalion is part of a different chain of command, answering either to the general army staff, the Defence Ministry or even the presidency.

&gt; * The government argues that these recruitments are a necessary response to the December 2020 rebellion, which it claims forced it to expand the FACA. 

&gt; * Russian instructors began training FACA soldiers after the UN authorised their presence in the country in 2018, while the EU ran a separate military training program. Since the EU suspended that program in December 2021 over concerns that Wagner was interfering with FACA’s command, Russian instructors have become fully responsible for military training.

&gt; * On the ground, these concerns translate into very real consequences. For soldiers, their lack of training has meant that they are ill-prepared on the battlefield, which is contributing to deteriorating relations with Wagner troops. Since their deployment in December 2020 to support the army’s counteroffensive, Russian forces have de facto assumed command of the FACA on the battlefield. Several observers described to Crisis Group the troops’ growing discontent with how Wagner mercenaries humiliate and physically abuse Central African officers and soldiers.

&gt; * The CAR is at a turning point in its stabilisation process.

Look for the fringes, as that would be where a revolt in Russia would start. 

Also, the situation in Hungry and Belerus is another thing to watch. They are indicators of Russia's ability to project power. And if they go strong anti-Russia, it's a sign that Russia is falling apart. The reasoning is that if Alexander Lukashenko of Belerus's power is based on Russian backing.

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"It depends on how it's done.The current Russian system of mobilization only does a few things:

- It pulls in the reserves
- Allows conscripts to be used in foreign wars
- Lengthens conscription terms of service from 12 months to indefinite
- Forces a higher level of discipline on contract troops that increases punishments and removes their ability to refuse orders or resign

These are all things that can massively help the Russian military but there are caveats.

For instance, they are not set up to induct large numbers of untrained or poorly trained personnel. While there are probably many thousands in the reserves who are former RuGF combat arms, most of the two million aren't. Of the current crop of conscripts, fewer are combat arms, so they'll need to train many tens of thousands in various jobs like infantry, tanks, recon, arty, as well as whatever combat support jobs they need too. But there is no existing system to do that, to create the administration and logistical infrastructure to create the camps needed to induct and train everyone, as well as the knowledgeable instructor cadre, it means raiding existing units for personnel, units who are largely deployed to Ukraine and need those personnel. Robbing Peter to pay Paul.

When it comes to existing combat units, there aren't enough for the long run if Russia wants to prosecute this war indefinitely. They need at least 2x more in Ukraine to have an advantage over the UA, plus more to beef up their border security especially in the Western Military District, which needs to be completely relieved from Ukraine and put back on the border or else their security is jeopardized forcing them to rely on nukes, which isn't good. 

To create the backbone of all these new units requires more raiding of existing units, they need experienced officers of all ranks and jobs, NCOs and veteran junior enlisted too. So that will be two separate raids on existing units in Ukraine that have already been weakened severely by losses, the second will be far worse than the first.

And that doesn't account for economic issues paying for the mobilization, morale and political issues, logistical problems to come up with everything needed from uniforms to heavy equipment, turning their military economy from mostly off to 24/7 multiple shifts, etc.",6be9b3ef8c38a7f97016f89d2fb65ab5b18002a3,True,False,,,,,0,1652546022,,0,{},i8lc7vr,False,t3_upfrh6,False,True,t1_i8l5i65,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/upfrh6/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_14_2022/i8lc7vr/,1652546035,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652517222.0,

https://taskandpurpose.com/analysis/russia-ukraine-cell-phones-track-combat/

&gt; * It’s been a nightmare scenario for U.S. commanders for years: An amphibious readiness group sails stealthily towards its objective, one reckless Marine or sailor goes topside and uses a personal cell phone to check Facebook, revealing the position of the assault ship. The Chinese or Russians quickly detect the cell phone signal in the middle of the ocean and realize they can’t miss. The enemy fires its anti-ship ballistic or cruise missiles at Pfc./Seaman Schmuckatelli as he posts a meme and suddenly the entire ship along with thousands of sailors and Marines are lying on the ocean floor.

&gt; * When Russian troops cross into Ukraine, their cell phones emit a roaming signal that connects to Ukraine’s cellular network, allowing the Ukrainians to triangulate where the Russians are by using the closest three cell towers, said Artem Starosiek, CEO of Molfar, an open-source intelligence community based in Kyiv.

&gt; * Amid numerous reports that the Ukrainians can track and target Russian troops when they use cell phones, one question remains: Why don’t the Russians destroy Ukraine’s cellular network?

&gt; * The answer: They need it, said James Lewis, a technology expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, D.C.

&gt; * Corruption could be another factor that has played into why the Russian military has proven to be so poor at using secure communications, he said.

&gt; * “There are good examples – not always public – of the Russians identifying a security goal and then allocating, in one case, $10 billion to it; and $5 billion of it ended up in Switzerland,” Lewis said.

&gt; * Looking at the Russian failures in Ukraine so far, it’s tempting to think the militaries of NATO members wouldn’t make the same mistake, but they have. In November, Polish troops that had been deployed to the border with Belarus left the dating apps on their cell phones on. Just across the border in the city of Grodno, the Belarusians knew exactly how far away the Polish troops were.

&gt; * ...the Defense Department banned troops from using cell phones, fitness trackers, and other devices that use geolocation features, and now many offices in the Pentagon require people to leave their cell phones in lockers outside. A subsequent New York Times investigation revealed that companies can track people’s smartphones inside the Pentagon by using software on mobile phone apps.

&gt; * In 2020, a bored Marine lance corporal got his entire artillery unit “killed” during an exercise at Marine Corps Air-Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms, California, when he used his cell phone to take a selfie, Military.com reported.

&gt; * Commanders have known for years that U.S. troops forces have lost their fieldcraft skills at hiding their electronic, thermal, infrared, and visible signatures, said retired Gen Robert Neller, the former Marine Corps Commandant.

&gt; * A few years ago, the I Marine Expeditionary Force conducted an exercise to find out which part of the base had the largest electromagnetic signature, he said.

&gt; * “The most readily apparent thing from high overhead was the billeting area, where people were living, because they all were using their phones,” Neller said.",2b442ec1b79ac18a7c31293b31d5c21563bd90df,True,False,,,,,0,1652545146,,0,{},i8la90m,False,t3_upfrh6,False,True,t3_upfrh6,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/upfrh6/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_14_2022/i8la90m/,1652545158,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652516346.0,

Reasoning, all evidence points to a weakening Russia. And a weak Russia will not be able to hold on to territory by force. Force is the main method for Georgia and Chechnya. And if Russia didn't have tanks or infantry, they won't be able to do anything. 

There also could be other satellite states that could break from Russia. I'm not well versed in Russian territories to know which ones will break first. The revolts could be supplied by Ukraine or Poland.

Interesting portion of the article on fiscal policy. They think they can keep funding the government at normal levels for 3-4 months, after which harsh austerity or an infusion of more foreign aid (or combination of the two) will be needed 

&gt;Reasons not to panic are quite numerous. Ukraine went into the war in good shape, with its economy growing at an annualised quarter-on-quarter pace of almost 7%; strong prices for its exports of grain, iron and steel; a well-regulated banking industry and a government deficit of less than 3% of gdp last year. Its debt stood at just under 50% of gdp, a number that many finance ministers can only dream of. An impressively digitised tax and benefits system means that revenues are still coming in smoothly from the parts of the economy that are still functioning. Pensions and government salaries are all still being paid, even in areas that are now under Russian occupation, thanks to resilient digital systems and a surprisingly unscathed internet. Most businesses, for now, are still paying their employees, even if they cannot operate as normal, or at all. Amazingly, payroll taxes are down by only 1%, the minister says.

&gt;But it isn’t easy. The World Bank has predicted that Ukraine’s gdp will shrink by perhaps 45% in 2022. (“Our estimate is 44%,” Mr Marchenko grimaces.) And both estimates are, of course, hugely uncertain. Customs revenues, a significant part of the government’s tax take, have crashed to around a quarter of their pre-war level thanks to lower imports and the suspension of many duties. Military salaries are another big burden. It all adds up to a financing gap of around $5bn every month, he says. That is roughly 5% of Ukraine’s depleted gdp for every month that the war goes on.

&gt;The imf has helped as well. It has encouraged America and other countries to take over part of Ukraine’s allocation of special drawing rights at the fund, in effect channelling hard currency to the government in Kyiv. But the end result of all these appeals is that, for the second quarter of this year, Ukraine has so far totted up grants totalling only about $4.5bn, against a fiscal shortfall of $15bn.

&gt;How to fill that? In part, Mr Marchenko says, by having the central bank print more money. In part, too, by issuing war bonds, on which the government currently is paying around 11% interest, which is less than the inflation rate. But the main source will need to be foreign. And that, the finance minister says, is how he spends most of his day, lobbying foreign governments for help. America is where he has the highest hopes. On April 28th President Joe Biden said he was asking Congress to authorise a further $33bn in new funds for Ukraine, since a previous facility is almost exhausted. The House of Representatives has voted to raise the amount to $40bn. Most of the money will be for arms, but at least $8.5bn is for economic support. “It’s good news, but what will the American package look like, and when will it arrive? We don’t know,” says the minister.

&gt;This is not sustainable, admits Mr Marchenko, who fears that if the war lasts more than another “three or four months”, painful measures will be needed, involving huge tax rises and swingeing spending cuts. The real fear is that what has become in recent years a fairly market-driven, freewheeling economy might see a wave of nationalisations, undoing years of hard-fought progress.",57681dfd57d941838bf3aefece7e855fbe2bf508,True,False,,,,,0,1652542559,,0,{},i8l4i5t,False,t3_upfrh6,False,True,t3_upfrh6,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/upfrh6/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_14_2022/i8l4i5t/,1652542575,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652513759.0,

The underground complex was originally designed as a nuclear bunker... but its been used as a redoubt right now, and since 2014 its likely been part of UA planning to use it as such in the event of a Russian attack.

If I was taking an old nuclear bunker and converting it to a redoubt... pretty much the first thing I'd do (maybe the 2nd after fully stocking it with food, water and ammo) is extend the complex such that it has multiple entrances/exits outside the current plant/off of any maps that russia posses of the original bunker.

--------------

&gt; * As sanctions take their toll and battlefield losses mount, the gap between Putin’s ambitions and Russia’s capacity is likely to grow. As a leader obsessed with geopolitics, Putin will inevitably engage in a desperate scramble to maintain Russia’s great power status, but he will find it incredibly difficult in the weeks, months, and years ahead to do so.

&gt; * Banks do not stop tanks, after all. 

&gt; * But instead, by imposing significant medium- to long-term costs on Russia, such that in the next 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years, the Russian economy would be severely weakened, the Kremlin would be forced into a tough juggling act between guns (geopolitical ambition) or butter (domestic tranquility).

&gt; * What has surprised U.S. policymakers is the speed and intensity through which the U.S. and European public have demanded stronger actions. European outrage has led to a far stronger sanctions response than imagined possible be for the war. Europe has demonstrated it is willing to bear substantial economic costs to weaken Russia and is now moving at an incredible pace to decouple from Russia, now targeting Russian oil.

&gt; * If the war ended tomorrow, Russia would have considerable costs to recapitalize its forces—build more tanks and Kalibr cruise missile systems, as well as train new personnel—not to mention seek to address the deficiencies exposed in the war. But the war is not going to end tomorrow, and the long-term costs to Russia will grow.

&gt; * …how will Russia be able to rebuild its military when it cannot buy semiconductors to build new Kalibr cruise missiles? When a Western component used to manufacture Russian tanks breaks, will Russia be able to get another? If not, can it build its own? According to the White House, two major plants that specialize in manufacturing and repair of tanks—Uralvagonzavod Corporation and the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant—have suspended their work due to the lack of foreign components.

&gt; * It will, in short, act like North Korea.

&gt; * …even if Russia finds a way, acquiring items through the black market and through convoluted means will add substantial costs, further depleting Russia’s economic coffers.

&gt; * Whether export controls succeed in starving Russia of the technology and machinery necessary to rebuild its military is of immense geopolitical importance.

&gt; * India is dependent on the Russian arms industry and has $8 billion worth of outstanding military orders from Russia, and also needs a continuous supply of spare parts and components. 

&gt; * If Russia can’t deliver, India will have to scramble, increasingly turning to U.S., European, and Asian partners for alternatives. 

&gt; * In Southeast Asia, Vietnam is reliant on Russia’s defense industry and could be further alienated by closer Sino-Russian relations. Furthermore, 50 percent of Africa’s defense industrial imports come from Russia.

&gt; * Thus, if sanctions and export restrictions work as expected, Putin will have to scramble to maintain Russia’s global standing. 

&gt; * Russia could also continue to look to asymmetric means to hit back and impose costs on the West. Cyberattacks, political influence and disinformation campaigns, money laundering and corruption efforts are few of the many tools in its toolbox. However, its effectiveness has eroded somewhat, as Russia has lost the element of surprise.

&gt; * Russia is thus in a real geopolitical bind. Putin will scramble to maintain Russia’s geopolitical standing, but the options in front of him may be limited. However, the success of Western strategy also could plant the seeds of its own failure by creating a sense that Russia poses less of a threat, prompting focus to shift elsewhere.

&gt; * Maintaining restrictions will thus require enormous bureaucratic attention and energy, as well as extensive multilateral coordination, not just in 2022 but in the years ahead.

&gt; * Putin will thus bank on the West lacking the focus and energy to maintain the pressure. It is up to the West to prove him wrong.

Since then we've developed the Small Diameter Bomb, a 250 lb bomb with an enormous glide range and multiple seeker modes, designed to be carried in clusters of 4 on the pylon used for a 2000 lb bomb. That gives you at least 16 shots per sortie for non-stealth aircraft, yes some of them will miss, you probably won't even find targets for all of them, but you're still looking at doing a heck of a lot of damage with the kind of air superiority the US always establishes. Then we have similar weapons to be fired from our rocket artillery with ranges up to 90 miles, and while our tube artillery is falling behind it can still contribute something. So a large part of the strategy is to simply not have to do it.

Remember also that destroying the bridge does not automatically mean everyone at either end dies, that happened because the UA was able to continue putting huge amounts of fire into the area. A quick counter-battery response, thanks to the combination of air superiority, counter-battery radar, and good communications with artillery units, should be able to prevent the majority of that.

What esteemed Marshall Girkin forgot to mention is uh... Suvorov actually proceeded to storm and take all of Izmail in **one day** after his big bombastic threat.  31k troops into 40k.  One day.  I think if Russians were capable of that then yes, Girkin's analysis.

But we're in a position where we're even talking about this because the Russians this time around.... didn't do that.  Not even close.  It's unclear when they'll actually close the caper, and it seems that after a month of expecting the Azovstal defenders to surrender ""very soon"", it's increasingly likely they'll stand and martyrize, if it comes to that.

In light of the upcoming talks announced by I. Vereshchuk, an official of the occupation administration of the so-called "" ukraine"", on the exchange of severely wounded Nazis from the encircled ""Azov"" in Mariupol for Russian prisoners of war, I state the following:

1. If such an exchange really takes place - it will be another and HUGE step towards the defeat of the Russian Federation in the ongoing war.
2. Whoever in the Russian Federation will sanction such an exchange will de-facto commit an act of TREASON to his state and his army (no matter how he disguises this betrayal de-jure and whatever he thinks about it).

Justification:

As I have written many times - ALL military theorists have singled out as the main task of any military operations - the DESTRUCTION and/or DEVASTATION of the enemy's military forces. Because to achieve a decisive victory over the enemy without crushing his main armed forces - if anyone managed to do it, only very rarely and in unique circumstances. For example, in the case of internal turmoil in the enemy (Russia, 1917) or the ability to completely paralyze its economy without engaging its own ground forces (Yugoslavia, 1999).

One of the main components of defeating the opposing army is to inflict a MORAL defeat on it. That is, undermining the belief of the majority of enemy soldiers and officers in the possibility of victory and/or in at least a relative likelihood of surviving the war personally.
At the same time History knows many cases when far from being physically defeated the army laid down arms and collapsed precisely because of moral breakdown (Prussia after the first defeats from Napoleon in 1806, France in May 1940, etc., etc.). And vice versa - if there was no moral breakdown, even by all accounts defeated troops continued to fight hard, inflict high losses on the enemy and have a significant impact on the final outcome of the war.  

In our particular case (so as not to produce a pseudo-theoretical article, I will "" reduce the scope"") we are talking about the siege of a fortress, stubbornly and quite successfully defended by a staunchly selected garrison, manned by the ""cream of the crop"" of the enemy armed forces and already converted by propaganda into a ""banner of resistance to the aggressor"".
And - in our case - the VICTORY in this battle will have long been determined not by ""formal parameters"" - by the occupation of some ""landmark point"" (the Azovstal plant), but precisely by the fate of the garrison. The more enemy soldiers and officers manage to avoid death and captivity, the more chances that the battle for Mariupol and Azovstal will be perceived by the enemy army as a victory. With appropriate conclusions: ""in all such situations one must stand to the end, inflict as heavy losses on the Russians as possible, and then the cowardly stupid Russian Untermensch will let us out of the encirclement anyway, and we will return home as heroes, having contributed greatly to the inevitable final victory.  

And on the contrary - complete destruction of ""Azov and allied"" - will mean for the enemy a clear example of the REAL destruction and will essentially influence the behavior of the new ""fortresses"" garrisons being prepared right now.
That is - in simple words and in short - to let at least some enemy out of the ""fortress"" without capturing them means to multiply your own losses in the future and significantly increase the enemy's morale. And this is a defeat for us.

In general, the only thing our military-political authorities had to say before the beginning of the assault was to repeat the words of A.V. Suvorov before the attack of Izmail:

""I arrived here with the troops. Twenty-four hours to consider - and freedom. My first shot will become unfreedom. The assault is death"".

And after that - to destroy the enemy till the moment when all the survivors throw down their arms and throw out the white flags without any conditions. As it was in Izmail, 2/3 of the garrison was destroyed in the battle, and the rest (having thrown weapons) went into captivity.",90b8085155d601cb4854def100923645d2da4c6c,True,False,,,,,0,1652529768,,0,{},i8kga9p,False,t3_upfrh6,False,False,t3_upfrh6,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/upfrh6/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_14_2022/i8kga9p/,1652529780,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652500968.0,

Probably not without control of the black sea (Hence the Navy comment above). There are approaches Russia can easily make from Russian territory to the ports on teh south coast that Ukraine couldn't cover with land based missiles based in southern Ukraine.

So Russia can always keep the peninsula supplied by sea, even if you take down the Kerch Bridge... which it isn't guaranteed Ukraine could even do if Russia still control the sea.

&gt; I am not sure how could they succesfully cross into it (maybe with a 1000+ top of the line artillery with 10000 high tech shells each? Literally with a moving barrage. I really dont have a better idea (and of course, russian black sea navy destroyed and air power is mostly or completly ukraine controlled)

Without any prospect of an amphib landing (another reason for that Navy), storming Crimea may be a bridge too far.

They've got that tiny bottleneck to negotiate thats only 7km wide, then 40-50km of swampy land with no cover just beyond with just a few solid routes through it in which to form new bottlenecks, then miles and miles of open steppe with no cover beyond that, and then finally a range of mountains (!).... and they've got to push the Russians out of all of that before they get to Sebastapol.

Its a defenders dream, and the one place in Ukraine that Russians would defend like they'd defend ""Russia proper"".....because they absolutely consider it ""Russia proper"".

Hence also why I said ""Nuclear Deterrance"" too.... because at some point, if russia is losing a conventional assault they may just decide this IS an attack on ""Russia Proper"" and use a Tac Nuke.

With that incredibly narrow bottleneck to Nuke, they can cut off any army that has successfully penetrated past that at any time by severing lines of communication with a nuclear strike, and mop up the cut off from supply remnants.

Hence....a Navy AND A Nuclear Deterrance is required.

I am no sure Crimea can be considered militarily acheivable at a cost in lives Ukraine would be willing to pay, no matter how much their army outclasses Russia's.

Or at least.... not until they've got sea dominance in the Black Sea and the ability to do large scale amphibious landings .... and their own nukes to deter a last ditch ""Nuke the supply lines/troop concentration at the bottleneck and auto-win"" stratgey anyway.",7c59e703a64433249774a77ce28798928e8d7492,True,False,,,,,0,1652527333,,0,{},i8kcv4h,False,t3_uoq4bh,False,True,t1_i8j0kfx,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uoq4bh/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_13_2022/i8kcv4h/,1652527343,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652498533.0,

&gt; China's numbers this year should be the same as the last two years, I think it will turn better next year though.

And maybe it won’t. Cost of living is getting higher in China, crazy work hours and so on. Richer and wealthier countries than China with better working conditions could not boost their fertility rate.

&gt; But yea that is another problem is we are also looking at %, and not nominally. Nominally given its huge population base means it is enough to deal with for what? 100+ years down the line, but China also has the econ housing and jobs to deal with the increase of population. But US on the other hand is ill-prepared given the damn housing costs has skyrocked even though there are tons of ""new"" homeless which doesn't make much sense for a new home buyer or hell renter and the immigrant tends to be not skilled labor so doesnt help much. (I prob wont be able to buy a house here in my home town)

Housing in China is [more expensive](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=China&amp;country2=United+States) than in the United States. Renting is about half the cost, but salaries are also 6x lower so comparatively rent is around 3x more expensive in China than the US. 

It is a joke that you’d bring up housing as a strength for China. [housing in China is nearly 3x as expensive as it is in the UK](https://lipperalpha.refinitiv.com/2020/06/chart-of-the-week-chinas-house-price-to-income-ratio-exceeds-17/#). And looking at [numbers from American cities](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-29/how-many-years-of-income-does-a-home-in-your-city-cost) housing in China is nearly 2x as expensive as it is in the *notoriously* expensive LA.

&gt; But yea, the demographic bomb is a thing that I agree, but should have limited impact in the next 100 years given the fact they are converting to high tech econ (internal) while having their chinese companies go overseas building factories for cheap labor which is the main source of the ""leaving china"".

That’s not how it works. The demographic bomb is a issue because older people are dependents. They don’t spend much, but they cost a lot.

Indonesia remains mostly Western aligned(especially among certain military elites), but with a bottom line of independent ""free and active"" posture.

For instance, Australia under its then labor government supported Indonesia independence from the Dutch even while both United States and Britain supported continued Dutch colonial rule. Though United States would come around and be instrumental to Indonesia's independence by threatening to cut of Netherlands's economic aid for post-WW2 rebuilding.

&gt; Despite all the posturing the Australians have done, they never actually clashed with the Chinese Navy / Coast Guard, not even once. Indonesia has. The US has.

Are we talking about low level clashes over fishery enforcement and patrols? United States is perhaps unusual since it sends long range surveillance and continuous patrols so it sometimes have naval clashes far from its shores. However, this is not unusual behaviour among SCS claimant states, Philippine clashes with Vietnam, Taiwan with South Korea, China with Vietnam, it is routine for Southeast Asia coast guards to have bad blood with each other. What examples are you citing here, in particular, since it is not unheard of for Australian and Chinese ships/planes to aggressively monitor each other, even using lasers to disrupt the other's operation, but the classical fishery/coast guard clashes are rare due to the geography of the Pacific while SCS/coast Pacific states have much more frequency frictions over fishery issues.

What did the [Indonesian Defense Ministry say about AUKUS?](https://www.thejakartapost.com/world/2021/11/23/prabowo-says-understands-respects-aukus-pact.html)

&gt;""Officially our position is that of course Southeast Asia should remain nuclear free, and the fear of course among Southeast Asian nations is that this will spark an arms race,"" he said. ""But as I said the emphasis of every country is to protect their national interest. If they feel threatened… they will do whatever they can to protect themselves,"" said Prabowo.  
  
This article was published in thejakartapost.com with the title ""Prabowo says 'understands, respects' AUKUS pact"".

Under normal situations, it's Military &gt; Foreign Ministry. With Prabowo in charge, it is even more so.  Prabowo is part of the Indonesian elite, he ran for President twice against the current President. What he says has far more weight than a statement by the Foreign Ministry.

Since 1955, the Indonesian Army has had poisoned relations with the PRC   In 1959, the Indonesian military tried to clear ethnic Chinese in rural areas in West Java to enforce a law nationalizing rural property of non-indigenous people (ie Arabs, Indian but mostly Chinese). The Chinese embassy intervenes, and Chinese diplomats even manned the barricades. It was the military that kept Indonesia's relations with China suspended from 1967 to 1990, even when the Foreign Ministry want to normalize relations in the 1970s.

To the Indonesian military Natuna is strategically important because it is located at the narrowest gap that connects the SCS to Indonesia's inner lake (ie the Java Sea). In the 14th century, the Majapahit Navy used to base a fleet there waiting for the Mongols to return after the invasion of Java in 1292.

The reality is the Indonesian posture both in terms of population and military assets has been shifting northward over the last 50 years, they even plan to move the capital northward.

Despite all the posturing the Australians have done, they never actually clashed with the Chinese Navy / Coast Guard, not even once. Indonesia has. The US has.

The Australians show fealty to the US, not because it's a US lapdog like most Chinese think, but because the US grants it the privilege to be sheriff in the Pacific. Australia is a neocolonial state, so that is why in many ways they are more aggressive toward China than even the US is.

Indonesia understands the nature of Australians, but as long as the US is in charge, they will restrain the worse impulse of the Australians. The Australians wanted a free West Papua in the 1960s, and in many circles in Australia, they still do.  The Indonesian got the US onboard with regards to Papua, but essentially bribing the Americans with Freeport and allowing Western missionaries (ie Americans) to operate in Papua. 

When the Australian Navy crossed into Indonesian water during the refugee crisis in 2014.[, the response of the Indonesian Navy was rather tepid.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/19/australian-vessels-unintentionally-entered-indonesian-waters-six-times) The reason is the Islands in which this occurred are the poorest region in Indonesia. The Australians would have to be nuts if they decided to annex it.

To your average native Indonesian, both the Chinese and the Westerners colonized them. The Chinese in Southeast Asia were the middlemen of the colonizers. They ran the opium trade and collected taxes for both the native and western rulers in 18-19th centuries.  China wouldn't have the influence in Southeast Asia today if it wasn't for the West.

Ukraine had 8 years to prepare for this obvious attack.

The corruption, lack of professionalism, and lack of belief in what they are doing are all parts of what is commonly called *rot* in the Russian military. To me it seems to be similar to the reason that the Soviet Union broke apart; the citizens and soldiers at high and low levels simply do not believe in the state. That is to say that they do not believe in the Russian Federation's purpose or trust in its institutions, including their own chain of command. 

For me this lack of buying in to the country and the military mission itself is a more significant factor for the performance of the Russian military in the war in Ukraine than bad initial planning or bad intelligence. Stumbles and mistakes can be corrected and not repeated, but the fact that the Russian military cannot get its act together to perform basic tasks even after almost 80 days of fighting is remarkable.

The Russian state has billions of dollars of oil money pouring in everyday, yet they are unwilling or unable to provide basic supplies or training to its soldiers. The fundraising by private individuals is admirable that they care for their countrymen, but the ad hoc nature is not conducive to properly equipping a force. And that the political leadership has not stepped up to provide what is needed is damning to their concern for their men and ability to react properly in a dynamic situation.

--------------------

&gt; * The Russian public sector has consistently ranked near the bottom of Transparency.org’s Corruption Perceptions Index, placing 136 out of 180 countries in 2021. 

&gt; * Tor Bukkvoll wrote in a 2005 study of corruption in the Russian armed forces that it included three elements. 

&gt; * The first was individual corruption, seen as an essential means of providing a minimal standard of living. 

&gt; * The second was institutional corruption, taken to mean the ‘web of informal rules, constraints and habits’ that governed the lives of Russian officers. 

&gt; * Finally, there was the political level, which included the relations between the Russian government, the military, and institutions established to police corruption.

&gt; * Notable cases of Russian corruption gained public attention throughout the 1990s, including the Russian general dismissed for selling UN fuel while deployed to Kosovo, and reports of Russian soldiers deployed to Chechnya selling their weapons to Chechen fighters. 

&gt; * The problem appears to have grown in scope, leading Russia’s chief military prosecutor Sergei Fridinsky to claim in 2011 that corruption through the abuse of state defence orders had taken on ‘cosmic’ proportions. 

&gt; * Body armour remains something of a luxury for some forces; China has only recently begun to introduce it into its ground forces on a large scale. Russian troops could be observed in Georgia without any body armour at all, while their opponents carried modern Western designs.

&gt; * However, there is evidence that vital elements of the Ratnik system did not reach their intended destination. The Ratnik body armour, known as 6B45, could be bought on Avito (Russia’s eBay) at a cost of $200–250. A full vest with a helmet could be bought for around $300, and a pair of plates for $100–150. ‘All those “Granite” plates that cost 10,000 roubles per pair – they were stolen from warehouses by ensigns and sold online’, wrote one blogger on 6 April.

&gt; * In 2008, a case was opened against the former head of the supply department of the Russian Ministry of Defence, Valery Znakhurko, who was charged with fraud and abuse of power over the procurement of body armour for the army. 

&gt; * This combined with reports of Russian soldiers going without food for three days seems indicative of the poor state of planning, but may also point to corruption.

&gt; * These reports combined suggest that the institutional and political corruption endemic in Russia may have resulted in suboptimal supplies to Russian troops, both in terms of quantity and quality. 

&gt; * Other forms of corruption in the Russian Army include the use of conscripts to conduct construction work; examples range from the personal homes of Russian officers to local construction projects. 

&gt; * …some Russian formations like the Airborne Troops appear to be well-trained, which is reflected in their frequent use. Perhaps the same is true of the artillery, which is relied upon by most of the armed forces to deliver lethal effects.

&gt; * Army units also receive only very basic personal medical kits, which have not changed since the 1960s. 

&gt; * Russia’s communication troubles have been evident in places throughout the war. This, too, may be a partial result of corruption…

&gt; * There is evidence that some Russian units are better motivated and equipped than others, indicating that corruption has not prevented those units from receiving the equipment necessary to perform their roles. This suggests that future analysis of the Russian military would be well-advised to include further research into the impacts of corruption upon equipment and training levels, so that a body of research can be used to inform assessments of Russian military capabilities.

And abandon Indonesia's since independence ""free and active"" foreign policy, why don't Australia join ASEAN instead and practice the Indonesian's way in a large pluralistic Southeast Asia organisation? Indonesia's neutral and non confrontational stance is much more than about trade with China since Indonesia long practiced it before the increased coupling with China and it served Indonesia well. Indonesia largely remains disinterested on matters that don't concern it, which includes the South China Sea outside portions that impact Indonesia(though that is changing given the renewed US-China competition in the region).

And ASEAN countries, individually and collectively, have very different view in regards to the Russia-Ukraine conflict compared to the West. And is Indonesia not right to be suspicious? It is not like Australia does have a history of using submarines as intelligence gather tools during the Cold War, targeted at Soviet Union, Vietnam, China, and yes, Indonesia, including a very daring attempt within Shanghai habour right inside China's own territorial waters(if not internal waters).

[],False,,Kvetch__22,,,[],,,,text,t2_wa50e,False,False,"I really think you're dressing up a very insidious ideology as ethical concerns. 

To suggest the US ever had a role in ""re-educating"" Russia in the 90s and 2000s is bizarre. Was the US supposed to set up democracy schools in Russia after the cold war? How is it that when we talk about Russia's backslide into a brutal autocracy, Russians have no agency in that outcome, but somehow the Americans do?

Ignoring the vital interests of powerful nations is a great way to generate conflict, I agree. But there are two problems with this. The first is that Russia is not a powerful nation. It has no soft-power capability at this point, limited military potential bolstered by a rapidly aging Soviet-Era stockpile, and its economy is a shell of the former USSR. It is a country mainly focused on exporting gas and importing Western technology and know-how, and those brain-drain problems have only accelerated with the political deterioration and demographic decline of the country. Secondly, Russia's demands are out of all proportion with their place in the world. What Putin has asked for, in terms of the rollback of NATO, amounts to nothing less than the imposition of Russian conquest onto million of people currently living in free democratic countries. And while the balance of global security should come into play, the global order also cannot acquiesce the claims of every mid-tier power, especially when they lay claim to an empire that would make Peter the Great blush. 

And again, we get to the fact that both ethics and international law, to which Russia is a party, recognize the right of national self-determination. Confrontation with the West was optional for Russia. And this is where I think you need to reconsider your system of thinking. Ukraine did not decide to invade Russia. What Russia is facing to day is a crisis of soft power. Through two decades of Putin's dictatorship, brutal wars, aggression, assassination, vote-rigging, political persecution, cultural repression, saber-rattling, and chest thumping, Putin has managed to reduce the geopolitical attractiveness of alliance with Moscow to zero for any halfway democratic state. The US did not cause this, and NATO is not responsible for the internal dysfunction of Russia. Moscow has failed to put together any sort of reasonable alternative to ""the West,"" to the point that even the Ukrainians decided they wanted out of Moscow's sphere. 

What you're talking about is a two part act. The first is the Russian-led implosion of Russia's sphere of influence, hemorrhaging money and allies as economic growth stalled and kleptocracy rose. The second is the Western reaction to that implosion, which has been to provide security guarantees to people worried that a poor and desperate Russia, unable to convince anyone of their own ability to provide, would turn to military force to subjugate their neighbors. That has turned out to be a well-founded fear, and it was Georgia before Ukraine that cemented it. This is the story of an empire that was lost through corruption and incompetence that Moscow is trying to restore by putting people to the sword. Talk all you want about American foreign policy, because there is no question the US made insane mistakes of a similar quality by invading Iraq, but the NATO-EU order has no responsibility to shove Eastern Europe under the bus because Russia only knows the kind of power that comes out of a long rifle. 

And as Russian shells, from Russian guns, fired by Russian soldiers, on the orders of Russian commanders, participating in an invasion instigated by Russian leadership land on Ukrainian civilians, it is reprehensible to me that your reaction is to say the United States is somehow responsible, as if they pulled the trigger themselves. The fact is that Vladimir Putin made a calculation that, in order to build with war what he couldn't build with peace, millions of people would need to die at the hands of his soldiers. To ask NATO to acquiesce to a worldview that permits that kind of mass death in order to enforce political orders on people who don't want them is to ask the world to discard every shred of humanitarian dignity that people have clawed for over the last 200 years. 

And as I have stated above, that kind of myopic thinking is not just ethically questionable, but wrong. The Soviets had many of the same problems and could never manage their sphere. They were forced to kill thousands of people in Eastern Europe in order to keep their people in power, and the Soviet sphere eventually fell apart only because the price in blood was not something the USSR was willing to pay anymore. If Ukraine shows us anything it is that free people will fight. The idea that the world would avoid war by allowing Russia to define its own sphere of influence is incredibly shortsighted; you're only signing up for more wars and more death in a dozen other ways, especially after the horrors the USSR inflicted on some of the people Russia now claims superiority over. Accusing the US and NATO of selfishness is the same kind of short sighted thinking that started this war in the first place: that entire nations are just chips to be bargained with, and that if only we concoct the right balance of these chips between the Great Powers of the world, we will achieve some kind of perpetual peace. 

And if you want to be a realist, I will give you this too: Russian desperation to re-assert their hard power capability in lieu of soft power is failing miserably. They could conquer all of Ukraine and occupy it for 100 years, and the only way they could dislodge the EU-facing Ukrainian nationalism they sought to extinguish would be a genocide. In 2014, with Yanukovych fleeing the country, Russia leadership  should have introspected and realized that Russia needs 25 years of reform, growth, and integration before they could assert enough soft power to make stuff like the EAEU possible The PRC understands this and does it well. But Putin choose maximal confrontation presumably because a soft-power Russia wouldn't be able to reclaim the empire in his lifetime, and now millions of people will die, and Russia will achieve nothing. I hope you consider who is pulling the trigger, and what options they had, before laying blame for the bloodshed at the feet of people who were a continent away.",a5896570c1d7e3874d6223f76a8005391586d78c,True,False,,,,,0,1652503136,,0,{},i8jj00m,False,t3_uoq4bh,False,True,t1_i8imlfb,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uoq4bh/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_13_2022/i8jj00m/,1652503149,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652474336.0,

Japan had 2 large cities get nuked, was that the end of Japan? Evidently no, far from it. Ukraine can get a lot of it's population killed and a couple of cities nuked and still continue the fight - as sanguine as it may sound. A lot of Ukrainian civilians are getting slaughtered daily anyway, a building getting hit by artillery and entombing 100 people barely makes the news anymore.    
Also, I believe many of these soviet cities built their metro systems deep underground specifically to serve as nuclear shelters. So that should drastically limit human casualties.

As for how NATO would respond: there are 2 aspects:

1. NATO could deploy ABM systems like THAAD forward to the border with Ukraine and declare they'll shoot down anything that looks like it could damage NATO territory, even if it's Russian. It's a proportional escalation, because Putin is not supposed to even touch NATO ground with his nuclear explosions, and now he wants to lob these things in NATO's general direction! Very irresponsible.    
This would effectively put parts of western Ukraine under a missile defense umbrella. And if the defense system ends up being successful at defending against nukes in a real world situation, it risks putting the credibility of limited nuclear use into question - definitely not something Putin wants to test.

2. NATO can also escalate by providing Ukraine with even more sophisticated equipment. That could include weapons which Ukraine could use to strike within Russian borders in earnest - if Russia decides it wants to nuke Ukraine, than all gloves are off and Ukraine might as well openly fight Russia on it's own land.",355830638ef1a9286b8cbdcdfd0389be3909547a,True,False,,,,,0,1652496893,,0,{},i8j833k,False,t3_uoq4bh,False,True,t1_i8illbt,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uoq4bh/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_13_2022/i8j833k/,1652496909,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652468093.0,

&gt; * But the use of intelligence by the United States and the United Kingdom as an instrument of state power in the run-up to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February is widely considered unprecedented.

&gt; * What makes it different now? First, intelligence studies scholar Mark Lowenthal notes, US governments have typically shared material after an event has taken place, rather than before.

&gt; * While some of this “prebunking” has helped shape the information environment, it also has the effect of generating suspicion and confusion within Russia’s intelligence services, increasing the level of paranoia about leaks and moles.

&gt; *  …US and UK officials alike believe they have created a new model for how intelligence can support geopolitical goals in an era of revived great-power competition.

&gt; * However, before we can see these developments as a new model to be emulated, caution and sober analysis of the downsides are also needed. 

&gt; * Most notably, if Putin had chosen not to engage in his military campaign in Ukraine, we would be having a very different conversation about the strategic use of intelligence for geopolitical ends. The US and UK intelligence communities continue to suffer reputational damage after the George W. Bush administration’s claims of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq (as well as numerous other more recent intelligence failures, such as the Afghanistan withdrawal).

&gt; * In addition, these activities involve a clear blurring of intelligence with information operations. Of course, all information operations are based on some kind of intelligence — but in this case intelligence is the operation itself, not merely what underpins it.

I've always found it interesting that when people talk about nuclear war, it's always MAD this, MAD that, even though MAD has literally never been anyone's doctrine. At most, we could say that the MAD theory influenced American and Soviet doctrine through roughly the 1970s. With modern sensors and MIRV warheads, one of the key planks of MAD - that decision-makers are compelled to use maximum force because of lack of knowledge of the scale and targeting of the enemy strike - is no longer true, and hasn't been for a long time. Today it's possible for all of the major nuclear powers to know, in some detail, the extent and general targeting of an enemy nuclear strike, and to prepare and launch a retaliatory strike before the first strike lands.

Such response may include establishing of no flight zones over Ukraine or entry of NATO Armed Forces into western Ukraine.  

I do agree there will be a tremendous pressure for a seize fire which freezes the conflict along the current lines.

I think there is another point to consider while Putin is in charge of Russian state he’s not the entirety of Russian state. There are many individuals and organizations whose cooperation he must secure in order to trigger use of nuclear weapons. Since by definition the nuclear weapon use would be in circumstance where overall progression of the war is appearing to go quite badly for Russia , it’s logical to assume that points of resistance will be forming within the Russian state apparatus. 

This does not necessarily represent people who are pro western but rather people whose lifestyle relies on living in a country with some intercourse with the west. It’s commonly said that the bargain that the Russian people have made with Putin is material comfort in exchange for giving up political power.  You have to consider the fact that this applies not only to Russia’s middle class, but also to Russian upper class, including people traditionally grouped as siloviki.

How does that help Ukraine though ? So .... great.... Russia now has maximal international sanctions applied against it. Thats in place.

But they still hold all that Ukranian land. Ukraine still hasn't got it back, Russia are sitting on it.

&gt;Well, in my scenario NATO would be effectively joining the war at least with air and missile strikes, again mostly restricted to Ukraine.

OK, so now Ukraine would have an easier time of it *if they decided to carry on driving into the nukes*.

Yes, I think its clear we'd have to make it so much more obviously painful for russia that everyone else can see using the nuke put them in a worse spot than not having done so, granted. We want to use sanctions/other things to make that obvious.

But let me try to produce the numbers and quick summaries of why.

First sources, I am often suprised how often people can't see blatant propaganda and seemingly unable to find the other sides news/propaganda. Its worth add weights to almost every news on trust worthines, but the idea is to try to ""feed"" from as many different source you can find (no echo chambers).

What some calculations shows that Russian losses (its hard to say if these are KIA or casulties, they seems to be used quite interchangably ... tabloid media, thank you) are above 20k now, maybe even 30 (It seemed below that before the river crossings, losses also seems to have tappered of a little after the initial fuck up, but now intensitiy seems getting up again, from the number of offensives. please also take everything I say with a 25% error rate)

Ukrainian casulties could be around 7-15k

Vehicle losses seems to be 1 ukraine for every 3 russians. (Mostly orxy data extrapolated, but seems valid from a commited defender vs a not so motivated attacker)

Why can't Russian attack succed? Of course we can't know that for sure, but their victory reports often been turned out to be false. Their gains are slow, but modern forces cannot hold trench lines against each other. Local artillery supremacy initially will break down defensive postions enough or make reinforcment/resupply/setting counter artillery fire impossible. Defenders usually abandone such positions (different fortifixations can be for quite a time if moral and supplies permit it, see Azovstal, honestly I am still suprised hey hold, expected them to be broken 3 weeks ago, they must have fortified that place since 2014) Point is, progress is expected. It is close to the slowest imaginable, being strong proof that defenders are organized and strong. Russians attack can succed if local supremecy is achieved) Ukraine seems to have resosted every critical break attempts (worst situation I think was Izuym maybe 2 weeks ago).

So short answer, because what we see.

Note on long range guided missles. They need to keep some ammount of supplies (i think less then many people think here, nukes get them a lot of wiggle room, so they dont really have to expect attack on russia itself), sonyeah they should be able to keep this up for quite some times ( ~ seceral months), but woth incomming western aid and sanctioned russian supplies, eventually they will run out of man and material faster.

https://thesovietarmourblog.blogspot.com/2017/12/t-72-part-2.html#water

A sample:

&gt; When the OPVT system is fully activated and the snorkel is mounted, fording up to a depth of 5 meters is possible, but thorough preparations are necessary in order to do so. The same preparations for crossing an 1.8 meter-deep stream must be followed, and the additional preparations include sealing the edges of all hatches and various openings and periscopes with a thick resinous waterproofing paste, as the water pressure at such depths is simply too much for rubber seals to handle. 

...

&gt; Crew members are each given a closed-circuit IP-5 rebreather and a life jacket. The crew must put on the life jacket before beginning the snorkeling operation as a precautionary measure, but the IP-5 may or may not need to be worn prior to entering water. In most cases, the rebreather is worn inside the tank when the commander gives the order to bail out of the tank while the tank is already underwater.

&gt; To cross water obstacles deeper than 1.8 meters, the snorkel included in the OPVT kit is needed to supply air to the engine as the entire tank would be submerged. The long telescoping snorkel, which is made from steel, is broken down into three sections for stowage. The total length of the assembled snorkel is 3,712mm.

&gt; ... The snorkel is fitted with two floating markers during training exercises to indicate the tank's position underwater to help rescue teams locate the tank if it has stopped underwater.

There is nothing great powers fear more than the use of nukes becoming acceptable. At that point there would be *global* interest in making sure Russia deeply regrets their decision.

My guess for *a* realistic scenario (similar to a proposal I remember reading from a Pentagon wargame of an attack on the Baltics) would be a *total* sanction regime, with massive conventional escalation limited to Ukraine and nearby bases, while threatening nuclear retaliation to any further strikes.

&gt;
&gt;It seems the USA and Australia are well aware of the existence of their own spheres of influence. You know, that bizarre 19th century stuff.

I think it's not so much the idea of spheres of interest so much as the military invasion that people see as a bizarre 19th century relic.

I assume that everyone agrees that is makes sense for Russia to be concerned about Ukraine growing closer Russia's traditional enemies. I assume that the US would be highly concerned in the hypothetical I always see getting tossed around where Mexico lets China build military bases next to California. Both of those are things that would be likely to create security issues.

The question is what you are able to do about it. Is hard power permissible, or are you restricted to soft power? A hundred years ago, the answer would have been sure, send the army in, the rest of the world will understand. Today, it's a much muddier picture. The last hundred years have meant that you're likely to face higher costs internationally, especially if this takes place in or near Europe, and my guess is that trend will continue and expand to cover more of the globe as time passes.

If Mexico gave China permission to build bases next to the border, it's unthinkable that those bases would actually get built. The US would either offer Mexico enough money, threaten enough trade restrictions, or some combination of both, to cancel the deal, and it would be successful. The US has the soft power it needs to avoid using hard power, so it doesn't face these tough choices. Largely China possesses this soft power too. Russia doesn't to the same extent, but their problems in Ukraine are also largely their own fault, because they killed off what soft power they had by invading Ukraine in 2014. That's what set them on the road to the tough choices they're facing today.",75687851f2f6e3342c160c01704424863cb8174a,True,False,,,,,0,1652489485,,0,{},i8itf7r,False,t3_uoq4bh,False,True,t1_i8ilc9r,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uoq4bh/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_13_2022/i8itf7r/,1652489496,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652460685.0,

In so far as he gets to keep Southern Ukraine, the Donbas, and anywhere else he has troops.... and in return we voluntarily take on the risk of ensuring he doesn't take more ?

Maybe. I can see that being a solution.

That won't stop the proliferation/rogue states though. We're not going to make everyone NATO members like this. If Iran wants to grab a big chunk of Iraq.... they can get a nuke, use the same Putin scheme, and then what ? We make Iraq a NATO member to stop it again ?

Its just unclear what that is, and its almost certainly not (in this scenario) a nuclear response.

A strategic nuke used against a NATO city ? Yes, there I can see a return single nuke used against a russian city in a tit-for-tat limited exchange.
