There is ambiguity being china is JUST ""representing"" by the PRC.

You also cant be independent without the UN rules to help you these days.....   

If you wish to invalidate all of the UN stuff then we can Kiss Taiwan bye bye. 


Your totally using the WRONG example.... NKorea and SKorea is also in Civil war, and for sure not sovereign by the UN. Just like Taiwan and China and they are for sure not sovereign.   hell SKoreans themselves dont consider themselves to be either, but they seem to be more logical knows more english and also inline with UN rules than anyone which brushes off anything UN. Of course they are being reconfigured by many ""western democratic"" countries as sovereign, but for sure they are are not legally. Just search for it (not on wiki)

UN may be a laughing stock, but it still holds large amounts of power IF one know HOW to use it.

You're correct, but i think you may be overestimating how involved the vast majority of countries want to get involved in this sort of thing.

Most of the planet is struggling enough as it is to keep their countries functioning and doesn't have either the financial latitude or diplomatic interest in things escalating at all. The CURRENT effects of the war and the sanctions are already making it so that various countries are genuinely at risk of mass humanitarian crises.

Even if the Russians are getting slammed by the Ukrainians, they are still setting up foundations for more unconventional methods of conflict against the West.

If the upcoming food crisis coincides with another crisis whether be war, locusts, drought, e.t.c. then it is assured that Europe will be facing another refugee crisis that will be internally politically divisive and cause instability in general. Historically refugees especially from war torn, poor countries have incurred a significant burden of their host’s tax base - which we can see is leading to far right support, this year’s French elections are a example of this effect.

Noureddine Adam, who led the charge on the Republic of Logone thing, leads a faction which is now part of the Coalition des Patriotes pour le Changement (CPC) (though as far as I can tell that doesn’t extend to actually co-governing territory with CPC affiliates). Since 2015 the dynamics have changed immensely – whereas the secessionist movement was at least ostensibly about Muslim separatism, there is now a lot of fighting in the area among the (Muslim) groups which supported it (among FPRC factions, and between the FPRC and the MLCJ). The CPC includes anti-balaka, and its aim seems to be control of the entire country (but who knows whether the plan is to split it amongst themselves once that’s achieved). That fits with [this interview](https://www.theafricareport.com/61745/car-rebel-chief-noureddine-adam-nothing-precludes-bozize-from-becoming-the-cpcs-leader/amp/) from last year – Adam’s priorities seem to have shifted away from secession. 

So my best guess is that the FPRC is still running a parallel quasi-state in the areas they still control, but there don’t seem to be any active secessionist ambitions.

The hypothesis of the naval blocade requires the ability that the Chinese navy would be able to beat the US navy or at least inflict it so much damage they would not dare intervene.

So that would also means, China would only start such an operation when they are strong enough to not care that much about the missiles.

Moreover, I must disagree with your main point of needing only an antinavy.

This is good for repulsing an invasion. But if the chinese are ready to use anti-ships missiles or subs, they can impose the naval blocade anyway.

That is not clear.  I do not support Russians, but from a geopolitical standpoint, much of this is about real estate in east Ukraine.  Most notably, Russia views Crimea the same way the U.S. views Oahu/Pearl Harbor.

Crimea is site of  the  Sevastopol naval base, which has a history that far predates Khrushchev *giving* Crimea to Ukraine in 1954. [See NPR article](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2014/02/27/283481587/crimea-a-gift-to-ukraine-becomes-a-political-flash-point).   (NPR probably regrets that wording today)

To steelman: the Ukrainian perspective: 2021: [Time to remind Russia that Crimea is Ukraine](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/time-to-remind-russia-that-crimea-is-ukraine/)

Russia knows Ukraine is lost to the West, and also likely Finland and maybe Norway.  Russia seeks permanent control of  1) Crimea, 2) the Kherson area, which has the canal bringing water to Crimea (FN) 3) the land bridge to Donbas and 4) most of Donbas (what it holds today).  Russia's severe losses on the battlefield preclude further expansion.  

This RealLifeLore video has a decent analysis on the geopolitics.  The first part is mostly irrelevant now; as it explains the rational for Russia to control all of Ukraine, but from 10 minutes on, the geopolitical value of Crimea and east Ukraine is discussed:  [Why Russia is Invading Ukraine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If61baWF4GE&amp;t=242s).

And I agree, China cannot build a high-confidence plan based on high-confidence in its units. But that's why spamming works great. If you tell 50k vessels to just...surround Taiwan, a bunch of them will have engine problems or go to the wrong spot. That doesn't matter. It's all about redundancy.

China's already engaged in this area denial around their atolls, where they'll have dozens of unarmed vessels that ram ""intruding"" foreign boats. For Taiwan it will even be easier - if a foreign vessel tries to run the blockade, they'll have to run over some (presumably unarmed) Chinese boats to do so. That kind of ""reckless"" behavior would justify the boarding of the vessel ""to prevent further reckless behavior"". No bloodshed required. 

The only viable counter move for the US would be to annihilate thousands of unarmed Chinese fishing boats - not only would they be shooting first, but they'd be ""escalating"" the conflict to a huge degree and slaughtering thousands of unarmed people. It's difficult to see that being a tenable approach. 

The other half of China's strategy is their own incredibly potent anti-ship capabilities, which they're going to great lengths to advertise. They've built mockups of US carriers and Aegis cruisers in the desert and blown them up with the world's only ballistic anti-ship missiles. 

That's designed to warn the Americans off. The defenses of a US carrier group are formidable, but they again don't have an answer for being spammed with anti-ship missiles. 

fwiw, I think we'll see a move vs Taiwan very soon. Putin is sitting in a holding pattern, which is against all Russian combat doctrine. The only way that makes sense is if he's waiting for something, and the most likely ""something"" is a PRC move against Taiwan.

Anyone who deals with the UN will have full knowledge of that, as would anyone in Taiwan trying to get UN acceptance to be its own sovereign state or sovereign country.

Of course we are talking about the politics and layman terms... the entire point of this discussion we are having is about the views within Taiwan and what changes under the status quo might be viewed as acceptable or unacceptable. Your last point was even that it was a ""translation error"", and that people in Taiwan understand the meaning of ""one country, two systems"" and would be okay with it... which I assure you is far from the reality on the ground here.

Also Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations, so the United Nations is somewhat irrelevant to this discussion. If you are going to claim some ""legal language"" within the United Nations is relevant, at least please provide the quote, a citation, or source... because the UN has thousands and thousands and thousands of lines of ""legal language"", and each one applies to each individual member state or non-member state differently.

----
&gt;BUT you cant be sovereign with overlapping claims of the entire whole country, which nulls your entire argument. But that also goes the same way against PRC..... sooo Currently there is NO sovereign country of China, nor sovereign state of china.

Of course you can... both North and South Korea are currently two sovereign independent countries that claim each others territory... also how are you even defining ROC's territorial claims? ROC's territorial claims are purposely left ambiguous, while their effective jurisdiction and control is well-defined.

""China"" is the colloquial term for a sovereign country officially called the People's Republic of China, while ""Taiwan"" is the colloquial term for a country officially called the Republic of China. Taiwan and China are two sovereign independent countries, officially as the Republic of China and People's Republic of China respectively. This is how we overwhelmingly view the status quo, at least in Taiwan.

----
&gt;Given China and Taiwan is technically in Civil war in the eyes of the UN, there is a state of China due to a slight a fudging of ambiguity on UN side. There is a country of China (mainland China ruled by PRC) and a country of China (Taiwan ruled by RoC).

Show me where within the United Nations, the United Nations claims China is currently going through a period of civil war. At the United Nations, there is China which is represented by the PRC. There is no ambiguity here, Taiwan/ROC is not a UN member so there is no country of China ruled by the ROC.

The United Nations itself does not recognize countries, nor does it/can it decide who is and isn't a country.

----
&gt;ALSO if your ""really"" from Taiwan please read your damn constitution. RoC never claimed Independence being the constitution is claiming they are China.... in the end what is needed is that the RoC needs to vote to get rid of their constitution and all claims of China to even go the Independence route, so no taiwan was never independent at all. RoC own constitution is preventing it.. you can thank Chiang Kai-shek, your founder for that.

Nowhere does the ROC Constitution claim to be ""China""... it claims to be the ""Republic of China"". The term China (again, 中國) does not appear anywhere within Constitutional Law.

Also the ROC Constitution does not define it's territorial claims.

At least to the extent that Russia has basically always stated obliquely or directly that the use of Nukes is justified if the security of the Russian state is in play. 

The Ukrainian army is not a threat to the Russian state, but NATO as a whole is. The threat of nukes is therefore directed at NATO, not Ukraine. Although Ukrainians would be the first vicitims of course.

Seems to me more likely that by annexing Donbass, Putin could easier resort to mobilisation if Ukraine launches serious counter-offensives. If Russia mobilises, Ukraine loses their manpower advantage. Those mobilised Russians might not be as trained as their professionals fighting now, but Russia would have the advantage of being on the defensive. This makes it very unlikely that Ukraine could actually push the Russians al the way back to Russia. At least, we're talking years of preparation and training on the Ukrainian side.

We have Ukrainian helicopters raining missiles on Belgorod, but the stroke of a pen is going to magically turn Mariupol into Russian soil upon which no Ukrainian boot can tread under pain of nuclear fire?  Seems unlikely.

The problem that nuclear weapons pose for Russia is that they are not totally isolated, yet.  Sanctions could get much, much worse.  Germany could stop buying gas.  India could stop buying weapons.  It's even reasonable to question if China would support Russia in breaching the nuclear taboo --their support for that other isolated client state is not always unbounded.

Which is all to say that it isn't just what Russia thinks about the ""realness"" of any such annexation -it's the international perception that matters when it comes to actually freeing Russia's nuclear hand.

That said, Russia has been making outlandish threats this whole war, in a desperate bid to shape Ukrainian and western behavior.  This is certainly not *less* likely to work than their threats at Finland.  Makes sense they'll try it.

The real goal for the west is for the war to end quickly. As you pointed out, despite the narrative spread in the West (ans on reddit) that Ukraine is winning, the fact is even though Russia is breaking its teeth, they are still bitting hard and succeeding at being disruptive. And the Russian population is very unlikely to stand up to a crazed Putin. 

Ukraine’s grain and araw material exports were part of a virtuous cycle of global stability. Not only does loosing this large global suppy in a war disrupts primary and secundary markets, but it also creates a viscious cycle that threatens western stability as the war drags on.

A simple example of this is the grain. Most of the grain used in humanitarian opperations for the UN’s WFP came from Ukraine. FAO’s report from the 8 march 2022 pointed out that the ukraine conflict might lead to +13 million additional people worldwide suffering from malnutrition in 2023. Combined with global food prices increasing, this might lead to serious insability in poorer middle eastern or african countries, leading to increased refugee flows, which will aim for European countries where far-right parties will garner support in the face of another wave of refugees. 

The west will push for a quick end to the war, so it may help ukraine back in the global market, thus slowing global price increases. This may require a negotiated peace though, as a total victory for Ukraine is unlikely, at least in the short term. This is also my guess as to why Macron has been pushing for a negotiated deal.",4c63f1812a62960d609690ba6e02f13c2c46a41f,True,False,,,,,0,1652504680,,0,{},i8jldzr,False,t3_uotw8w,False,True,t1_i8gyz84,/r/geopolitics/comments/uotw8w/no_marshall_plan_for_ukraine_geography_and/i8jldzr/,1652504693,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1652475880.0
