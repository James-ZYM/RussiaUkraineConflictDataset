In his weekend speech in Warsaw, President Joe Biden promised to help “Europe end its dependence on Russian fossil fuels” – including moving “as quickly as possible to clean, renewable energy”. He added:

“… the days of any nation being subject to the whims of a tyrant for its energy needs are over. They must end.”

But Biden perhaps did not anticipate how correct he might actually be: because the war in Ukraine is Putin’s trump card, a last-ditch effort to forestall the unwinding of the age of fossil fuels using military power. As such, I conclude, Putin’s strategy was never about winning a quick, decisive victory in Ukraine. Rather, he wanted to prepare the ground to be capable of creating a state of permanent instability in Europe that he can deploy as a lever to keep oil prices high in a bid to make Russia’s last oil frontier in Siberia economically feasible. This ploy has now been tested in Ukraine – and may be deployed again when deemed necessary as Russia’s fossil fuel economy dips further into crisis in coming years.

Facts on the ground have already complicated this strategy: what happens next hinges on whether Putin recognises that his war will accelerate the very economic obsolescence he wanted to forestall.",2e2c3a219975e4d4e98df73c2dc9e58dd42da961,True,False,,,,,0,1648667473,,0,{},i2r2mi5,True,t3_tsdxko,False,False,t3_tsdxko,/r/geopolitics/comments/tsdxko/weak_oil_the_looming_collapse_of_putins_petro/i2r2mi5/,1648667490,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648638673.0

[The Economist disagrees.](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/03/30/under-unprecedented-sanctions-how-is-the-russian-economy-faring)

&gt;The chaos in Russian markets seems to have subsided. Since its low in early March the rouble has jumped, and is now approaching its pre-war level (see chart 1). The main benchmark of Russian stocks plunged by a third, but has since recovered a chunk of its losses. The government and most firms are making payments on foreign-currency bonds. A run on banks that saw nearly 3trn roubles ($31bn) withdrawn came to an end, with Russians returning much of the cash to their accounts.

&gt;A battery of policies has helped stabilise the markets. Some are orthodox. The central bank has raised interest rates from 9.5% to 20%, encouraging people to hold interest-bearing Russian assets. Other policies are less conventional. The government has decreed that exporters must convert 80% of their foreign-exchange proceeds into roubles. Trading on the Moscow stock exchange has become, to use the central bank’s euphemism, “negotiated”. Short-selling is banned, and non-residents cannot offload stocks until April 1st.

&gt;The real economy, though, is in some ways the mirror image of the financial one: healthier than it seems at first glance. A weekly measure of consumer prices shows that they have risen by more than 5% since the beginning of March alone. Many foreign firms have pulled out, cutting the supply of goods, while a weaker currency and sanctions have made imports more expensive. But not everything is surging in price. Vodka, largely produced domestically, costs only a bit more than it did before the war. Petrol costs about the same. And though it is early days, there is little evidence yet of a big hit to economic activity.

&gt;According to an estimate using internet-search data produced by the OECD, a rich-country think-tank, Russia’s GDP in the week to March 26th was about 5% higher than the year before (see chart 2). Other “real-time” data gathered by The Economist, such as electricity consumption and railway loadings of goods, are holding up. A spending tracker produced by Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender, is slightly up year on year. Part of this reflects people stockpiling goods before prices rise: spending on home appliances is especially strong. But spending on services has fallen only a bit, and remains far healthier than it was during much of the pandemic.

&gt;Russia still seems sure to enter a recession this year. But whether it ends up faring as badly as most economists predict—the wonks are pencilling in a GDP decline of 10-15%—depends on three factors. The first is whether ordinary Russians start worrying about the economy as the war drags on, and reduce spending—as happened in 2014, when Russia invaded Crimea. The second is whether production eventually grinds to a halt as sanctions block firms’ access to imports from the West. Russia’s aviation sector looks particularly vulnerable, as does the car industry. Yet many big businesses that started during Soviet times are used to operating without imports. If any economy could come close to coping with being cut off from the world, it would be Russia’s.

&gt;The third and most important factor relates to Russia’s fossil-fuel exports. Despite the sheer number of sanctions imposed on it, Russia is still selling about $10bn-worth of oil a month to foreign buyers, equivalent to a quarter of its pre-war exports; revenues from the sale of natural gas and other petroleum products are still flowing in, too. This provides a valuable source of foreign currency with which it can buy some consumer goods and parts from neutral or friendly countries. Unless that changes, the Russian economy may stumble on for some time yet.",23119bb7304118655e6497570ae331f605906575,True,False,,,,,0,1648666624,,0,{},i2r0gxw,False,t3_ts81mc,False,True,t1_i2qrocb,/r/geopolitics/comments/ts81mc/the_perilous_long_game_in_ukraine_compromising/i2r0gxw/,1648666644,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648637824.0

[],False,,LongevityMan,,,[],,,,text,t2_r0hw4,False,False,"New article out in the New York Times by Bret Stephens named ""What if Putin Didn’t Miscalculate?"" The following are some cuts from the article. 


The conventional wisdom is that Vladimir Putin catastrophically miscalculated. He thought Russian-speaking Ukrainians would welcome his troops. They didn’t. He thought he’d swiftly depose Volodymyr Zelensky’s government. He hasn’t. He thought he’d divide NATO. He’s united it. He thought he had sanction-proofed his economy. He’s wrecked it. He thought the Chinese would help him out. They’re hedging their bets.


Putin’s miscalculations raise questions about his strategic judgment and mental state. Who, if anyone, is advising him? Has he lost contact with reality? Is he physically unwell? Mentally? 


The conventional wisdom is entirely plausible. It has the benefit of vindicating the West’s strategy of supporting Ukraine defensively. And it tends toward the conclusion that the best outcome is one in which Putin finds some face-saving exit: additional Ukrainian territory, a Ukrainian pledge of neutrality, a lifting of some of the sanctions. But what if the conventional wisdom is wrong? What if the West is only playing into Putin’s hands once again?


“There is a whole next stage to the Putin playbook, which is well known to the Chechens,” Gall writes. “As Russian troops gained control on the ground in Chechnya, they crushed any further dissent with arrests and filtration camps and by turning and empowering local protégés and collaborators.”


Suppose for a moment that Putin never intended to conquer all of Ukraine: that, from the beginning, his real targets were the energy riches of Ukraine’s east, which contain Europe’s second-largest known reserves of natural gas (after Norway’s). Combine that with Russia’s previous territorial seizures in Crimea (which has huge offshore energy fields) and the eastern provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk (which contain part of an enormous shale-gas field), as well as Putin’s bid to control most or all of Ukraine’s coastline, and the shape of Putin’s ambitions become clear. He’s less interested in reuniting the Russian-speaking world than he is in securing Russia’s energy dominance.


“Under the guise of an invasion, Putin is executing an enormous heist,” said Canadian energy expert David Knight Legg. As for what’s left of a mostly landlocked Ukraine, it will likely become a welfare case for the West, which will help pick up the tab for resettling Ukraine’s refugees to new homes outside of Russian control. 



If this analysis is right, then Putin doesn’t seem like the miscalculating loser his critics make him out to be. This alternative analysis of Putin’s performance could be wrong. Then again, in war, politics and life, it’s always wiser to treat your adversary as a canny fox, not a crazy fool. --- End cut from article ---

1.) Historically, appeasing expansionist dictators doesn't work. They take their concessions, wait for the short history of democracies to take effect, then once again demand more.   


2.) Putin's goal is to rebuild the USSR into a Eurasian hegemony; likewise Russia's empire has historically been an expansionist state for centuries, going all the way back to the era of Ivan the Terrible and Kievan Rus'; this is reality of being ""rich"" in territory, but ""poor"" in population and geographic barriers. Russia was able to expand to the Pacific/Siberia centuries ago, and into the arctic, but to the South and especially the West they are still somewhat open. The USSR's invasion of Afghanistan was a good indicator of how important buffer space is, to the point of starting a land war in the Graveyard of Empires.

3.) Allowing Russia to subsume Ukraine simply put them in a much more powerful position long term, shoring up food, fuel, manufacturing, and adding 40+ million (initially pissed off and dissenting) citizens to their crumbling demographics. Likewise, it gives more leverage over bending the EU to their will economically. 

4.) Allowing Putin a cheap ""win"" other than a long drawn out and costly ""victory"" simply shores up his domestic approval as well, and shows global authoritarians that the contemporary liberal world order has no stomach to actually push back against invading nation states.

The notion that Russia can just be given crumbs to keep this from blowing up into a wider conflict is unrealistic. Russia has invaded Ukraine, and Russia is on the edge of complete decoupling from the US &amp; Europe. The idea that Russia can be restrained through economic integration - which Germany is now getting lambasted for, by the way - has failed. Any off-ramp which is not conceding to Putin has been rejected. Precedent has been set, and incentives for Russia to de-escalate are reduced. What makes you think it will work now?

""Policymakers in Washington must wrestle with two distinct kinds of goals. In the near term, U.S. priorities remain denying Putin a battlefield victory, avoiding the escalation of the conflict, and limiting its humanitarian and economic costs. Over the long term, the United States wants to shape Russian behavior in such a way that minimizes risks to U.S. geopolitical interests and international stability and reduces the potential for future regional conflict.

The main challenge today is that Ukraine’s brave resistance—even combined with ever-greater Western pressure on Moscow—is highly unlikely to overcome Russia’s military advantages, let alone topple Putin. Without some kind of deal with the Kremlin, the best outcome is probably a long, arduous war that Russia is likely to win anyway. And such a protracted conflict would cement the current extreme level of hostility between Russia and the West, undermining long-term U.S. interests in regional and global stability.  
It will be extremely hard, if not impossible, for the United States to achieve either its short- or long-term objectives if the war drags on for months longer. However distasteful it may be to reach a compromise with Putin after the carnage he has unleashed, the United States should work to secure a negotiated settlement to the conflict sooner rather than later.""

Seems pretty simple to me. Iraq was essentially a continuation of the first gulf war, and probably mostly about a perceived need to ensure stable oil supply from around the Persian gulf. Saddam Hussein was unstable, and it's entirely possible the US decision makers genuinely believed he was building WMDs. It was definitely not out of character. 

Remember that a third of the worlds oil passes through the strait of Hormuz. If the whole region is plunged into war, tens or even hundreds of millions could die of starvation, and it'd trigger more wars/insurrections globally. We can't feed the world without oil. 

But to the US decision makers, it's also all about those juicy oil profits of course.

I feel like everyone was talking about how the Iraq war was really about oil back in the day. How has this been forgotten? It's not a good justification, but to me it's easy to see why the US wanted to do it. 

Afghanistan is even easier. I mean yeah, what you're saying would probably be better, definitely cheaper. But I don't think the US population would be satisfied with ""yeah, we're doing something in secret, maybe we'll capture Bin Laden eventually""

&gt;	Furthermore, recent declassified documents have shown that the nation most connectef to 9/11 was actually Saudi Arabia.

Ehh.. I mean, the connection to Saudi Arabia was always clear, but I haven't read anything yet that the Saudi leadership knowingly supported it.

And it's not like attacking Saudi Arabia was ever even an option. Again, because of oil.

[],False,,Drachos,,,[],,,,text,t2_d2rf0,False,False,"So warning this will be a long one. The mostly historic stuff will be divided from the more recent stuff by a line of X, then a second division will deal with the current government of India.

tl;dr: Due to a bunch of historic and modern geopolitical factors, the current Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, would look really bad surrendering his non-alignment stance as its based on FAR MORE then just 'We can't afford to do this.'

So historically speaking India was one of the few nations that could equal China in its power. It was rare that it did so as uniting so much land and so many people is very difficult, but powerful Indian States and Alliances between Indian states had historically great influence.

The two most obvious examples being that the Indians under the Delhi Sultanate defeating the Mongols and the latter Mughal Empire being that wealthy and powerful Europe literally didn't know what to give them in exchange for the Indian goods they desired.

I don't have the knowledge to discuss India's eventual 'conquest' by the British as its a complex topic but suffice to say, the process led to this once incredibly powerful and wealthy nation becoming an extraction colony.

This, combined with the World Wars, combined with the disastrous division of India during the independence process that not only led to millions dead but the current Kashmir border dispute has led to the Mindset India had going into the Cold War.

Namely that foreign powers would use India for their own gain and when India was no longer useful said foreign powers would leave India in a worse shape then when they showed up.

This led to India (along with Yugoslavia) choosing to remain Independent in the Korean war and then India, Yugoslavia and Eygpt founding the Non-Alignment movement which was at the time often referred to as the 3rd world (with the First World being those that sided with the US, and the Second World being those aligned with the USSR).

It is not unreasonable to say the First world took this situation worse then the Second world did. Mainly for Trade reasons as the nature of Communism meant that internal trade was limited and the First World really didn't want to trade to much with the Second world.

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

While all this is going on AND into the post Cold War era their have been 4 wars between India and Pakistan, in 1947, 1965, 1971 and 1999, as well as several minor border flair ups.

Excluding the 1999 conflict the US has publicly has supported Pakistan or remained neutral every time. This is due to Pakistan's allignment with the US during the Cold War being so critical as the only Central Asian Nations aligned with the First World. Pakistan's position was more important to the US then the actions of its leader.

(Technically speaking in 1971 the US sided with India/and Myanmar (at the time East Pakistan), HOWEVER this was top secret information until 2020 by which point its release did not effect geopolitics)

So despite the fact that India and the US were 'Neutral' for most of the Cold War, to Indian politicians and the India public it doesn't feel like it. The US felt like an outside force that considered India an inconvenience.

Of course with the rise of China in the 2000s India now has a problem on its border. And Pakistan is slowly moving into the Chinese Sphere of Influence, meaning India could face a two fronted war which it REALLY doesn't want. Thus it has been moving closer to the US and is one of the foundational members of ""The QUAD"" (An anti China pact between the US, Japan, Australia and India).

Thing is, its been clear from the start (It was originally formed in 2006 although it really only became an actual thing in the 2020s) that this arrangement is ONLY to do with China.

Formally the US still is an ally of Pakistan. HOW this Alliance is maintained given both Pakistan's growing closeness with China and how much the US has violated Pakistani sovereignty since 9/11, I can't really explain. But technically its still on the books.

In addition to all this is the Afghanistan conflict. India on multiple occations had tried to communicate with the US on that conflict, before, during and as it was closing up and as far is as publicly known the US essentially ignored the issue.

This has led to Refugees in India AND after the US pulled out leaving a bunch of equipment behind, has armed pro-Pakistani terrorists. 

This feeds into the narrative that again the West is arriving in Asia, ignoring India, then leaving, causing problems for India in the process, and that the QUAD ultimately is an alliance based ONLY on the fight againest China and the US doesn't care about India outside this situation.

(Not saying this is true, just that its a political narrative that both history and this action both feed)

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

Finally I have to make a note about the current Indian Prime Minister. Narendra Modi is a right wing Hindu nationalist. While this has A LOT of problems in many regards, one of his selling points is that India is ready to take its place as an equal on the world stage to the US, the EU, Russia and China. This idea sells VERY WELL to the public regardless of what has actually happened in India over the past 7 years (Ecconomic backsliding).

However as part of this belief, the Indian Public, the Indian government and the Indian PM all expect to be treated as equals by the US and the west. The West by contrast is used to (in one form or another) 2 centuries of being the top dogs of the world. They are REALLY bad at treating Asian powers as equals.

Thus DESPITE THE FACT India is again choosing a non-alignment path, and has voted against all votes in the UN about the Ukraine Conflict (both those tabled by the US and those tabled by Russia) the West only reports on the fact that India refuses to get in line.

This aggravates the Indian Parliament and Indian public who think that as an equal they should never be told or expected to 'get in line.' Especially since China doesn't get attacked in the same way for actively supporting Russia.

Modi uses these feelings to maintain a high (80%+) approval rating despite the growing problems in his country, but in the event the West DID provide him with Aid in return for Sanctions he would be forced to refuse.

History says this is a trick that will inevitably damage India in the long run and India is better off staying out of it.

For example the USSR saying, ""What we are doing to our minorities isn't bad. Look at what the US does to Black people"" is a classic example of Whataboutism.

Both things are bad and both thing should be seen as bad.

The thing is, whataboutism is one country justifying its actions by talking about something another country did.

This is not the same as a third party country looking at those actions and going, ""You are both bloody hypocrites, my people are starving and dying because of you, I am staying out of this.""

You say Saddam was a terrible leader....yet their are terrible leaders all through out Asia and Africa that are just as bad IF NOT WORSE then Saddam Hussain. The US didn't replace him because he was a bad person and EVERYONE knows it.

They replaced him for complex geopolitical reasons and they used 9/11 and false reports about WMDs to justify it.

Now you may say, ""Well yes but because Hussain was a bad person and Zeleskyy is a good person that justifies it.""

But thats REALLY easy to say when you aren't experiencing the ramifications of those actions.

Case in point... the US left weapons when it fled Afghanistan and those weapons are now being used againest Indians by Pakisatan and Afghanistan sponcered terror groups.

Now the US and its supporters claims, ""Any weapons we took would be a human we left behind. Would you rather us save weapons or lives."" And thats a fair arguement.

India's perspective however is, ""Because you saved those Afghans my people now die. And a single crate of weapons left behind will kill way more Indians then the number of Afghans you saved.""

The US perspective isn't wrong... it was good we saved those people. However that doesn't mean India is wrong either. Its people are dying and THAT is their main concern.

Your article says there were ~4000 Afghan civilian casualties over over 5 years, of which roughly 50% were caused by international forces. Comprehensive Figures in Ukraine are effectively impossible to get right now, but Mariupol(a single city) authorities guessed 2300 on 3/20.

Nothing in your article contradicts what I said. Your article says that 10 journalists were killed in the United States between 1981 and 1996, by multiple sources including Hatian military supporters and Tong criminal associations. Nowhere is it alleged the US government was involved in any of them. 
Information within Ukraine is hard to get, but Reporters without Borders had it at 15 journalists on 3/25. Russia's reputation for dead journalists is probably the worst in in the world, with estimates of murders from 1990 going into the hundreds, many of which are believed to be linked to the Kremlin.

[],False,,Wanghaoping99,,,[],,,,text,t2_t6g13xr,False,False,"The answer is quite unclear. To be sure, all-out war between the countries is quite unlikely, but in this day and age proxy wars are super common. We could very well have soldiers on either side presently stationed in Syria come into combat with each other, which could be problematic. Killing one of the Syrian militamen is not too big of a deal, it's a risk every country accepts, and besides they don't directly lose from that. But getting an actual serviceman killed can have dire consequences because killing a legal citizen of another belligerent forces the other side to respond firmly.  This might be exacerbated if the populace starts treating the casualties are martyrs and starts calling for vengeance.  And with all the belligerents importing some serious firepower into Syria, even a localised conflict could still be very destructive.  Especially when the Americans are involved.  Because of this intense murkiness on the ground, to avoid conflict, it seems that most of the major powers have acquiesced to a more cautious sphere of influence style arrangement. These rebel factions may not be the backers themselves, but if they get attacked their sponsors will likely enter the fray as necessary to protect them, which could lead to conflict. We have already seen this type of situation several times, when Turkey shot down a Russian warplane and during the Idlib offensive when Russian-backed Syrian forces engaged Turkish observation posts. It was only with great carefulness and substantial negotiation that the conflict did not escalate in a series of tit-for-tat attacks. Hence I think the major players will want to minimise even the chance of a military confrontation between state powers in Syria, which the whole proxy war thing was specifically meant to avoid. 

Right, regarding the insurgents, one of the most overt groups is PJAK. They have been an ever present threat to the Iranian state, though not at the level that would actually undermine Iran's control.  Nonetheless they damage Iranian infrastructure and weaken Tehran's hold over the outlying regions, so need to be eliminated. PJAK has a known partnership with the PKK. And like the PKK, PJAK has been alleged to operate across the border in Iraqi Kurdistan as a safe haven for their operations. Moreover, the close relationships suggests PJAK routinely traverses Iran's borders to liaise with other Kurdish militias. All of this contribute to suggest that Iran's western borders are quite porous and accommodate a lot more insurrectionary foot traffic than Iran would like. It is here that militants can exploit the fluidity to gain resources and seek refuge against the Iranians, perpetuating their struggle. In recent years, we have seen other potential troublemakers use the same boundaries for their own ends. ISIL for instance launched a brutal attack on the Iranian Parliament and war memorials using the same trick. With their ability to blend into the population, having  jihadists be able to easily cross the border became a major problem. There are also more speculative threats, such as those from Azerbaijan's irredentists who have continuously advocated for a conquest of Iran's Turkic regions to ""unify"" Azerbaijan. Hence Iran's border is a tense place where security may be at risk. 

What I mean by subterfuge is that Iran will likely try to use local proxies to increase their hold. Since Russia ordered a pause on offensive action after the latest Idlib advances, likely after Erdogan approached Putin, they have not approved any support for Bashar to attack further, although even now intense shelling is still going on at the frontline. Without Russian firepower the Syrians could not continue even if they wanted to, and the Iranians were unwilling to go ahead without Russian support even if they were more vocal about getting Assad back in control of the entire country. Iran had previously overseen actions against other rebel pockets, where they had experience with usage of negotiations to further their aims, particularly in the evacuation deals.  If Iran were unhappy with the status quo, they might try to gain control over the rebel groups through non-violent means to avoid the expenses of war. They could recruit agents to infiltrate the rebel groups, or make deals with them to supply certain commodities that could be scarce in the besieged Idlib Governorate.  These sort of cloak-and-dagger operation will likely be predominant in swaying over the local rebels. They might even dangle the possibility of ""reconciliation"" to tempt the fighters with a safe return to their homes in exchange for disarmament. However, any such efforts would be uncommon and unlikely to succeed, since the other belligerents would also be employing intelligence and counterintelligence operatives precisely to curb such a ploy.  So while Iran might use the subterfuge play I doubt it would be effective or feasible in most cases.",eccd0acc64ab8fefa27a97652b4db243271d5b29,True,False,,,,,0,1648609799,,0,{},i2o4o3v,False,t3_t8r8pz,False,True,t1_hzxog9d,/r/geopolitics/comments/t8r8pz/what_are_the_geopolitical_implications_of_a/i2o4o3v/,1648609813,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648580999.0

Foreign investment in Russia will resume (on worse terms for Russia) due to the sheer profit to be had. Social Media is utterly irrelevant when hard cash is at play. 

It is instructive that the US continues business with China and with Saudi Arabia in spite of the atrocious human rights records of both countries. Social Media only moves things when vested interests increase the volume of the noise. The Black Lives Matter trend in the US is a good case study.

Vietnam was like a handbraked war. To my knowledge, they never occupied the North to not have a repeat of Korea.
