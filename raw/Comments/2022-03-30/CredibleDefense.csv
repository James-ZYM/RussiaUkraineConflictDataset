[],False,,FriedrichvdPfalz,,,[],,,,text,t2_ghbt7t5,False,False,"This will be a very brief and incomplete overview over some of the social movements, political strategies and general factors that influenced German politics to arrive at the point where it stood up until January 2022. This is by no means a full accounting, I'd just like to give some pointers on where this German policy came from.

An obvious starting point, as with most issues concerning modern politics, was WWII and its end. Germany both inflicted incredible destruction and genocides and suffered total destruction in the later years. Especially the allied work towards denazification, which included confronting citizens with the committed genocides and the overwhelming guilt of everyone, since the third Reich war machine required participation from everyone. On of the longest lasting echos of this era that is often overlooked is that for many Germans, a general appetite for even offensive foreign policy soured. Both this initial confrontation as well as the German '68 student movement, which went even further in demanding denazification of public services, companies and civil societies created a strong undercurrent of anti-militarism in general. Add onto this the mandatory conscription, which lasted from 1956-2011, and there was always a strong, if not broad undercurrent that was vehemently pacifist.

From the political angle, the partition of Germany was seen as a great tragedy to be remedied at nearly any cost. This of course required a closer collaboration, mainly espoused by chancellor Brandt with his Ostpolitik. This was an incredibly successful policy that saw Germany supporting the West in general but actively reaching out to and connecting with Eastern European countries, especially the GDR. It also implanted the concept of a Germany as a connecting link between East and West in the collective public consciousness. This of course also shifted the way German citizens saw Soviet nations in general. The great enemy of NATO could be pacified through talks and treaties to such a degree that eventually, the GDR was abolished peacefully. I cannot overstate how deeply important this historical event was for all Germans. 

Keeping these factors in mind, after reunification there was a German population from both the Eastern and Western blocks, both of whom saw the horrors of the second World War as a responsibility to stay away from armed conflict anywhere and mostly minimise Germanys international influence except for treaties, deals and discussions, clearly tools of magnificent capacity. 

So, strong presistent pacifist undercurrent, a recent historical experience of immense success through talks and treaties with the great enemy and the overarching desire to stay away from any form offensive foreign policy led to a population and political class that was quite content with earning money and staying away from any conflict.",3c126aeb8f981cce5003c7d03caff75ddc57a6dd,True,False,,,,,0,1648684504,,0,{},i2s79kf,False,t3_ts8y5e,False,True,t1_i2rviq6,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ts8y5e/ukraine_megathread_march_30/i2s79kf/,1648684521,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648655704.0,

No. Total defense spending by nato member states was about $1.2T. The US accounted for about $800B of that. 

&gt;Where does this rhetoric come from that NATO is some type of charitable organization that doesn't need members to pay a fair share?

That comes from the fact that we don't ""Pay into NATO"". We commit to a level of defense spending for our own national interests, and together the treaty binds together these national interests in *certain circumstances*.

Mostly, Yes.

in regards to your comment on Taiwan, if the SOLE goal is to make the PLAN stronger then the NDRC would be spending all this money in Africa on a trans-Siberia pipeline. China would also be ramping up oil storage and transportation including pushing strategic reserves at all cost. 

The reason why China isn't doing that is that Taiwan is a reactive issue, not a proactive issue. China isn't planning to conquer Taiwan the moment it could. China could for a while now. The US military was exhausted and tired during the last 2 decades of occupation in the ME and Afghan. It doesn't mean Taiwan isn't a core issue, but just that it is not an immediate core issue.

From the publication:

*Key Takeaways March 25-29*  
  
*The Kremlin is falsely presenting its partial withdrawal of Russian forces from Kyiv and Chernihiv as a major Russian concession in service of peace talks with Ukraine. In reality, Russian forces are withdrawing to recuperate after suffering severe losses in their failed operations to seize those cities.*  
*Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko continues to withstand Russian pressure to enter the war in Ukraine on Russia’s behalf.*  
*The Kremlin is intensifying its internal censorship and crackdown on entities in Russia that do not cover the war in the Kremlin’s preferred terms.*   
*The Kremlin denied reports of increased conscription on March 26 but is likely beginning a broader mobilization that will coincide with Russia’s annual spring conscription on April 1. These new conscription drives are unlikely to generate effective Russian combat power for many months, at the earliest.*  
*The Kremlin maintained its defamatory narratives about claimed US involvement in Ukrainian biolaboratories and Russian nuclear capabilities to discredit and intimidate the West.*  
*The Kremlin continued to downplay the effects of Western sanctions on the Russian economy and threatened the West with counter-sanctions leveraging Russian energy exports.*",9aa7aab0aa44677ec941fc90a6abba4d38aedd77,True,False,,,,,0,1648674778,,0,{},i2rl4s0,False,t3_ts8y5e,False,True,t3_ts8y5e,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ts8y5e/ukraine_megathread_march_30/i2rl4s0/,1648674798,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648645978.0,

Agreed. Hillary wrote in *Hard Choices*, her memoir from the time she was Sec of State about trying to convince various European countries to start exploring fracking and other unconventional hydrocarbon exploitation circa 2010. 

She warned them about becoming too dependent on Russia and told them that it was a matter of time before they would be blackmailed.

Apparently, Russia may have helped *fund the anti-fracking* lobby in Europe because it is not dependent on that type of technology. Fracking and shale have absolutely upended the United State's national security implications. Europe could have had that too.

**U.S. intelligence suggests that Putin’s advisers misinformed him on Ukraine.**

WASHINGTON — President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has been misinformed by his advisers about the Russian military’s struggles in Ukraine, according to declassified U.S. intelligence.

The intelligence, according to multiple U.S. officials, shows what appears to be growing tension between Mr. Putin and the Ministry of Defense, including with the Russian defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, who was once among the most trusted members of the Kremlin’s inner circle.

Speaking in Algiers, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken acknowledged Mr. Putin had been given less than truthful information from his advisers.

“With regard to President Putin, look, what I can tell you is this, and I said this before, one of the Achilles' heel of autocracies is that you don’t have people in those systems who speak truth to power or who have the ability to speak truth to power,” Mr. Blinken said. “And I think that is something that we’re seeing in Russia.”

Other American officials have said that Mr. Putin’s rigid isolation during the pandemic and willingness to publicly rebuke advisers who do not share his views have created a degree of  wariness, or even fear, in senior ranks of the Russian military. Officials believe that Mr. Putin has been getting incomplete or overly optimistic reports about the progress of Russian forces, creating mistrust with his military advisers.

Mr. Putin seemed genuinely unaware that the Russian military had been using conscripts in Ukraine, and that drafted soldiers were among those killed in action, according to the U.S. officials. Mr. Putin’s ignorance showed “a clear breakdown in the flow of accurate information to the Russian president,” according to a U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the declassified, but still sensitive, material. There “is now persistent tension” between Mr. Putin and the Defense Ministry, the official said.

The American intelligence assessment also said that Mr. Putin had an incomplete understanding about how damaging Western sanctions had been on the Russian economy, officials said.

The war continues to go poorly for Russian forces. Ukraine’s military has not only held its own but also begun counterattacking. Some U.S. officials believe that senior Russian officials are wary of delivering truthful assessments — potentially afraid that the messengers of bad news will be held responsible for the battlefield failures.

The Russian military’s stumbles have eroded trust between Mr. Putin and his Ministry of Defense. While Mr. Shoigu had been considered one of the few advisers Mr. Putin confided in, the prosecution of the war in Ukraine has damaged the relationship.

Mr. Putin has put two top intelligence officials under house arrest for providing poor intelligence ahead of the invasion, something that may have further contributed to the climate of fear.

The state of peace talks. Pessimism about Russia’s willingness to tame its attacks in Ukraine is growing amid mixed signals from Kremlin officials on peace talks and reports of new strikes near Kyiv and Chernihiv, where Russia had vowed to sharply reduce combat operations.

Putin’s advisers. U.S. intelligence suggests that President Vladimir V. Putin has been misinformed by his advisers about the Russian military’s struggles in Ukraine. The intelligence shows what appears to be growing tension between Mr. Putin and the Ministry of Defense, U.S. officials said.

On the ground. As the Ukrainian military has kept Russian forces from taking over Kyiv and even regained some ground in the northeast, Russia appears to be shifting its focus to eastern Ukraine, particularly the Donbas region, which borders Russia and where residents tend to feel a connection to Russia.

With evidence of Mr. Putin’s frustration growing, the United States has in recent weeks been building up an intelligence case that he had not been getting accurate assessments from the Ministry of Defense and other senior officials. The U.S. officials believe that Mr. Putin is continuing to be misled and that senior advisers are unwilling to tell the truth.

What American intelligence sources there might be in the Kremlin is a tightly held secret. But since Russia began its troop buildup along Ukraine’s borders last year, U.S. intelligence officials have accurately predicted Mr. Putin’s moves.

The declassified information was reported earlier on Wednesday by The Associated Press.

Russian forces announced a shift in their posture around Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, on Tuesday, though American officials voiced skepticism that Russia was stopping its attacks as a peace gesture. Rather, some believe the moves are a further sign that Russia is adjusting its failing strategy. It is also possible that the shifting strategy is a sign of dysfunction and miscommunication in the upper ranks of the Russian Defense Ministry.",9f2b1906aefba53692b4fdd3dcc216a91025e70f,True,False,,,,,0,1648671396,,0,{},i2rcnoc,False,t3_ts8y5e,False,True,t3_ts8y5e,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ts8y5e/ukraine_megathread_march_30/i2rcnoc/,1648671415,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648642596.0,

""In November 1994, pro-Moscow opposition forces led by Umar Avturkhanov stormed Grozny and were defeated.  Twenty Russian tanks were destroyed together with their crews, and the few surviving tankmen were captured.  Moscow renounced them - President Boris Yeltsin, a despotic ruler, couldn't have cared less about individuals, and he was infuriated that General Dudayev had acted beyond his authority.  In my opinion this was the real reason federal forces were sent into Chechnya.

The military operation to overthrow the Dudayev regime was launched on 11 December 1994.  It was poorly planned - recall the then minister of Defense General Grachyov's announcement that he would ""capture Grozny with two regiments in two hours.'  from the outset, the army was betrayed by the high command.  Its soldiers were insufficiently trained, depressed and demoralized; they did not understand the aims of this war, and they were treated as cannon fodder.

That December in Grozny the Russian army bore huge losses.  On New Year's Eve, the 131st Maikop brigade was almost completely wiped out.  Various other units approaching the city from different directions were blocked and partially destroyed.  People were killed in the thousands.  To this day there are no official statistics for casualties in the first Chechnya campaign.  Under the current Russian government we'll never know them anyway because they are catastrophic.  But according to unofficial information, in January alone almost five thousand Russian officers and soldiers were killed in the Battle of Grozny.

The Chechen losses, not to mention the deaths among the civilian population, are not known and probably never will be - no one counted them at all.""",3f5b7b436888b088ec686272b0feb0885add922a,True,False,,,,,0,1648669954,,0,{},i2r8yv1,False,t3_ts8y5e,False,True,t1_i2qc0vm,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ts8y5e/ukraine_megathread_march_30/i2r8yv1/,1648669969,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648641154.0,

&gt;Can we stop this German propaganda that sanctions are already strong and ban Russian energy exports to Europe? It's still a billion euros per day.

It's in the works, but it takes time to completely reroute global energy infrastructure to cut Russia off as a supplier.

Germany for example needs to build three floating LNG terminals to allow ships to supply enough natural gas to replace Russian gas. As for oil, they can take large amounts by ship at Rostock, but not enough to make up for Russian oil. Thus, they're working with Poland to get a deal for ships to deliver oil to Gdansk and then have Poland's pipeline sections (which were carrying Russian oil to Germany) get switched over to deliver the imported oil instead. In the meantime, Germany is letting their contracts to purchase Russian oil to expire, and is making some of its national reserves available to help shore up the supply deficit in the short term.

Shortages of food, water and fuel
Social media contains many reports of Russian soldiers lacking food and even fuel for tanks, but it is hard to tell whether those are isolated cases or widespread problems.

British intelligence tweeted March 17 that logistical problems were “preventing Russia from effectively resupplying their forward troops with even basic essentials such as food and fuel.” A senior U.S. defense official said some Russian soldiers have suffered frostbite because they lacked cold-weather gear.

The New York Times reported that some soldiers carried meals that expired in 2002, and it intercepted radio communications between troops outside Kyiv who said they needed food, water and fuel. CNN cited two “sources familiar with the matter” who said Russia had asked China for rations. And plenty of videos of soldiers looting have circulated, which Kofman said is not uncommon for Russian troops in wartime.

Questionable medical care
A vital aspect of military planning is how best to treat and transport wounded soldiers, ideally within the first hour after a trauma, said Cynthia Cook, a military logistics expert who directs the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. She said there have been reports of inadequate medical support for Russian troops.

“You know,” Cook said, “one of the many, many horrifying things about this whole war is the idea that Russia would not be prepared to adequately support their soldiers in terms of their medical needs.”

On March 23, a NATO official estimated that between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian troops have been killed since the invasion began in late February, and many more have been wounded — so many that the Pentagon said Russia is pulling in reinforcements who are deployed elsewhere. The British defense ministry said Russia is hiring soldiers from pro-Kremlin mercenary group Wagner.

Low supplies of guided missiles
“Capturing cities is an extremely bloody, time-consuming event,” said Vershinin. Urban terrain favors defenders who know the territory, and it provides endless places to hide and opportunities for ambush. It also forces an attacker to use an enormous amount of ammunition.

Most likely, few people outside the Kremlin know how many missiles, rockets and artillery shells Russia started with or how many it has used to bombard Ukrainian cities; all countries keep their military stockpiles secret. But Forbes reported that a Pentagon official said Russia appears to be running low on precision munitions such as guided missiles, and Reuters reported that those missiles have a failure rate of up to 60 percent.

Russia exports plenty of weapons systems to the Middle East and Asia, Galer said, so analysts will be watching for delivery delays that would indicate Russian defense manufacturers can’t meet demand.

Excessive vehicle breakdowns
Since the invasion began Feb. 24, Russia has lost more than 2,000 vehicles, including more than 300 tanks, according to open-source reports. The Ukrainians destroyed and captured some; others were abandoned.

Some of the tanks were generations old and not well-equipped, including the T-72, a Soviet-era tank that first entered production more than 50 years ago.

Military operations are tough on vehicles, Vershinin said. “Combat vehicles go off-road, they go on dirt roads, gravel roads, that constantly shake everything and they literally shake things apart, like the little, tiny pieces, the screws come loose. Tiny pins fall out. So it’s very common for armored vehicles, even wheel trucks, to break under an intense operating environment. That actually will explain why we’ve seen so many pictures of abandoned Russian vehicles. They simply broke along the way.”

But the Russian rate of breakdown appears to be high, especially considering Russia invested a lot in modernizing its military.

“Are they maintained on a regular basis? And is there adequate supply?” asked Cook. “We can infer by what’s happening that that’s probably not the case.”

Galer said maintenance shortcomings are being compounded by the fact that troops had been doing exercises for two months before crossing into Ukraine — “literally just rolled straight off the exercise and into the conflict, so there was no time for them to do essential equipment maintenance before they started the advance.”

For all the vehicles in our example formation, just two are “recovery vehicles” — tow trucks that are usually driven by mechanics. Only one is heavy-duty enough to tow a tank. Factor in the round-trip distance, and it becomes a tactical decision whether to tow a vehicle for repair or abandon it.

After a muddled start, Russia may yet adapt to the situation it finds itself in on the ground, and find a way to keep it soldiers fed, fueled, and moving forward.

But the way the invasion has played out so far will be a much-studied cautionary tale, Cook said, “a source of lessons learned for military planners and logistics planners in years and maybe decades to come, as analysts try to unpack what went wrong.”",3c40563c98173f4122808a1d9d73d9214d652f49,True,False,,,,,0,1648664421,,0,{},i2quv08,True,t3_tsc9b6,False,True,t1_i2qunn4,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tsc9b6/analysis_why_russias_military_is_bogged_down_by/i2quv08/,1648664437,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648635621.0,

Russia’s military was built for quick, overwhelming firepower, experts say, but its weakness is logistics. And on the roads of Ukraine a month after the first invasion, that weakness is showing.

‘The tyranny of distance’
Many analysts say the Russians assumed they would quickly capture the capital city of Kyiv and force President Volodymyr Zelensky out of power. Whatever the strategy, that outcome did not happen, and Russia has been bedeviled by an inability to keep supplies flowing to troops in a longer ground war.

After weeks of little success except in southeastern Ukraine, despite relentless shelling and thousands of military and civilian casualties, Moscow said during peace negotiations on Tuesday that it would “drastically reduce” military activity in the northern part of the country, near Kyiv and Chernihiv.

After a surprisingly fierce Ukrainian resistance, “we can suspect that [Russians] did not properly organize the logistics necessary for an effective Plan B, which was to have an actual, serious fight in what is the largest country in Europe outside of Russia,” said Michael Kofman, director of Russia studies at CNA, a Virginia-based think tank.

How Kyiv’s outgunned defenders have kept Russian forces from capturing the capital

Ukraine’s sheer size is a problem.

Russia prefers to move troops and supplies on railroads, and it is doing that now in the southeast after seizing Kherson and Melitopol and securing a crossing over the Dnieper River.

But it doesn’t control rail hubs such as Chernihiv in the north, and because the ground has been wet and muddy, Russian vehicles have to stick to roads.

“Trucking takes a lot of time,” said Kofman, “and the tyranny of distance becomes really, really challenging because they're trying to push a large force down some fairly narrow roads.”

And it’s not just one trip. Supply trucks and other support vehicles have to constantly shuttle back and forth.

What one Russian formation may look like
Weapons and fighters in any ground invasion would not last long without the support of mechanics, medics, engineers, truck drivers, cooks and other crew. That’s because the needs of soldiers fighting a modern war are enormous. On average, each Russian soldier goes through about 440 pounds of supplies a day, including food, fuel, ammunition, medical support, etc.

Russia has sent more than 150,000 troops into Ukraine, organized into various formations.

Here’s an example, a battalion tactical group, which would establish the front with 700 to 900 soldiers and an array of different types of vehicles.

It is one of many types of formations used by the Russian army, according to retired Lt. Col. Alex Vershinin, whose career with U.S. and NATO forces included building logistical models.

The Russian army operates with fewer support soldiers than other militaries. About 150 of the 700 to 900 troops could be considered support, and because this formation would be an arm of a larger force in the area, they could also expect help from other logistics units.

But the ratio would still not come close to that of the U.S. Army, which deploys about 10 support soldiers for every combat soldier, retired Lt. Col. Alex Vershinin said.

Problems and possible problems
If Russia’s invasion plan had called for slow, steady advances, Vershinin said, it would have tried to quickly control the airspace and then set up secure mini-bases every 30 to 40 miles as it captured territory. Each base would have a repair depot, medical station and stockpiles so that supplies were never far away.

But Russia instead tried to dominate in long, fast, first pushes, which stretched its supply line much further. For instance, Russia’s early push from Crimea to Kherson was about 120 miles, and the push from Belarus to Kyiv was 86. The maximum workable distance from a railhead is considered to be 90 to 120 miles.

Vershinin said he suspects that the infamous 40-mile convoy was not “stalled” outside Kyiv, but was intentionally stopped and that pieces were repositioned to act as a logistics base that would be out of range of Ukrainian artillery in case Russia tries to capture the city later.

In a satellite image, a large military convoy is seen north of Kyiv in late February.

The choice to go light on logistics may work in a quick military action but doesn’t leave much room for error in a longer one. Here are some problems the Russians appear to be having:

Inadequate protection of supply convoys
Trucks moving along supply lines need protection, especially if travel options have been narrowed to a few predictable roads.

But early on, Kofman said, Russian troops didn’t execute the basics of convoy escort, which involves armored vehicles and soldiers traveling with and defending vulnerable logistics vehicles. Supply vehicles were sometimes left on their own, even after the Ukrainian military advised citizens on social media to attack unarmored fuel trucks.

The British defense ministry tweeted March 17 that Ukrainian counterattacks have forced Russia to “divert large numbers of troops to defend their own supply lines.”

“It turns out advancing and extending your supply lines makes your support elements and your logistics vulnerable to ambush,” Kofman said, “and Ukrainians pretty quickly figured out that the Achilles’ heel on the Russian effort was the logistics.”

Scattered command, poor communication
Russia’s command structure has been “confused, at best,” said Andrew Galer, head of Land Platforms and Weapons at open-source defense intelligence agency Janes. It is not one structure but four, coming from four different regions of Russia. “A single, unified chain of command makes life a lot simpler,” he said, “and they’ve not got that.”

Galer said stark evidence of the faulty chain of command is that at least 15 senior Russian commanders, including seven generals, have been killed, according to the Ukraine Defense Ministry. Typically, such high-ranking officers would not be anywhere near the front lines, but they’ve had to go further forward than normal to impose order and direct operations at the lower levels.

Russian generals are getting killed at an extraordinary rate

Many Russian troops in the south appear to be professional soldiers who had been deployed in Crimea. But elsewhere, especially in the north, Russian forces appear to have many draftees who may be less motivated and less well-trained.

In addition, it appears that orders for the invasion were kept secret from the rank-and-file.

“They did not tell the troops they were actually being sent to invade Ukraine until very, very late in the game,” Kofman said. “Troops who believe that they are in an exercise are going to take a very different approach to thinking about logistics than they are if they actually believe they’re being sent into a large war.”

Communication was further disrupted when, in the process of bombing cities such as Kharkiv, Russian forces destroyed cell towers needed by their own secure network. They were forced to use unsecured lines that were easily intercepted. One Russian general was reportedly killed in an airstrike after the Ukrainians located him by his cellphone signal, the New York Times reported.

The US economy is competitive in sectors with a lot of future growth potential, remains a very large consumer market for non-US exporters (massive trade deficit) and retains a significant percentage of the world economy.

Russia's multi-pronged attack has failed. Troops were stalled across Ukraine and took heavy losses from attacks on their exposed supply lines. Clearly such an offensive is overambitious.

Of course there is the human constant but I’m not sure to what end that matters to you.

The last two paragraphs: 

&gt; In the meantime, 324 hulls for Ajax family vehicles have been built, along with 79 turrets, and 26 vehicles have been handed over to the Army, in return for total spending on the programme so far of more than £3 billion. The NAO report confirms that the vibration issues are not isolated to prototype vehicles. A target has been set to find a way to fix vibration issues by the end of this year; however, it is not clear if this is achievable, nor how long remedial work to the existing vehicles would take. Trials with army crews remain suspended, and it seems clear that the unchanged official 2025 target for full operational capability is unlikely to be achieved. 

&gt; Ajax has become the latest poster child for all that can still go astray with the British procurement system. Embarrassing at the best of times, in the current security environment such failings court far worse consequences.

&gt; Pretend that there were no Russian forces fighting in Ukraine, pretend and lies that if they were, it was just a bit if infantry

If there were russian forces in Donbass for 8 years - then how come they did not use long range precision weapons they are using so much now? What, these russian forces were straight stupid for 8 years, but this February, they suddenly became all brighter like a snap of a finger?

&gt; pretend that the war was about helping the Russian minority.

What kind of math you use which says that (68.8 + 74.9) / 2 = 71.85% is a ""minority""? 

Because that's how many natively-russian speaking people (i.e. not ukrainians) are living in Donbass region, as shown here: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Ukraine_census_2001_Russian.svg .

&gt; In February Russia went masks off and launched a purely colonialist invasion

""_Purely_ colonialist"" means no other factors are anyhow motivating russians to do this war. Which means NATO expansion being one of major causes of this war is not a factor, despite tons of experts saying otherwise. Which also means Ukraine's public statement about quitting Budapest memorandum, which effectively means Ukraine's threat to obtain, and then possibly use vs Donbass, nuclear weapons - is not a factor either. Which means dozens of thousands people killed during 8 years of that trench war in donbass, of which even OSCE officially confirmed ~13000 iirc, - is nothing significant too. Do you seriously think i would agree with all this? And do you really think you should? 

Don't you think it is quite stupid to just put a label of ""pure colonialism"" and be done with it, without any effort to try and understand real causes? 

How you think anyone could hope to anyhow help stop the war if they do not understand real causes of it?

&gt; backed by colonial demands to seize Ukraine, conquer it, subjugate the people and make the land part of the Russian empire

Ukraine per capita GDP - before this large scale war - was 3+ times lower than in Russia. Now with this war, it'll drop massively further down. Adding whole Ukraine would drag Russia down more than anything else, and Russia, far as i can tell, does not plan to do it. 

What is going on is quite different. Donbass region, with its ~3 million or so russian (ethnically) people, have most of those people wishing to live in, and be a part of, Russia. They said so in referendum back in 2014. That a crime? 

Donbass region also has large coal reserves and solid amount of heavy industries. Those are clear economic assets Russia could definitely make a use of. Given the fact people of the region themselves want to join Russia as regions, or at least be allies with Russia as independent republics - what you think Russia should do, seeing those people being shelled (per the link i gave in my previous comment) for 8 years? Say ""no""? Really? Would _you_ in Russia's shoes?

&gt; The push on Kyiv and anywhere else outside the donbass could not be masked as anything else.

Russians said from day 1 of this war that their goals are to de-militarize and de-nazify Ukraine, that's in every official channel. This means, not annex it. Just ""pull its teeth and claws out"" thing. Could this be true, considering 8 years of above mentioned shalling Ukraine did vs Donbass? More yet, how could Russia anyhow expect to do any economic cooperation and/or uniting with Donbass republics, if said shelling would continue indefinitely? How could Russia be sure Ukraine would not continue to kill civilians and ruin industrial and civil infrastructure from outside Donbass soil if this russian military operation would just happen within Donbass borders? 

Bottom line: pretending Russia is ""purely"" a villain, an evil state, an international bad guy, etc, - is easy and simple to do, but dangerous to the West itself, view. Even now, the West is already experiencing economic flak of all the sanctions hitting back the West itself. Keeping this primitive, so easy-to-maintain emotionally, view - will inevitably lead to further economic trouble in the West, possibly up to and including collapse of USD economy in the world and in US itself alike. It is now one real big problem that about hundreds millions of people, mainly citizens of western countries, are in the brainwashed state about it all. All those people will make decisions and actions further contributing to the decline of US dollar, further shortages of goods in the West (most notably natural gas, oil, wheat, other grains, fertilziers, steel, alluminium, nickel). Spreading this simplistic ""oh Russia is just a greedy evil warmonger"" - does not help, to say the least. But if you _must_ keep doing it, i am certainly not the one to force you stop. Neither my duty, nor desire. For all i care, global industrial civilization, western sort, is one big problem in and of itself, and it couldn't fail and collapse soon enough.

* Compared to rocket artillery it is less of a burden on logistics. The payload-to-total-weight ratio is worse for rocket artillery. As we've seen not only in Ukraine, but also in Iraq and pretty much every large scale modern conflict ever, logistics are crucial to success.
* Compared to cruise missiles they are much cheaper. 
* Compared to aircraft they are much easier to operate. Aifcraft need a lot of logistics, more skilled personell, more infrastructure, require more coordination with own or friendly forces.
* Compared to drones ... well, I'm not sure. Drones are a young weapon system. They've proved their worth, but I'm not convinced that they will do that well against an enemy with capable air defenses. And anti-drone warfare is in its infancy. We'll have to wait how things go, how easy or hard it will become to deal with drones and what kinds of drones we'll see.

In general: Any military has to think about economy of force. That's where tube artillery comes in. If you can hit something with an artillery strike, then that's usually much more efficient than doing the same damage with more sophisticated weapon systems. 

The range limitation of tube artillery basically mean that you can't attack everything with it. That's unfortunate, but not the end of the world for them, because they still can hit quite a lot of targets. Just use them for these and save your other, more expensive and complex, systems for the rest. If your artillery pounds your enemies front line and immediate read area, you have more planes and missles to strike its extended rear area. 

Furthermore you have to consider how well you can integrate the various weapon system into other units. You can integrate tube artillery into a batallion sized combat unit, sometimes even company sized, but try to integrate cruise missiles or aircraft - it's hopeless. So you need multiple units to cooperate and coordinate for each strike. 

On a strategic level you also have to consider production during wartime. It's not that hard to mass-produce shells, even with WWI technology is was possible to produce millions of them. Try to mass-produce cruise missiles or precision-guided bombs. It is sommewhat doable, but much harder - because those systems are much more sophisticated. 

So, in conclusion: I think artillery will stay with us and remain a viable tool for every military. Long range precision strikes will continue to supplement it, as they've done for decades until now, but tube artillery has distinct advantages that will keep it in use.",9f0b479b2470fecccc3acd884b05025cd17cd8af,True,False,,,,,0,1648641752,,0,{},i2pdlhb,False,t3_tqtbl6,False,True,t3_tqtbl6,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tqtbl6/how_much_can_the_range_of_traditional_cannon/i2pdlhb/,1648641763,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648612952.0,

China would have to strike every single one of them, and any piece of metal could contain a Patriot launcher.

That said I have no doubt that China will do very well against what Taiwan has right now, it has the missiles and drones to swarm main Taiwanese bases.

By contrast Taiwan lacks a missile system with serious range, like the S-400, meaning it'll struggle to hit anything that's not a sitting duck. And we've seen advanced SAMs struggle with drones, so even against those the Patriot might not be effective.

More importantly radars are a very easy target for China, take those out and Taiwan will be limited to passive sensors. If it gets data info from the US (as I'm sure is happening in Ukraine) that might not be a big problem but they're still limited in range against a NATO level of SEAD, which I believe China possesses.

I don't think Taiwan has more missiles than China has drones, certainly not at the high end spectrum. A Patriot missile costs $3 million, a Mig drone probably $100K, you can make them cheaper with specialized decoy drones that are little more than cannon fodder.

Then if Taiwan shoots at anything more valuable it'll probably be a fast and high flying jet of some sort, Israeli jets have been dodging missiles over Syria by the dozens with only a single loss.

And yes China has long been very open about their interest to use biological warfare. Unlike the West they consider it a perfectly fair way of fighting, and has a long history (Art of War mentions poisoning food and water). It makes perfect sense for China, if all Taiwanese are poisoned there will be no one left to defend Taiwan.

The answer depends a lot on the time frame. Firstly we have to acknowledge that battle hardened troops are much, much superior to green troops. As such the USSR could have conclusively won and utterly annihilated Europe in the period 1945-1960. However they lacked a viable nuclear deterrent and that was what kept Europe safe. 

As Europe rebuilt, the threat levels gradually subsided and I think in retrospect, it is obvious now that the USSR would've lost any hot war engagement. They did not maintain technological parity. However, it was in the interests of key actors to maintain the image of the USSR as a credible threat. 

In the 1980s, USSR would've conclusively lost. But after all, it didn't need the military to do it, it destroyed itself through internal collapse so we already know our answer there.

I think if we really drill down, we know our answer. Europe wasn't invaded by USSR, because they themselves knew they'd lose. They knew they didn't have the manpower or capability to defeat NATO. And Europe was never interested in invading Warsaw Pact because ultimately, most capitalist societies are driven by making money and not ideology.

Unless that distance is the moon, it's not very far. Even then, China can make it to the moon, they can not. 

&gt;The Japanese will sink ships by with their submarines without even bothering to declare war.

You need total control of the battlefield to do anything meaningful. Submarines are powerful. Yes, but if Japan has no air cover, then China's anti sub ships and planes will eat it alive. Without air superiority, Japan's own anti sub ships cannot operate, thus Chinese subs will also hunt Japanese subs together with other assets. 

&gt;The lesson of the battle of Jutland is that over 100 years later, we still don't know who won the battle of Jutland; but what we know is that the Germans starved.

I said Falklands, but interesting you bring up Jutland, another thing from Jutland, is that once you know you will likely lose strategically even if you win tactically, no one will send out their navy.

India, Japan are not going to send out their navy, and thus no blockade. 

Even if they can beat a Chinese fleet, their damage taken would further tilt the balance of power in favor of China, because China has enough to sustain loses.

Think of it this way. If India loses 2 modern destroyers, it's left with 2. Half its fleet is lost. IF China loses 8, it still has over 20, and if India loses 2 more, it's down to 0 and China loses 8 more, it still has \~15. At that point, Indian fleet is defenseless.

So India can win tactically, and destroy 16 destroyers to 4, a big blow, but be left defenseless without more modern destroyers for its fleet.

&gt; Also, whenever you hear that the US Navy in its war game saying that ""we will lose to X Navy"", you should understand that they do so to get money. By contrast, the US Air Force never says they lose in a war game and the US Army just don't play war games altogether.

They all say they lose wargames. In fact, so far PLA has almost never won a war game. Not much to it really. Just something people like to do and pretend it is something. The real thing is money.

But the military-operational perspective requires a slightly different view. The aviation infrastructure that the PRC is developing in Tibet and in their west and south-western regions are (1) either too far away for the PLAAF fighter squadrons thus requiring refuellers, which necessarily restricts engaging in battle (2) are located at high elevations thus reducing their payload (3) are open to interdiction to India long-range missile attacks (this is the primary reason India has extended the range of their Brahmos and are working on a successor variant independent of Russia). 

The recent Doklam incident allowed the IAF to test one specific matter. They presumed that their forward operating bases were under a concerted attack by the PLAAF/PLA. Thus, they dispersed to rearward airfields/bases to see if they could continue the battle from further back. This is because the combat range of their fighter remains unaffected for the most part given (a) the elevation at which their rear bases are located thus not impacting the combat payload (b) the distance between those bases and the projected combat area, which is augmented by the potential use of refuellers).

From a landwarfare perspective, India holds the advantage as the defender and commands the heights.

So, the rail-gun, as far as I know, probably isn't very viable in the near future. It's power hungry, and tears up barrels. Unless you had a crap ton of barrels on hand to replace, it's just a hog of a weapon for a naval system, let alone a land system. I'd further develop the technology, as its a worthy avenue of exploration, but I'd do it with the state of mind of further experimentation necessarily than refinement of (relatively) small problems. Like, around 2040 is when I'd maybe expect some sort of meaningful improvement in its prospects, and maybe not even then.

The bit on the ""Combustion Light-Gas Gun"" (CLGG) was what I was most intrigued by, particularly the projects by UTRON (15mm, 45mm, and 155mm variants).

This bit was very interesting:

&gt;CLGG.  UTRON first developed a 15-mm CLGG, which successfully proved the concept, and then designed and built a 45-mm CLGG, which successfully proved the scalability of the concept \[15\].  UTRON’s 45-mm CLGG has fired with projectile speeds of 2.5 km/s.  In addition, an automatic loader has been developed, installed, and successfully operated.  A special fuel-loading system and ignition device have also been successfully developed and deployed.  The light-gas propellant mixture can be manufactured on the battlefield.  
  
UTRON then developed and built the 155-mm CLGG that was successfully fired at its gun range in West Virginia.  The CLGG has experimentally demonstrated velocities greater than 4 km/s (13,120 ft/s). 

That seems to be a very high velocity ceiling for the technology. I'm not sure if you'd need speeds very high above 2 km/s on, say, a land system. So I'd be intrigued how much a 2 km/s muzzle velocity would fair?

I am curious if it could be created with a ""cartridge system"" in mind; based on figure 5, you have a chamber with the high-pressure gas-mix, and then you have the ""diaphragm"" keeping it in, but it bursts upon firing. This seems like it could be turned into a separate ""charge"" that's loaded into a barrel the same way separate powder charges are loaded into 155mm howitzer systems.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion_light-gas_gun) mentioned issues with consistency of muzzle velocity and the problem of hardening the sensitive components to these higher accelerations.

But given the statement that the gases had ""moderate temperatures"" to help increase barrel-life, do not have high electrical requirements, and seem to rely on fairly common and easily obtainable gasses (hydrogen and oxygen both come from...water), it might present the most promise in possibly creating a mobile land system using the technology that isn't too terribly expensive.

I do wonder what extra dangers would be posed in the event of failure however...and what if a counter-attack happens, striking a propellant charges? Would it be more uniquely dangerous in comparison to powder charges being hit by, say, stray shell fragments?

In terms of improving the conventional howitzer, I'd probably go down this road the most.",a980a63ca142491b77462deba78ebe478a314b0c,True,False,,,,,0,1648610678,,0,{},i2o6dn0,True,t3_tqtbl6,False,True,t1_i2nbdd7,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tqtbl6/how_much_can_the_range_of_traditional_cannon/i2o6dn0/,1648610691,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648581878.0,

It’s worth checking out [internal law for this. ](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docindex/v1_cha_chapter15_rule47)

&gt; Rule 47. Attacking persons who are recognized as hors de combat is prohibited. A person hors de combat is:

&gt; (c) anyone who clearly expresses an intention to surrender;  provided he or she abstains from any hostile act and does not attempt to escape.

&gt; The ability to accept surrender under the particular circumstances of combat was discussed by the United Kingdom and the United States in the light of the war in the South Atlantic and the Gulf War respectively.[32] The United Kingdom pointed out that it may not be possible to accept surrender from a unit while under fire from another position. Hence, a party which “takes” surrender is not required to go out to receive surrender; instead, the party offering surrender has to come forward and submit to the control of the enemy forces. The United States took the position that an offer of surrender has to be made at a time when it can be received and properly acted upon and that a last-minute surrender to an onrushing force may be difficult to accept. The question remains, however, as to how to surrender when physical distance may make it difficult to indicate an intention to surrender or may subject one to charges of desertion.

So it depends a lot on the details of the situation. It’s worth reading all of the discussion.

Russia might be very low on missiles, but they can use artillery or dumb bombs.

&gt; they still have many other areas of Russia they need to protect

From whom? Unless Azerbaijan decided to attack Armenia, who are they even ""protecting"" from? The riot police protects Putin from Russian civilians just fine.

&gt; it also is debateable whatever troops they send will be any more skilled

They will be just as ship relative to NATO standards, but that only matters for so much. Average Ukrainian soldiers aren't really that much more skilled, they just had an advantage of being on the defensive. If Ukrainians try to go on a major offensive, every factor that worked against the Russians will work against the Ukrainians.

&gt; They will be outnumbered by the Ukrainians, the Ukr will have practically unlimited supply from the west. 

""Practically unlimited"" as in 0 planes, 0 long range missiles, 0 long range AA, and basically 0 of anything that could be used for a meaningful counter-offensive.

No amount of NLAWs is going to win this war without much heavier equipment than Ukraine has been getting.

&gt; And given that they are winning why would the Ukrainians stop

That's some very weak ""winning"", Russians lost a few towns relative to their maximum reach, but they're about to take ruins of Mariupol, so overall they're still progressing, just really slowly, and at high casualties.

I'm not sure if Ukrainians can even liberate Kherson, and that's on their side of Dnieper, so that's their best possible target.

Much of maneuver was about hiding this for as long as possible so as to benefit from some measure of surprise. Meanwhile, opposing commanders have to deduce the answers and, ultimately, gamble. In the future, according to Hubin, this will be more difficult to do because of all the sensors. The challenge will be less getting information than processing it.

Hubin uses the analogy of chess players: Both can see exactly where all the pieces are, yet it is still possible to surprise one’s opponent. The surprises are intellectual. “Surprise is realized by he who has the best vision of the situation, he who grasps the soonest and with the most clarity what is happening, and who knows how to coordinate the apparently incoherent action of his pieces such that the adversary remains eaten by doubt and does not know what move to make.”",4b50eecb268b641bdf5494e340cd5dd9d06b96bf,True,False,,,,,0,1648604439,,0,{},i2nthng,False,t3_tqxgsl,False,True,t1_i2nk7mc,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tqxgsl/ukraine_megathread_march_29/i2nthng/,1648604452,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648575639.0,

How can you confidently state that?

Less than six weeks ago experts confidently stated that Kyiv would fall in days and Russia would inevitably conquer Ukraine.

To prevent the Ukrainians from retaking their territory, Russia *needs to actively stop them from doing that.* They need to sustain that effort with manpower and materiel. 

We're uncertain of their ability to replace their casualties, but at least fairly certain that any replacements will be even less trained and less motivated than what they originally had.

Same goes for materiel - sanctions limit their ability to produce any advanced weaponry (guided missiles, modern tanks, fighter jets, etc) and probably also reduce their capacity to replace more basic stuff.

Meanwhile Ukraine is mobilizing, training and equipping a large force of reserves and volunteers. All highly motivated. It has access to a constant stream of advanced Western weapons and a range of supplies needed for its logistics. It's likelier that Western support will increase rather than decrease given how successfully the Ukrainians are using it and it becomes clear victory can be achieved.

If China has a very small navy and force projection, then the countries you just named by comparison has basically no navy or air force at all.

You fallen for propaganda, you know why America like to say China has the largest navy? So they can say China has smaller ships. It's not even close to real. China over the last 10 years has launched, commissioned more than the US and almost more than the entire world(including the US). The same thing will happen in the next 10 years.

China can lose half its navy and still has enough to overwhelm QUAD(minus US).

India has 3 commissioned modern ""AEGIS"" destroyer, China has over 30. China will likely more than double this over the next decade.
