Yeah, the initial invasion would be harder in some ways, but also a lot easier.  

Ukraine can be resupplied by just driving over the border from the EU.  This means Russia can do absolutely nothing to stop Ukraine from remaining in supply.  Ukraine is currently murdering Russia in the logistics department because their supply line are easy, and many of their weapons factories exist in the West outside of the conflict.  In a battle for Taiwan though, everything has to come in on ship, and the closet resupply point is Japan.  China can in fact cut off Taiwan with missile attacks against commercial shipping.  The US would have to convey in supplies under a missile attack.

Taiwan cannot defend itself without direct US involvement.  Defending Ukraine by spending massive amounts of supplies was an easy position for the US because it involved little risk of escalation.  Taiwan on the other hand would need the US to directly fight China in order to have any chance of not being starved out.  That means that the US needs to commit to a bloody engagement 4000+ miles from it's shore with a nuclear armed nations.  It's not even clear that whoever is President when China attacks would be willing to defend Taiwan.

Ukraine has manpower advantages over Russia.  Ukraine is a big nation that is 1/3 the population of Russia. A fully mobilized Ukraine has more man power than Russia has.  Even a fully mobilized Russia is just going to reach manpower parity.  Taiwan on the other hand has 1/60 the population of China.

The Ukrainian military is just more capable.  The Ukrainian military has been fighting Russia and perfecting their tactics for years.  Taiwan has not fired a shot in anger in generations (granted, China is the same boat).  Likewise, Ukraine has proven that it will fight to the last man, while it's questionable of the Taiwanese are as committed to the defense of their nation.  They might be, it's just unproven at this point.

If I was a betting man, I'd bet on Ukraine beating Russia long before I bet on Taiwan fending off China.  I'm not saying that Taiwan is for sure doomed, but I think their position is a lot uglier, and they are a lot further away from being able to effectively defend themselves than Ukraine was.  I'm sure that Ukraine was a wakeup call for Chinese military planners to realize what a disaster they could be walking into, but I don't think it will scare off a determined attacker.",6d21d3f69786aa06185624f02bc5296b9fe9414b,True,False,,,,,0,1652828358,,0,{},i908nlh,False,t3_urolw6,False,True,t1_i9048lz,/r/geopolitics/comments/urolw6/what_is_a_realistic_date_of_a_chinese_invasion_of/i908nlh/,1652828373,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1652799558.0

That being said, I personally do not think the PRC has the capability for retaking ROC profitably anytime soon. It still lacks the necessary naval and marine capabilities to take-and-hold the island.

It could potentially level the island outright with its missile advantage, but that would basically boil down to a very fast way to waste a lot of armaments for zero gain. (Not to mention the international hostility it would then face.)

As time passes, these factors become less favorable for war:

* Economic integration - Taiwan is the largest Chinese-speaking economy to do business with China and a major engine for growth on the mainland.

* Lack of mainlander civilian interest in war, coupled with lack of islander civilian interest in reunification.

* Continued economic integration of ROC with global supply chains and mature trade links, which make the PRC the bad guy in any military action that disrupts this.

Increasingly it feels like a military option from the PRC would be counterproductive, a zero-gain mission at best.

The former could plausably take place in the late 2020s to 2030s, when china's economy and demography are still assumably stable. Any longer than that and the plausability of a succes in a chinese invadion dips.

TSMC is a single point of failure for all Western markets in regards to 5nm and 3nm chips and by bombing/destroying the company’s facilities they could really hurt all of Western supply chains. This would cause an outright stock market crash. Yes, TSMC is building a US facility but that will take years and after it’s finished it will only supply 3% of highest grade chips by volume. Texas Instruments and Intel have poor business models and haven’t been able to scale up to the kind of chip fabrication at scale that Western companies require. Micron builds memory chips, not logic chips which are more skill, resource, and talent intensive to build. Only Samsung is well positioned to pick up the slack. 

Fortunately from what I understand most military chips don’t use 5nm or 3nm nodes but TSMC as a single point of failure is still a huge issue that people don’t openly talk about and I think it’s because the US political leadership is uncomfortable with it.

[],False,,exoriare,,,[],,,,text,t2_7n1sq,False,False,"I think Taiwan happens in June or Sept. 

It's absurd to think that the PRC will do this like a repeat of D-Day. They haven't built up nearly the amphibious assault force to pull off such a feat. More importantly, they've shown no *intention* of scaling up their amphibious invasion force. A wholesale invasion would require a massive buildup of materiel on the coast - they'd be telegraphing their intentions and forgoing any chance of strategic surprise. Just imagine how humiliating that would be - China starts preparing for an invasion, and within a few weeks there are literally thousands of anti-ship weapons amassed in the Taiwan Strait. Backing down would be a massive humiliation, but being forced to battle on ground that your enemy has prepared is even more foolish. Beijing would never put themselves in that position. 

Instead of looking for them to execute on a plan we expect them to try, we should instead look at what preparations they have made. If we do that, a different picture emerges - they're going to engage in a ""peaceful"" blockade of Taiwan with probably tens of thousands of unarmed merchant marine vessels. 

1) These are Chinese waters. Everyone recognizes that Taiwan has its own government, but the land itself and its territorial waters all fall under the ""One China"". 

2) The explicit goal will not be the subjugation of Taiwan - that would be too much for the West to accept. China will instead demand concessions like demilitarization or for Taiwan to formally accept their status as a province of China. The goalposts can be moved gradually - Taiwan will be allowed to save face with something like ""One Country, Two Systems."" TSMC will be allowed to continue working with various guarantee for its security. 

3) The blockade will prevent all food and fuel from entering Taiwan except for what is provided by China as humanitarian aid. ""Nobody has to starve, but Taiwan must shed some of its pride."" Taiwan imports 90% of its fuel and 80% of its food, so they'll be hungry very soon. 

Ideally, China would rather have this whole process be non-violent, but they are prepared for escalation. Their merchant marine fleet has 172k ships and boats, and everything has been operationalized down to the smallest fishing boat (which have been provided with metallic inflatable balloons to increase their radar profile and soak up anti-ship missiles). Xi put himself in charge of this effort, which indicates it is more significant than a regular ""naval reserve"" type asset base. 

China's biggest goal is to keep the US aircraft carriers out of action. To this end, they've invested heavily in anti-carrier capabilities. If the US did get a carrier involved, it wouldn't be unreasonable for China to swamp it with hundreds of missiles, overwhelming even a heavy defensive screen. The loss of a carrier would be game-over for the US, since they have no way of knowing if China could replicate such a feat over and over again. Ideally the US would want to escalate to hitting targets on the Chinese mainland, but that's a *big* escalation if only your military assets have been targeted. And it's ultimately a losing game anyway - nobody would expect China to be defeated by a conventional bombing/missile campaign. 

Ultimately though, China will do its utmost to warn the US off. They've built outlines of US carriers on their testing range to explicitly warn the US ""we can kill you, so don't be reckless"". China would like nothing more than to beat the US by using imagination rather than weapons. 

One last thing has to fall into place before anything can happen, and that's China's new aircraft carrier. It's in the finishing stages of construction, and they've been rushing to get it to sea since last fall. It's now a [couple of weeks](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18540321/china-invade-taiwan-new-aircraft-carrier/) from launch. While this ship won't be operational for years yet, it's too tempting of a target while it's in dock, so China must get it to sea before they engage in any moves. 

Once that's done, all the other pieces are in place. China stopped sharing data on commercial ship locations last fall with a new security law. Satellites are showing a massive increase in ships ""stuck"" in Chinese ports. The lockdowns are providing a great justification for a massive buildup of merchant marine ships.

China has so many problems It's facing/about to face it most likely won't be able to focus on Taiwan. China is surrounded by enemies on all sides and their perception globally which China cares about is already in the gutter. 

From China’s search for Security.

&gt;China is too bogged down in the security challenges within and around its borders to threaten the West unless the West weakens itself to the point of creating a power vacuum.

&gt;First, in contrast to states with globe- spanning interests, China is still mainly a regional power.

&gt;The downside of China’s geographical position is its exposure in all directions to instability, pressure, and even invasion. Potentials for conflict are everywhere around China’s periphery. Its nearly 14,000 miles of land borders are the longest in the world. The 4,000- mile boundary with the Soviet Union was for twenty- five years the longest unfriendly frontier in the world. At one point, nearly 1.5 million troops were ranged closely along the two sides of this line, and some on the Soviet side were armed with nuclear weapons. The two sides began to demilitarize the border and restore local cross- border trade in the late 1980s. 

&gt;But the breakup of the Soviet Union gave rise to a new set of neighbors that was in some ways even more complicated than before: Russia plus five Central Asian states (three of them directly contiguous to China) and a Mongolia set free from Russian domination and committed to democracy and relations with the West. The new states’ internal troubles have the potential to weaken Chinese control of Tibet, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia, and their foreign policies create tension with China over ethnic, trade, and security issues. Along the eastern and southern sides of the Chinese landmass are sea borders ranging for 9,000 miles. All along this coastline, the Han heartland lies exposed. Set back from the coast by distances ranging up to only about 600 miles, most of the heartland consists of fertile, well- watered lowland plains and valleys that grow wheat and rice. 

&gt;Only a small part of the heartland is protected by coastal mountains from seaward attack. When Japan invaded in 1937– 1938, it occupied most of this area in a year of fighting; in today’s era of precision- guided munitions, ballistic missiles, satellite technology, and nuclear weapons, the heartland’s population is even more exposed to attack. Most of China’s borders are easier to invade than to defend. The long coastline was invaded repeatedly in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The inland border regions are mountainous and cold, difficult to garrison and defend, and open to subversion by outside powers who might appeal to the resident ethnic minorities. 

&gt;Facing the U.S., Russia, Japan, and India, China’s defenders do not benefit from the presence of buffer states on most of the likely invasion routes. During the twentieth century, China engaged in military conflicts with Japan, the U.S., South Korea, India, Russia, Vietnam, and Taiwan. Even though relations have improved greatly with each, in the long view all remain potential military rivals. The armies of these seven states rank in the top twenty- five of world armies by size. China’s army, even though it is the biggest in the world, suffers a net two and a half to one disadvantage of troop strength compared to the aggregate militaries of its six main regional neighbors, even leaving aside the more distant U.S., which is likely to get involved in almost any conflict that involves China. By way of comparison, the U.S. enjoys a more than three to one manpower advantage in troop strength over the combined armed forces of its immediate neighbors Mexico, Canada, and Cuba, with whom military conflict is in any case almost unthinkable today.

China doesn't have the ability to invade and take over Taiwan. If it did, it would've taken action by now. And it won't acquire the ability anytime soon.

In an invasion, the element of surprise is crucial. It would take many hours for Chinese ships to load, cross the Taiwan Strait and land on the island. The Taiwanese would detect this and have ample time to prepare. China could launch missile attacks on Taiwanese aircraft before hand, but that would break the surprise, and invite an American response. 

Taiwan has a formidable military and would be able to beat the Chinese without outside help. China has no experience in amphibious warfare. But even if it did, the logistics of such an operation would still be incredibly difficult, its forces would be left extremely vulnerable, and it would have to be prepared to take heavy losses.

Economically its rather simple, have they been part of the EU for a significant period of time? No, then you're ""Eastern"".

Generally all the former Warsaw pacts countries are considered part of eastern Europe.
Geographically thos definitions has problems though, Prague for example is more to the West than Vienna.
That's why in some maps Czech Republic, and sometimes Slovakia and Hungary too are deemed as Middle Europe or mitteleuropa.

Sometimes the Baltic countries are considered as belonging to Northern Europe, sometimes only Estonia is included, which shares a similar culture with Finland.

If we talk about the Balkans, Greece is usually considered as Southern or Mediterranean Europe and not as part of eastern Europe.
As for the other countries, they are usually included in Eastern Europe but a lot of Slovenians and Croatians consider themselves as southern Europe and this is taught and some croatian and slovenians schools too. And geographically and culturally it makes sense, since these two countries share a lot of ties with Italy. Most of their coastal cities belonged to the Republic of Venice and had a sizeable italian population for centuries. They're also both Roman Catholic countries.

Countries that are almost universally considered eastern europe and they themselves don't object to that claim are: Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia and North Macedonia.

Countries that are usually considered eastern Europe but sometimes included in Mitteleuropa: Czechia, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland.

Countries that are usually considered in eastern Europe but sometimes included in Northern Europe: Letonia, Latvia, Lithuania (especially Letonia and Latvia, Lithuania less so).

Countries that are usually considered eastern europe but sometimes included in Southern europe: Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Albania.",e9a73d270ebd1bce2c75f735303306c77043099c,True,False,,,,,0,1652804603,,0,{},i8yntwj,False,t3_uro2s4,False,False,t3_uro2s4,/r/geopolitics/comments/uro2s4/what_counts_as_eastern_europe/i8yntwj/,1652804614,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1652775803.0

What do you think had the Communist been too weak to be called a threat, would the US still sided with those oppressed under colonialism, or side with the more wealthier, culturally similar European? Would the European even willing to give up their colonial empires at all?

Well, the US had supported national sovereignty at least rhetorically (and with qualifications) since the end of WW1. Wilson's Fourteen Points. And then there's the Atlantic Charter promoted by Roosevelt, who was much less hostile to China and the Soviets than his predecessors. So I don't think that one can reduce it to to Cold War pressures.

In fact, from what I've read - and I'm hardly an expert - in some ways, the Cold War muted the United States' nationalist impulses. For example,  how they were 'convinced' by allies to support their colonial empires by painting independence movements as being communist in nature. A particularly egregious example was France blackmailing them into supporting their war in Vietnam. Or an only slightly less egregious example, how Great Britain continually framed Mossadegh's government as communist because of his 'anti-British' actions.

This isn't meant to be an apologia of United States foreign policy. Alongside their nationalist impulses are arguably stronger imperial impulses that they have indulges in the Americas and the Middle East. I just think it is important that the US does have some nationalist and liberal tendencies, even if they are usually suborned to imperialist or power politics considerations. And unfortunately I think the latter impulses would be dominant in a multipolar world.

&gt;I'd like to think it's different now, more countries like India, Indonesia, Vietnam, etc, can exercise their own control over their country. Whilst they are not invulnerable, they can't be easily messed with like before, and as a result it allows for some agency.

Except for India, none of these countries can withstand coercion by superpowers, imo. But really that's beside the point.

My greater point is more to complicate your picture of the multipolar world. It is true that the presence of more 'poles' brings greater opportunity for smaller powers by allowing them to play the greater powers  against each other and extract concessions. But it also brings heightened risks and threats, as such diplomacy and ambiguity can prompt very coercive or outright violent responses from one or more of the powers. 

It can also lead to blindness or myopia among the Great Powers who frame *every* world event in terms of competition. Think about how every nationalist or anti-colonial movement was framed in terms of the Cold War prism, whether those movements wanted to or not.

In such an environment, neutrality becomes extremely hard to achieve. Much more so than in the unipolar world. One must 'play the game', whether one wants to or not. And when playing the game, ambiguity becomes dangerous and brings just as much, if not more, risk as reward.",e427f52be672fdf7c2c80769b4330e9281e9bf03,True,False,,,,,0,1652765720,,0,{},i8wx32z,False,t3_uqr5lm,False,True,t1_i8wuvz4,/r/geopolitics/comments/uqr5lm/why_is_russia_and_china_so_concern_about_usnato/i8wx32z/,1652765732,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1652736920.0

That is true, but you have to remember that most of third world countries back then have just gain independence from their colonial masters, some have even fought bloody wars over it. They have little to no industry, lackluster bureaucracy, nor decent military to protect themselves with, thus unable exercise any kind of sovereignty.

Anyway, my point is that, while the unipolar moment has had its excesses, I don't think it's been worse than the bipolar or multipolar eras. You argue that more poles would make the US (or the West) more restrained but it might just spur them to greater lengths to secure and/or expand their influence. I think the latter is more supported by history. And while it is true that the US is more unrestrained in the unipolar moment, it is also, I think, more complacent.

Historically, the area now known as Ukraine was used as an invasion route into Russia proper as it is flat.

For China, same thing with Korea. The Japanese used it as a springboard to invade Manchuria(Northeast China) in 1931, and used the land captured to further invade in 1937.

So looking at it this way, it makes sense as to why Russia and China do what they do. Having the Warsaw Pact back in the Cold War meant the West had to push through a lot more of Eastern Europe before reaching Russia proper.

North Korea is a buffer from having US troops right on the Yalu River.

For all those saying that  Russia and China want to subjugate their neighbors does have an element of truth as well. But the U.S. invading is never out of the question if/when ABM becomes a lot better. 

And more importantly, things can change rapidly, and may lead to an invasion that we think is impossible today. Did Saddam think that the US would invade him in 2003? Did the Chinese think the Japanese would invade them in 1910?
