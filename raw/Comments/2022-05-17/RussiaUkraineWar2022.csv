In mu circles and where I am from people have always complained that we do not take the Russian threat seriously enough and that we do not spend enough for our military. I have bwwn pro nato ever since I have had any opinions about nato.

Even though a lot of people have been for appeasement towards Russia, most people have always distrusted them. Some snively thought that the Russian leadership is rational and leaves us alone if we do not do anything to provoke them. Militarily we have got ever closer to nato since the 90s but politcally the decades of soviet appeasement and its positvie outcome made snto ascension impossible politically. Manay thought that we had some sort of special relationship with Russia and could influence them to be a normal country with business relations.

If so, I'm not sure why so many commenters are lauding them as heroes. I wholeheartedly support Ukraine all the way, but these particular Ukrainians are why Putler keeps getting away with peddling his lies about ""denazification."" They are explicitly a [core element of the Kremlin's narrative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azov_Battalion#Use_in_Russian_propaganda). Having a self-described Nazi paramilitary unit fighting alongside you is terrible optics and great fodder for the Russian propaganda machine. [By the Azov Battalion's own estimate, ""only"" 10-20% of its members are Nazis](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/03/10/ukraine-azov-brigade-nazis-abuses-separatists/24664937/). 

I know they have supposedly ""depoliticized"" since the beginning of the war, but their continued flaunting of swastikas and other Nazi symbols on their uniforms, helmets, and tattoos suggests that they've only begun saying this in an effort to secure the support of moderates and reduce any PR friction that might interfere with the influx of foreign aid. 

A couple of years ago, Oleksiy Kuzmenko wrote a prescient article for the Atlantic Council arguing that they ""have significantly damaged Ukraine’s international reputation and left the country vulnerable to hostile narratives exaggerating the role of extremist groups in Ukraine."" He seems to have been spot on, as they've lent credence to ruZZia's otherwise nonsensical Nazi narrative. 

The Azov Battalion is home to a handful of bad actors whose contribution on the battlefield is probably outweighed by the effect of their repugnant beliefs on public opinion and, by extension, Ukraine's ability to counter disinformation.

They may be great at killing Russian fascists, but as fascists themselves, their overall effect has been a net hindrance to the actual good guys who make up 99+% of Ukraine's fighting forces and just want to defend their homeland and way of life.",e54a945b7f846f36d2d056a30e137c28313c6a0b,True,False,,,,,0,1652827834,,0,{},i907jx7,False,t3_urspp4,False,True,t3_urspp4,/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/urspp4/russians_inspect_azov_members_who_surrendered/i907jx7/,1652827848,1,False,True,False,RussiaUkraineWar2022,t5_5wptpp,r/RussiaUkraineWar2022,public,,0,[],,1652799034.0,,

I had to say ""I am sorry but the way that you choose to express your frustrations is antisemitic. Zalenski is not a Nazi. Trudeau's not a Nazi""...I can't be around people who are following Russia. It hurts too much to argue their nonsense and then have them argue that I have to respect their opinion, which is actually a delusion.

What matters is history and understanding your history. Not your ethnicity. When I watch DS9+Voyager and they talk about the Maquis, Marseille I think of the white Mouse, Nancy Wake from WWII. The subtle references are lost on most people. When people say ""flight to nowhere"" I laugh thinking of the battle of the midway. In the last 5 years I've begun to branch out to understand the Japanese role better as they missed a lot of that in school. I did take post secondary courses about WWII (European focus). I watch the online content from the war museum and even join some of their online workshops (most recently a few weeks back).

 I studied EVERY aspect of the war, even what lead to it. How the women back home survived, how we fought, our spy operations, and the amazing inventions from WWII. I spent 30 years worth of my life being fascinated by WWII. I even listen to rat patrol radio..  The strategic value of the 101 being dropped behind enemy lines while the Allies dropped cashes of weapons and supplies to resistance fighters (enter Nancy Wake) and how the resistance destroyed rail lines and attacked Germans to slow down the response. So many things had to come together and the weather was so bad (which is part of why German leadership went to the they assumed the Allies would not attack such bad weather). So many men were scattered. 😔 And that's just one tiny piece of it!!!. So many important battles where fought. The campaign the 101 went through was insane. I doubt we'll ever see another like it. If you truly understood the 101 campaign I don't think you'd compare. I will however say that yes, Asov is indeed legendary.  I suppose you could say both are legendary and brave. 
 
I'm not arguing that those Azov defenders aren't heroes. Quite the opposite. I have nothing but respect for them and hope for the POW swap. Especially those women. I would be very worried going into Russian hands. I am a little surprised everyone was so shocked by Russian behavior. I mean WWII they raped A LOT and even more recently the atrocities in Syria. The Syrian refugees I help are all not shocked. I can't wait to read the books written on Asov and hear interviews from the defenders. It's definitely a piece of history I hope to gain more understanding of. 

I think you might enjoy a YouTube channel I like. 
Beau of the 5th column.


 I have a military background so I enjoy his military and centrist views. I've been following him since Jan 6 2021. I remember watching the insurrection and thinking that the lineup of guys snaking through the crowds looked funny... couldn't figure it out until Beau pointed it out..idiots we're using their dominant trigger hand to touch the person in front of them 😖. No person who has gone through basic training whatever use their trigger finger to touch the person in front of you because your trigger finger would be at the ready on your weapon and she would use your non-dominant hand to rest on the person's shoulder in front of you. These guys were just training in some bush. Not military trained.  It's instinctual. I haven't done basic training in about 20 years and even I could remember that...I spent 3 summers training on base for different training.  Anyway Beau's had great commentary about Ukraine. His reasoning is usually spot on.

One day my boys will be fighting age. I know how mother's felt just before WWII. Most of those women lost loved ones in WWI and the pandemic. As the radio blasted news leading them to war. Exciting their boys as soon, all the eligible men would sign up. For a long time my biggest fear was to be one of those women. Sending her husband and sons to fight. I read a book at 16 that had a huge impact. Beau has since helped reassure me that as a Canadian this would be highly unlikely. Drone wars are the future. Not shipping our boys across the Atlantic while Uboats chased them... Still. When Ukraine ordered it's men to stay I knew in my heart i had to do everything I could to help the women coming here. They were facing my biggest fear. I am so grateful with how our community has opened their homes. I see people in my community scramble last minute to pick up women at the airport and bring them to a home they can live in for free for months on end. It's inspiring. I play a supportive role. Organizing donations, offering advice, and this summer I will be opening up my music for healing program, for free to Refugees. I hope to help young children heal from trauma. My experience with the Syrians has lead me to want to do more. 

You see History ALWAYS repeats itself. I can only hope Russia's mistakes will be a lesson learned. Through all of this I hold to one truth. Us moms have to stick together.

at 9am the order was given for the British ships in the harbour to begin  
 bombarding the palace. By 09:02 the majority of Khalid’s artillery had   
been destroyed, and the palaces wooden structure had started to collapse

through a back exit of the palace, leaving his servants and fighters to   
defend the palace alone.

500 of Khalid’s fighters killed or wounded, mainly due to the high   
explosive shells exploding on the palace’s flimsy structure. One British  
 petty officer was also severely injured, but later recovered in   
hospital.

I'm also not sure what they had to do to the missiles to get them to work in a ground-firing mode. The biggest problem with firing from the ground is this: These missiles were designed with a radar seeker, so the aircraft carrying them would point them at their target from up in the sky, and the missile would see its target from the moment it launched all the way down to impact. When firing from the ground, you can't always see your target before you fire the missile, especially if it is multiple kilometers away behind a building or over a hill. You can't rely on being able to lock-on before you fire. So, they had to come up with some way to lock on to the correct target AFTER the missile had already launched.

My understanding is that Finland has been wanting to move westward for a very long time, going back to the Winter and Continuation war; Yet it was only Russian pressure that kept them close. Now in a joint move by both nations it seems that they will break their neutrality and join NATO. 

Overall this puts a lot of pressure on Russia. Especially if Ukraine can manage to hold itself together at the end of the conflict. There would essentially be a NATO wall from the Arctic to the Mediterranean, literally a geo-strategic wall spanning almost a quarter of the Earth. 

That “threat” to Russia will be an instigating factor for the Duma and Russians as a whole. They already see these alliances and trade networks as being a plot to destroy the motherland. But it is clear that this pressure is what is needed to call their bluff, and not just in isolation but as a unified whole devoted to common defense. 

Strategically, it would make sense to push back against Russia on their own expansionist holdings in Syria, Kazakhstan, and Belarus, and work to separate China and Russia from being potential strategic partners. 

This invasion was the single worst thing to happen to Russia so  far in the 21st Century. Sweden and Finland joining NATO is a long overdue move. I don’t think joining a defensive alliance will eliminate Swedens neutrality, rather it helps to enforce it by keeping them protected from outside threats. 

Russia has pushed and pushed and every time they do so they drive more states westward. Their own reasons for their actions are self fulfilling.

But they were attacking so they had a very long time to prepare each situation. The truth is the Germans faced an inferior force in the East. The Soviets did not field the numbers the German generals claimed. So while their forces were getting weaker their enemies were getting stronger they were getting weaker.

battle of Thermopylae, or some other famous battle where they fought bravely, despite the odds, and held no matter what. I'm glad there's been an evacuation. I really didn't think they'd get out🙏

I'm sorry. The 101 just isn't comparable. The campaign they led across Europe was inspiring. Their tactics, ability to beat the odds, and military feats are legendary. The years they spent in such awful conditions. I feel it's a bit disrespectful to compare. The 101 had to cross the Atlantic (no easy feat), train in Britain, get parachuted across enemy lines (which did not go according to plan- such a fucked up situation), then lead a campaign all the way to Berlin that included epic battles, the most famous likely being the Bulge.  The 101 who had foxholes and no winter clothing during some of the coldest nights. Not enough ammunition, clothes, or food. To this day not one 101 man has ever admitted to needing rescue. I have watched every interview from the soldiers, read the books, and also watched Band of Brothers. I even watched all the band of brothers interviews.

Perhaps I have a misunderstanding about Asov but my understanding is they are good, brave fighters who got pinned down in a steel factory and refused to surrender... I'm not saying they didn't suffer or didn't fight hard enough. Clearly they have. There are just better military, historical references than a blanket 101 comparison.  Probably more recent than my Sparta comparison but that's what I had pictured in my mind before the evacuation.

I have spent a lifetime learning about WWII. I spend each spring teaching my kids about the Canadian liberation of the Netherlands. Our heroes and what ""lest we forget"" truly means. For 30 years I have read, watched, and listened to everything and everything I could get my hands on.

I have watched these past few years in horror as I see so many similarities just before world war II. Just before February 24th I remember thinking I hope that they have secured the border and haven't made the same mistake that they made with Poland when Germany invaded 😔. Such a stupid advice telling Poland not to secure the border because it might antagonize the Germans...still I think they'd have blown through any defense. 

Azov may be idolized like the 101 but they are not otherwise comparable. 

I spend my days helping Ukrainian women and children resettle in Canada. Organizing donations and helping to find hosts. Many people who come to my city find a free place to live within hours of joining our local Ukrainian settlement group. So don't get me wrong. I support Ukraine and am doing my part to make sure the wives and children of defenders are looked after.  I just happen to disagree with your analogy.

Check Julian Assange's leakes about Turkish army AND inventory during 2016-17. In 2016, Turkey lost about 20 tanks (~10 Leopard 2 A4, ~10 M60-T ""Sabra"") to ISIS and PYD in Syria. Next year Turkey didn't use Leopard per Germany's request but the fights were harsher due to it being a fight at all sides. Turkey ""lost"" only one Sabra in 2017 because of turret barrel damage. Not to mention high ranking positions were purged just months before due to failed sectarian coup. This shows that Turkey is capable of adapting in short time. Something that Russia doesn't possess and why they get wrecked. Not to mention Turkey is much more experienced into adapting into unconventional warfare, even much more than Ukraine. Unconventional/conventional manuevers are extremely deadly. Another point is that the Turkish airforce and naval fleet is on high readiness at all times with tonnes of engagement experience in Syria. Turkey's army was fundamentally based on defending invasion from East, conducting small cross-border operations and partially invasion to West.

19-year-old KPI student Oleksandra Anikieva died at the front

19-year-old KPI student Oleksandra Anikieva died at the front
A 19-year-old student from Kyiv dreamed of becoming a book artist, but joined the Armed Forces and died for her homeland.

The photos of the Heroine were posted on Facebook by the Department of Printing Technology of VPI KPI named after I. Sikorsky. The girl wanted to be engaged in publishing as an art. And her photos carry the energy of happy student days. Now in May, Oleksandra might be preparing for the session and working on creative projects.

Oleksandra Anikyeva, a student of the I. Sikorsky KPI Publishing and Printing Institute, died on May 5, 2022 in the battles for Ukraine. Photo: Facebook
""Have you seen what an angel who came down to protect us looks like?"" - writes about Oleksandra Myroslava Perevalska, who taught her painting, took entrance exams, rejoiced in all her achievements…
""This is Sasha, she was only 19 years old…

She was born to live, to be happy, to be loved, to create beautiful…

Talented and fragile, tender and always smiling, that's how I will remember her… "", - her teacher shares her thoughts about student Anikieva with bitterness.

With the beginning of Russia's open armed aggression against Ukraine, Oleksandra went to defend the Motherland with weapons in her hands in the ranks of Ukraine's SRS, and later in the ranks of the Armed Forces.

More than two months of her life were between heaven and earth - with weapons in hand, in the battles for Ukraine. The fragile 19-year-old Alexandra was a marksman in the Armed Forces. And then there was a message from the staff of the Publishing and Printing Institute of KPI named after I. Sikorsky.

""The terrible news stunned the whole team: on May 5, 2022, a student of the SG-92 group Oleksandra Anikyeva died while serving in the Armed Forces,"" the teachers wrote.

She had a great life ahead of her for joy and dreams. But one dream turned out to be the strongest - to live in a free independent Ukraine. And for this dream, a young talented girl Alexander Anikiev paid with his life.

""Alexandra dreamed of becoming an artist of the book, to bring harmony and beauty to this world. But it happened differently: in her 19 prosperous years, she died defending the Motherland as a shooter of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, ”the institute's employees share their thoughts on the student. And bow to her courage and patriotism.

And Myroslava Perevalska, Oleksandra's painting teacher, admits that this girl became a teacher by and large for all adults, she showed a life example that only a few can do.

""She is a warrior of light!

Her path is light, love and strength!

We bow to you child, I'm sorry that we, adults, are alive, but you are not… »

-For once, lowering domestic expectations. These where raised sky high during the first view days. Going from the goal of conquering Kiev and Ukrainian capitulation to making minor territorial gains in Donbas needs to be sold to the population somehow.

-Shifting the blame from the politicians who started it (mainly Putin) to the obviously incompetent military. Not only did they fail to achieve their military objectives, but some of the losses have been to great to hide from the Russian public. This is quite embarrassing for a political elite that for years propagated their military as nearly unbeatable.

-Thirdly, trying to appear more reasonable in public could aim at western nations/ publics, hoping to further pressure on Ukraine to accept a peace deal with Russian territorial gains

In turn countries seeing that there is a place to send nuclear waste will start building nuclear power plants because countries will see that major problem related to waste disposal is addressed.

But on the topic of kicking Turkey out, and replacing them with Finns and Swedes... Combined, we do bring more on the table in military might than Turkey. Finland brings in it's military reserves of 900k people, and Sweden brings in one of the largest airforces in the world. 

Finland is famous for it's marksmen, camouflage, guerilla tactics and preparedness. Oh, and stubborness. And Swedes are famous for their air capabilities and readiness. 

As for strategic value... Well, Finland might look like a pleasant country full of lakes and forests, but in reality, it is actually just a finely camouflaged fortress of bunkers and bomb shelters, that is literally designed to stop any invasion force, or allow for endless guerilla warfare against an occupier...

Russian failures fuelled by Vladimir Putin’s meddling

The president and General Valery Gerasimov are accused of dictating basic troop movements

A source compared the micromanagement of President Putin and General Valery Gerasimov to that of the founder of Amazon, noting that “Jeff Bezos doesn’t deliver your parcels”

A source compared the micromanagement of President Putin and General Valery Gerasimov to that of the founder of Amazon, noting that “Jeff Bezos doesn’t deliver your parcels”

President Putin is making low-level tactical decisions that would normally be decided by an officer in charge of as few as 700 Russian troops, western military sources say.

A military source said that Putin and General Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff, were dictating basic movements of their forces in Ukraine.

“We think Putin and Gerasimov are involved in tactical decision-making at a level we would normally expect to be taken by a colonel or a brigadier”, the source said.

The T-90 example in question obviously burned up its ammunition, your claimed improved ""steel floor"" or no, after taking a hit.  And if you look closely at the six pictures of the carcass, you can detect that the turret ring gear even separated to a degree from the hull--a partial turret blow-off.

Assuming there even is *some* additional armor in theT-90's turret floor, it simply cannot be significantly thick and adequately protective against EFPs, given the huge amount of surface area the carousel magazine covers and the severely restrictive weight requirements every Russian tank must meet. 

And sure, the upright propellant canisters are a bit more exposed in the 64 and 80 than those in the 72 and 90.  But it's all combustible case, and it simply doesn't take too much more than a single blob of molten metal from a KE (or CE, especially) round to find or melt its way into the ammo carousel, touch it all off, and thus actuate the classic Russian tank self-kill mechanism.

I read somewhere that Uralvagonzavod nutzed around with adopting bustle storage like the M1-series for the T-90, which might've allowed them a means to similarly vent ammunition fires outside the tank and isolate the tank's interior from a brew up/uncontrolled disassembly.  But they opted to stay with the familiar carousel design, fatal flaw and all.  And that design decision is apparently coming home to roost with the T-90, just like it did with its predecessor tanks.",37e68ad27679c4de9f4c702f8446b19ddbbcd850,True,False,,,,,0,1652781848,,0,{},i8xfpml,False,t3_ur432o,False,True,t1_i8wlk0r,/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/ur432o/the_pride_of_russian_tank_building_t90m_destroyed/i8xfpml/,1652781860,1,False,True,False,RussiaUkraineWar2022,t5_5wptpp,r/RussiaUkraineWar2022,public,,0,[],,1652753048.0,,

We have high standards of living due to energy which is mainly due to fossil fuels. 

We want renewable energy? Well we need battery storage, which is limited by lithium.

We want to use nuclear? There are plenty of people protesting and always politics get in the way.

We want electric cars? Well they got to be affordable. Most people buy used cars, not new ones. Fix few issues and continue on driving them. Most wearing out part in electric car which is critical for car functioning? Batteries. These batteries are not what people who can allow to spend to fix 1k euros budget fixing a car can allow to replace.

Many of them a dreamers who are not willing to look at limitations or economical aspect of what they preach. It's good to have convictions, but you got to put work and money to resolve issues and waste less time of everybody's else's time. If issues can be resolved and if benefits do live up to expectations everybody will flock to those solutions regardless what others are saying.

Just an example in the past, before fridges/freezers there was ice business. Huge amounts of ice were shipped and used for refrigeration. But the moment fridges appeared and they were affordable, no amount of money helped that ice business to hold on with their ads, because fridges were affordable and far more practical.

So this is the issue with greens. Instead of doing what matters so that green energy would be more practical and economical it's mostly talk.

But you are right, they overarchieved: especially ""Fall Blau"" went better than expected. 

Dunkirk was a political decision (Göring wanted the Luftwaffe to win it) and a bad one. The supply issues started with the eastern front, and the international sanctions. 

I would say, that the German Army was extremely potent at the time, but the Task the political leadership asked them to do wasnt archievable. Add the Nazi ideology of superiority into the mix and suddenly the Evaluation what is doable gets wrong very fast.

Also, again biased, comparing Russia to literally any country rn is far worse than apples to oranges. No one is innocent here. Worst one in the room LITERALLY ALWAYS RUSSIA. Between murdering their own troops, raping hostages including children, and threatening to drop nukes on literally every country providing support for the bullied Ukraine, any hatred spurred towards that shithole is well deserved. They are the aggressor, regardless of your beliefs, Ukraine simply existing within close proximity to a neighboring country with opposing beliefs on freedom and liberty, does not make Ukraine aggressive. Ukraine did nothing to cause this. Fuck any Ruski outlet that says otherwise. 

Additionally you must request to join NATO. They dont petition you to join. Theyve actually stalled their entrance for some time now. If anything that is a desire for a Nuclear Umbrella on behalf of Ukraine BECAUSE its neighbor likes to shake its dick at everyone around them with blatent 0-100 MAD threats. 

Traditionally speaking Russian diplomacy isnt exactly motivated by morals or rooted in valuing human life. Theres been more sabre-rattling by the Russians than the North Koreans and the Syrians combined in the last year.
