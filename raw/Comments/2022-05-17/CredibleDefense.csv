I say meaningful because when seen through Indian eyes, these two issues are critical and any positive move made by the PRC in this regard would be noted in India as being so.

These, however, are dangerous options for the PRC because (1) settling the border dispute means putting and end to an issue that can be raked up and calibrated at will by the PRC, which it has done for domestic and international purposes time and again, and (2) withdrawing opposition to India's entry into the UNSC could also prove to be highly counterproductive because then India would have a veto that it can exercise - either individually or in concert with the US - over Chinese actions.

So, while I am not sure I would think of this as the PRC being ""incapable"" of making concessions or accommodating India, it certainly is a strategic conundrum for the PRC. Why? Because as the article (which is excellent, btw) points out, Chinese strategists remain aware that their ability to thwart the rise of India is fast diminishing and that aside from engaging India in some kind of a major war (which is very unlikely), there is no way they can keep India subjugated either economically or politically.

It boils down to the fact that as India grows economically it will become more assertive and think greater influence in south Asia and the Indian Ocean. India seeking a greater role is almost 100% likely as every major power wants a more secure environment. Indian expansion will inevitably come into conflict with Chinese interests, so getting closer to india is never a long term solution. Thus the Chinese never really gave an honest effort to become allies. 

In addition China realizes that the easiest time to check Indian power is sooner rather then later, hence the current Chinese expansion of influence in the Indian Ocean region. 

But either way, China will never try to fully cut off India or end relations. It does recognize there are great benefits to cooperation. It also does beleive there will be an inevitable limit to US cooperation due to religous conflicts, Indias desire to emulate China's development process through sucking up tech transfers, and the fact that the US already has power projection in the Indian Ocean. India would be great to have but either way the 7th and 5th fleets exist and can already seriously damage Chinese shipping in an all out conflict.

If Ukraine successfully breaks the Izyum theatre and ends the threat to the Donbass, something similar might happen - ceasefire with low intensity skirmishes in the future.

Or, the most likely case, is both sides eventually suffers so much attrition that fighting just fizzles out either with or without an official ceasefire like the Sino Vietnamese war - Russia declares it has liberated the Russians and Ukraine declares it has fended off the invaders, and things just kind of end without ending. Russia will likely withdraw from the most vulnerable positions to a developed line.

No, it's NOT to stop Russian tanks, it's a dismounted infantry antiarmor weapon system designed to kill any AFV at extended ranges beyond the close range done with shoulder fired AT weapons. In fact, since we didn't replace our old as fuck AT4 we're more reliant then ever on using the Javelin.

There is NOTHING in the US inventory that I'm aware of purely designed to fight Russians.

&gt;it’s not really cost effective against fixed emplacements

Compared to what? Calling in an air strike dropping JDAMs? I'll tell you what, it's a hell of a lot cheaper to use ATGM to take out a fixed position than with an infantry squad assault. Brits used their ATGM to great effect in the Falklands taking out bunkers, so did US in Iraq and Afghanistan. Often it's as good as a tank, which often aren't present.

&gt;And the tube is a weapons system that is near obsolete

The ""tube"" is the missile, and if you think they're so useless then Ukraine doesn't need them, we can give them more wunderwaffen M777 with dumb arty rounds.

&gt;Could you shoot down an isis drone yes, but many other systems can do that and the us does not intend to operate without air superiority anytime soon.

What other SHORAD and MANPADS does the US Army have? Crickets sound because Stinger is our only one. Or are you suggesting US troops use our fucking rifles when we go to war to shoot down enemy aircraft so you can virtue signal Slava Ukraini?

&gt;That’s why production has been all but halted for the past decade

Growing air defense issues exposed in the last decade plus since ""near peer"" has been a focus, numerous SHORAD combat vehicles were added to MTOE, all using Stingers. New Stingers weren't made because someone stupidly decided we had enough for the time being until a new missile could be designed and implemented, typically a ten year procurement project assuming it even succeeds. Now that terrible decision is shit canned so we're left with current dwindling stockpile that gets smaller every month because it's going to take two years to rebuild the capacity to produce more.

If any of this stuff was as useless as you think it is for the US, why do the Ukrainians need it? Let's give them 10x F16s and wipe our hands, and if Zelensky gets mad you can explain to him how they don't need ATGMs and MANPADS as long as they have air support, lol.",330b9520b0c8e154e5279643a478cc88520b8d66,True,False,,,,,0,1652824332,,0,{},i8zzuoi,False,t3_urktur,False,True,t1_i8ztlbe,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/urktur/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_17_2022/i8zzuoi/,1652824347,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652795532.0,

---------------

&gt; * The “Western way of war” (TWOW) is a concept that was most notably defined by the historian Victor Davis Hanson who viewed the Ancient Greeks and their form of decisive infantry battle as the wellspring of a unique Western tradition. It is an ideal of well drilled citizen-soldiers able to defeat the enemy in a decisive battle, with a clear distinction between war and peace in a free society. Central to this tradition of Western warfare is the idea that consensual governments are able to make use of direct force to overcome an adversary in a clear emphatic manner. The “shock and awe” and lethality of TWOW, with its reliance on better technology and decisive overwhelming force stands in contrast to the ambushes, skirmishes, or individual combat that are viewed as uncharacteristic of liberal Western states.

&gt; * Crucially, there is also increased concern that the ‘dragons and the snakes’ of non-Western powers have learned to overcome the Western advantages and approach to warfare. 

&gt; * Uniting these concerns of a Western way of war in decline is the fear that the West’s military dominance is under threat and that rival powers will not play by the rules in seeking direct confrontation.

&gt; * Contrasting a rational West with focused overwhelming power against an irrational East reliant on cunning and deception creates ahistorical arguments based on questionable assumptions. The notion that the West fights in a distinct manner also raises troubling stereotypes, cliches, and is open to critiques of orientalism, as the following explains.

&gt; * It is Thucydides’ famous statement on the causes of the Peloponnesian war arising from the growing power of Athens and the fear this causes in Sparta, which has been summarized as the “Thucydides trap”. Ancient Greek history is therefore used to portray the US-China relationship as heading on a railroad to war. But the Greek speaking Byzantines faced their own great power rivalry with the Sasanid Persians. The Byzantine-Sasanid clash of empires was not a story of a rising and declining power leading to a great power war, but a more complicated story of a 400-year-old rivalry that saw the two sides develop a buffer zone between them across Mesopotamia.

&gt; * The competition between these two empires created a system of two divided spheres of interests, which the Persian King referred to as the “two eyes” of the Earth. The division of the world into two competing visions of international order is a realistic possibility for today. The Thucydides trap presents an air of inevitability, but it is just as possible that the US and China will equally seek to create spheres of interest. 

&gt; * TWOW builds upon a simplistic approach of essentialist cultural differences. The history of Byzantine warfare presents a more complicated picture which unsettles the idea of a distinct Western approach to war.  TWOW is a hubristic and historically flawed concept which needs to be left behind.

That exacerbates a lack of basic military skills like navigation and shooting, although the air force did maintain flight safety standards.

“It is impossible to imagine the scale of lies inside the military,” Mr. Irisov said. “The quality of military production is very low because of the race to steal money.”

One out of every five rubles spent on the armed forces was stolen, the chief military prosecutor, Sergey Fridinsky, told Rossiyskaya Gazeta, the official government newspaper, in 2011.

Mr. Irisov said he had encountered numerous examples of subpar equipment — the vaunted Pantsir air defense system unable to shoot down a small Israeli drone over Syria; Russian-made light bulbs on the wings of SU-35 warplanes melting at supersonic speeds; new trucks breaking down after two years.

In general, Russian weaponry lags behind its computerized Western counterparts, but it is serviceable, military analysts said. Still, some new production has been limited.

For example, the T-14 Armata, a “next generation” battle tank unveiled in 2015, has not been deployed in Ukraine because there are so few, they said.

Russia has poured hundreds of billions of dollars into its military, producing under the State Armament Program a stream of new airplanes, tanks, helicopters and other matériel. Military spending has not dipped below 3.5 percent of gross domestic product for much of the past decade, according to figures from the International Institute for Strategic Studies, at a time when most European nations struggled to invest 2 percent of G.D.P. And that is only the public portion of Russia’s military budget.

This kind of financial investment has helped Russia make what gains it has in Ukraine.

Johan Norberg, a Russia analyst at the Swedish Defense Research Agency, said Russia and its military are too sprawling to expect them to fix every problem, even in a decade. The war in Ukraine exposed the fact that the Russian military is “not 10 feet tall, but they are not two feet tall, either,” he said.

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/16/world/europe/russia-military-ukraine.html

Army vehicles were so decrepit that repair crews were stationed roughly every 15 miles. Some officers were so out of shape that the military budgeted $1.5 million to re-size standard uniforms.

That was the Russian military more than a decade ago when the country invaded Georgia, according to the defense minister at the time. The shortcomings, big and small, were glaring enough that the Kremlin announced a complete overhaul of the military to build a leaner, more flexible, professional force.

But now, almost three months into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it is clear the Kremlin fell woefully short of creating an effective fighting machine. Russian forces in Ukraine have underperformed to a degree that has surprised most Western analysts, raising the prospect that President Vladimir V. Putin’s military operation could end in failure.

By any measure, despite capturing territory in the south and east, the Russian military has suffered a major blow in Ukraine. It has been forced to abandon what it expected would be a blitzkrieg to seize the entire country in a few days. Its forces were driven from around Kyiv, the capital. The flagship of its Black Sea fleet, the Moskva, was sunk; it has never controlled the skies; and by some Western estimates, tens of thousands of Russians have died.

This war has exposed the fact that, to Russia’s detriment, much of the military culture and learned behavior of the Soviet era endures: inflexibility in command structure, corruption in military spending, and concealing casualty figures and repeating the mantra that everything is going according to plan.

The signs of trouble were hiding in plain sight. Just last summer, Russia held war games that the Ministry of Defense said showed its ability to coordinate a deployment of 200,000 men from different branches of the military in a mock effort to combat NATO. They would be among the largest military exercises ever, it said.

Lt. General Yunus-Bek Evkunov, the deputy defense minister, told reporters the exercises demonstrated Russia’s ability to rapidly deploy joint forces in a manner that would “make sober any enemy.”

The whole exercise was scripted. There was no opposing force; the main units involved had practiced their choreography for months; and each exercise started and stopped at a fixed time. The number of troops participating was probably half the number advertised, military analysts said.

“It is the Soviet army, basically,” said Kamil Galeev, an independent Russian analyst and former fellow at The Wilson Center in Washington. “The reforms increased the efficiency of the army, but they only went halfway.”

When, after the Georgia conflict in 2008, Russia tried to revamp its military, the idea was to jettison the rigidly centralized, Soviet-era army that could supposedly muster four million troops in no time. Instead, field officers would get more responsibility, units would learn to synchronize their skills and the entire arsenal would be dragged into the computer age.

Many traditionalists resisted change, preferring the old model of a huge, concentrated force. But other factors also contributed to the military’s inability to transform. Birthrates plunged in the 1990s, leading to a shrinking pool of men that could be conscripted. That, and persistent low salaries, delayed recruitment targets. Endemic corruption handicapped the efforts.

But the basic problem was that the military culture of the Soviet Union endured, despite the lack of men and means to sustain it, analysts said.

“The Soviet military was built to generate millions of men to fill lots and lots of divisions that had endless stockpiles of equipment,” said Michael Kofman, the director of Russia studies at CNA, a research institute in Arlington, Va. “It was designed for World War III, the war with NATO that never came.”

Ultimately, the push for change stalled, leaving a hybrid version of the military somewhere between mass mobilization and a more flexible force, analysts said. It still favors substantial artillery over infantry troops who can take and hold land.

The scripted way the military practices warfare, on display in last summer’s exercises, is telling. “Nobody is being tested on their ability to think on the battlefield,” said William Alberque, the Berlin-based director of the arms control program at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Instead, officers are assessed on their ability to follow instructions, he said.

Russia would like the world to view its army as it appears during the annual Victory Day parade — a well-oiled instrument of fit soldiers in dashing uniforms marching in unison and bristling with menacing weapons.

“They use the military forces as a propaganda machine,” said Gleb Irisov, 31, a former air force lieutenant who left the military in 2020 after five years. He then worked as a military analyst for the official TASS news agency before quitting and leaving the country because he strongly opposed the invasion.

Senior military commanders argue that recent expeditionary forces, especially in Syria, provided real combat training, but analysts call that claim inflated.

Russian troops faced no real adversary in Syria; the war was mostly an air force operation where the pilots could hover over targets at will. Russia has not fought a large land war since World War II.

Yet Russia’s leaders exaggerated the country’s success. In 2017, Sergei K. Shoigu, Russia’s defense minister, bragged at a meeting of fellow ministers in the Philippines that Russia had “liberated” 503,223 square kilometers in Syria. The problem is that the area Mr. Shoigu claimed to have freed from militants is more than twice the size of the entire country, reported Proekt, an independent news outlet.

With about 900,000 people overall, a little over one third of them ground forces, the Russian military is not that large, considering that it must defend a vast country covering 11 time zones, analysts said. But the goal of recruiting 50,000 contract soldiers every year, first stated a decade ago, has not been met, so there is still a yearly draft of 18- to 27-year-olds.

In Mariupol. The bloodiest battle of the war in Ukraine ended in Mariupol, as the Ukrainian military ordered fighters holed up at a steel plant in the city to surrender. Ukraine’s decision to end combat gave Moscow full control over a vast sweep of southern Ukraine, stretching from the Russian border to Crimea.

Peace talks. After weeks of trying to hammer out a deal, peace talks between Russia and Ukraine have collapsed, amid public recriminations and intransigence on boths sides.

NATO’s show of strength. Although planned before the invasion of Ukraine, NATO held a large military exercise on Russia’s doorstep in Estonia. The drills come as Finland and Sweden confirmed that they would cast aside decades of strategic neutrality and apply for membership in the alliance.

McDonald’s plans to leave Russia. After 32 years in Russia, McDonald’s has put its Russia business up for sale as it works to leave the country completely. The move makes McDonald’s the latest of many Western companies to unwind their investments, close stores and pause sales in Russia.

Mr. Putin has not resorted to a mass military draft that would muster all able-bodied adult males for the war. But even if he did, the infrastructure required to train civilians en masse no longer exists. The consensus is that the bulk of Russia’s available ground forces have already been deployed in Ukraine.

Rampant corruption has drained resources. “Each person steals as much of the allocated funds as is appropriate for their rank,” said retired Maj. Gen. Harri Ohra-Aho, the former Chief of Intelligence in Finland and still a Ministry of Defense adviser.

The corruption is so widespread that some cases inevitably land in court.

In January, Col. Evgeny Pustovoy, the former head of the procurement department for armored vehicles, was accused of helping to steal more than $13 million by faking contracts for batteries from 2018 to 2020, according to TASS.

In February, a Moscow military court stripped Maj. Gen. Alexander Ogloblin of his rank and sentenced him to 4.5 years in prison for what the charges called fraud on an “especially large scale.” The authorities accused him of embezzling about $25 million by vastly overstating the expenses in state contracts for satellite and other equipment, the business news website BFM.RU reported.

Huge contracts are not the only temptation. The combination of low salaries — a senior officer earns roughly $1,000 per month — and swelling budgets is a recipe for all sorts of theft, analysts said, leading to a chain reaction of problems.",1abf10830cba817cb941455ce5e4baec39b4e633,True,False,,,,,0,1652818751,,0,{},i8zmnwl,False,t3_urktur,False,True,t3_urktur,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/urktur/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_17_2022/i8zmnwl/,1652818764,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652789951.0,

[],False,,Xyzzyzzyzzy,,,[],,,,text,t2_6qgej2g0,False,False,"I think the days of the tank as the king of the battlefield are over. As we're seeing in Ukraine, tanks face a variety of threats on the modern battlefield. They can't operate alone, or even with some supportive light infantry. You can probably assume that enemy platoon has an organic tank-destroying capability that can fire from a distance, accurately and with high lethality. There is a proliferation of longer-range options as well: loitering munitions like the Switchblade 600 (man-portable, 40km range), fire-and-forget missiles like Brimstone that can autonomously find and engage targets (ground or air launched, ranges from 12km to 60+km depending on variant and launch platform), mortar- and cannon-launched guided projectiles like M712 Copperhead, SMArt 155 and Krasnopol, and the usual dizzying array of air ground-attack platforms.

""Of course tanks need protection from anti-tank weapons - they should be used in combined arms operations!"" Fair enough. So if you want your tanks to sit on some patch of land, you have to take it, clear it of infantry and mines, be able to detect and engage dismounted infantry and light vehicles at ranges from hundreds of meters to dozens of kilometers, and have anti-missile active protection and anti-air capabilities against both small/low/slow targets like drones and large/high/fast targets like fighters. If you want to achieve the things you'd traditionally use tanks to achieve - breakthrough and deep maneuver - all of these capabilities need to be at least as mobile as a tank, and have enough survivability to maneuver in the combat conditions you'd want tanks to maneuver in.

Which raises the question - if you can do all that as a prerequisite to employing tanks, **what do you need the tanks for?** They seem redundant. They're left with the specialist role of direct fire in support of dismounted infantry, something more like the WW2 assault gun concept, except more niche because modern artillery is much more accurate than WW2 artillery, and artillery is always going to be cheaper and more effective than armor, so you'd only want to employ tanks if you specifically need *direct* fire.

I guess you could try to fit ""all of the above"" into one heavily armored package and call it a tank.

This is is the US Army and US Marine Corps' standard 155mm High Explosive (HE) projectile for howitzers, which came to replace the M107 projectile. It is a bursting round with fragmentation and blast effects. The M795 is designed to be a more lethal, longer range version of the M107. A welded band replaces the swaged rotating band of the M107, allowing the M795 to be fired with M119 or M203 propelling charges, increasing range by 6,000 metres (6.0 km; 3.7 mi). The explosive payload was also improved (*edit: 10.8 kilograms of explosives - I'm adding this in because the article didn't include it), as was the fragmentation pattern, giving 30% higher lethality.

&gt; To understand the difference, it should be noted that in Soviet 152.4 mm projectile, used by enemy artillery, the weight of the explosive varies from 4.8 kg to 6.8 kg. Therefore, the firepower of one M795 projectile is 1.5-2 times greater than the firepower of 152.4 mm Soviet artillery projectiles.

Don't forget about the fuses. I believe a lot of the old Soviet stuff they were using was contact triggered. NATO is sending stuff that can be airburst to improve lethality.

&gt; * China sees Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine through the lens of great power competition between itself and the US. Beijing’s obsession with the US explains not only its position on the Ukraine war, but also its overall strategic intent towards Europe, as well as its short- and medium-term relationship with Russia.

&gt; * While it has been entirely justified to demand that China, as a UN Security Council Member, does everything in its power to end the war in Ukraine, Europe seem to misunderstand – or disregard – how Beijing sees the war and its geostrategic position, including its view that the EU and its member states form the weak link in the transatlantic alliance.

&gt; * The Chinese leadership appears to be calculating that by holding the US responsible for the war, it can drive a wedge through the transatlantic alliance and portray Europeans as simple puppets of US hegemony.

&gt; * Despite Beijing’s vocal support for European strategic autonomy – which for China means autonomy from the US – a disunited and weak Europe is in China’s interests.

&gt; * Beijing prefers a 'Merkelian' Europe where trade relations trump politics, and especially values such as human rights.

&gt; * A stable relationship with Russia allows China to divert its attention elsewhere.

&gt; * With each day that the war goes on, China gains more leverage over Russia. It keeps demonstrating its support through heavy internal propaganda, backed by eager netizens voicing their anger against the US. 

&gt; * A protracted war will have an impact on Western economies, and Beijing calculates that it is only a matter of time before Europeans grow anxious about rising inflation and energy prices, which could result in diminishing solidarity towards Ukraine and eventually disrupt Western unity.",9894676cd8782588cf6afedeaa559115942bdb49,True,False,,,,,0,1652805890,,0,{},i8yr1px,False,t3_urktur,False,True,t3_urktur,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/urktur/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_17_2022/i8yr1px/,1652805903,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652777090.0,

I think this is a little too early to call.

As a starter, deepl translation of [German Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Vad#%C3%84u%C3%9Ferungen_zum_Krieg_Russlands_in_der_Ukraine) – basically taking the wrong position on every issue since February:

&gt;On Feb. 24, 2022, during a special broadcast of the political talk show Maybrit Illner, Vad said of the prospects for resisting the invasion, ""Militarily, it's a done deal. And my assessment is that it will only be a matter of a few days and no more."" However, he said, this only applies if Putin ""does not make the move into western Ukraine."" Then, he said, ""massive resistance can be expected."" In that case, there could be a protracted ""Afghanistan-style guerrilla war.""\[11\]  
&gt;  
&gt;In early March 2022, Vad expressed that, in perspective, there was no prospect for Ukrainian troops to permanently prevail against Russian troops. From a military perspective, he said, it made more sense to ""draw Ukrainian resistance to western Ukraine,"" where supplies were easier. Fighting for cities like Kiev would be purely symbolic. The Russian strategy in the Ukraine war, he said, is to encircle major urban centers and let out many fugitives. ""The Russians are going into these cities selectively to neutralize buildings important to the government, military infastructure."" This, he said, was the Russians' strategy, which they were also taking their time with.\[12\]  
&gt;  
&gt;In April 2022, Vad assumed that the destruction of the Mariupol maternity hospital ""was not Putin's intention,"" and compared the deaths of civilians in the Ukrainian war to wars such as in Iraq, Libya, and Afghanistan, where there is always so-called collateral damage.\[13\]\[14\]  
&gt;  
&gt;After his miscalculation on the start of the attack, he conceded, ""The Ukrainians have proven that they have effectively defended their capital Kiev and, moreover, are waging a successful defensive struggle against a superior adversary. The Russians, in turn, have made some land gains in the east and on the Black Sea coast.""\[15\] He therefore considered a ""face-saving"" solution by both sides in the Ukraine conflict possible. He opposed the delivery of heavy weapons. These, he said, were potentially a ""path to World War III."" Moreover, systems such as the Leopard main battle tank or the Marder infantry fighting vehicle could only be used profitably after years of training.\[16\]

&gt; With Vladimir Putin's unprovoked attack against Ukraine, political analysts are now reassessing the long and deeply complicated relationship the Russian leader had with ex-German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and how Moscow came to hold so much sway over the rest of Europe.
&gt;
&gt;The former German leader was known for speaking Russian and keeping diplomatic ties with Putin. It was also during her term that Germany stepped up its energy links to Moscow and kept its national defense spending to a minimum.
&gt;
&gt;But, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has now led to a dramatic shift in German politics.
&gt;
&gt;New Chancellor Olaf Scholz's ""forceful policy shifts is a firm repudiation of the core of Merkel's foreign economic policy,"" Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund think tank, told CNBC via email.
&gt;
&gt;""Germany's foreign economic policy is no longer predicated on 'Russia being a stability oriented actor,' but instead an aggressive imperialist power,"" Kirkegaard added.
&gt;
&gt;Scholz announced a halt on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline after Russia's first military moves into two breakaway regions of Ukraine in late February. Nord Stream 2, which started being built in 2018 during Merkel's chancellorship, is seen as a controversial project which was meant to bring additional gas from Russia to Germany via the Baltic Sea, circumnavigating counties like Ukraine and Poland.",3eb9f283fcd860053a95c3d268490cbaacd3fb49,True,False,,,,,0,1652793366,,0,{},i8xxt94,False,t3_urktur,False,False,t1_i8xx732,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/urktur/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_17_2022/i8xxt94/,1652793401,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652764566.0,

[],False,,MarshalWillKane,,,[],,,,text,t2_dla6h,False,False,"I was interested in this paper as it has some background on what the thinking was inside China before the conflict flared up in Galwan, and many soldiers lost their lives. Of course for the leadership in China is hard to get solid background on what the thinking was, but there are open source think tanks and strategic thinkers in China just like anywhere else. 

From reading the paper it appears to me that what predicated the Galwan incident is likely a form of punishment towards India by China for being unhelpful and acting as a counter to China, and to enforce its dominance over India. This reminds me of the background to the Sino-Vietnamese war where the entire thing was a hamfisted attempt at punishing Vietnam for not respecting Chinese hegemony in the region, and the actual operational and tactical matters of the war were irrelevant as the war itself was a punishment inflicted on Vietnam.

----------

&gt; * Much of the existing discourse is unable to provide a complete picture of or explanation for the development. However, a closer look at China’s domestic debates and discussions on India in the years preceding the Galwan clash and thereafter provides a clear and comprehensive understanding of the circumstances that might have led to the border crisis and also offers clues on the way forward. 

&gt; * …this paper makes two key arguments: first, the border standoff in Ladakh is likely the outcome of an intensifying conflict between two Chinese strategies towards India— its Major Power Diplomacy (of wooing India to hedge against the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy and making it a key partner in the Belt and Road Initiative) and its Neighborhood Strategy (of securing a China-centered regional order with Beijing as the sole leader or rule-maker in the region). 

&gt; * Second, the standoff reveals China’s policy dilemma over India — on the one hand, Beijing wants to effectively check a rising New Delhi by asserting its strength and psychological advantage in bilateral ties. But on the other hand, China is anxious about the impact of the current crisis on the realization of its various regional and global objectives in the Indian Ocean Region that necessitates cordial ties with India. 

&gt; * In the end, the lesson for India is to look beyond the lens of the power differential between the two Asian giants when dealing with China. New Delhi should come to terms with the fact that it has leverage with China due to its increasing strategic value to Beijing, whether in the realm of China’s foreign policy or its development strategies, and utilize it to shape Beijing’s behavior and extract benefits from it.

&gt; * However, downplaying the Indo-Pacific at the official level belied the alarm and attention China accorded to the concept internally.

&gt; * At the military level, the Indo-Pacific strategy was seen as potentially targeting the “going out” strategy of the Chinese Navy and a ploy to block China’s access to the seas by creating a second island chain.

&gt; * In the political and economic realms, Chinese analysts saw FOIP as a way to challenge China’s BRI, deter Chinese industrial upgradation, attack its development model, and threaten its energy lifeline.

&gt; * Ambassador Yuan Nansheng, who once served as Chinese Consul General in Mumbai, agreed. “Among all the big powers, India does have the capability to balance China. Given its geographic location and its military strength (particularly having more than one aircraft carrier), it does have the ability to block the Strait of Malacca,”29 he argued. 

&gt; * But despite many convergences in interest, a U.S.-India alliance was not seen as inevitable by Chinese strategists. They believed that India remained the weakest link of the Indo-Pacific grouping or the Quad (which many Chinese strategists refer to as a three-plus one31 and not a quadrilateral) because of New Delhi’s own “great power complex(大国情结),”32 its unwillingness to be subservient to the United States, and the complicated history of U.S.-India relations. Therefore, in the Chinese conception, India has been the “key variable” ( 关键变量)33 which would determine the success or failure of the Indo-Pacific strategy34 as “without India, there is no Indo-Pacific.”35

&gt; * In other words, what the Chinese side had hoped for was an association with India that facilitated or guaranteed the rise of a China-led economic and political regional order in Asia and that eliminated U.S. interference from the region surrounding China, oft-considered the first crucial step towards China attaining global dominance.56 However, in actuality, they were displeased to see that at the global level, India and the United States were getting closer under the Indo-Pacific framework, particularly in the realm of defense cooperation, and the Quad was making steady progress. 

&gt; * It was becoming clear that China’s Major Power Strategy was increasingly in tension with its Neighborhood Strategy. 

&gt; * The key allegations leveled against India by these strategists were that India had been taking advantage of intensified Sino-U.S. competition to fuel its own rise, taking opportunistic and pragmatic diplomatic actions to overtake China, and continuously sending strong confrontational signals on issues involving Beijing’s core interests.

&gt; * Meanwhile, they argued, China’s restraint at the LAC, out of its concern over an imminent India-United States rapprochement, was proving counterproductive. It has further emboldened India, which has now become more confident to pressure China on various issues in a cost-effective way and simultaneously bargain with the United States on advanced weapons, technology, security guarantees, and whatever else required to enhance its own strength vis-a-vis China.67

&gt; * China needed to reassert its strength advantage and force India to accept Chinese superiority through committed actions.68

&gt; * The sheer magnitude of the Galwan incident, the high number of casualities, an unprecedented level of perceived escalation by India, and the global attention around the development caused much unease within Chinese strategic circles.

&gt; * He was also critical of Beijing’s India policy still being managed at a comparatively lower level in terms of policy/military planning, thereby exhibiting a tactical, reactive, tit-for-tat nature, without a substantial strategic intent. This, he warned, was counterproductive for China as it stoke nationalism in India and might eventually draw China into an untimely military conflict.

&gt; * …if there is a military conflict between China and India in the current international environment, regardless of which side wins, it would lead to the actual realization of the Indo-Pacific strategy. 

&gt; * As evidenced above, the ongoing China-India border standoff is not an ordinary, sporadic confrontation but the manifestation of an intensifying conflict between China’s Major Power Diplomacy (of wooing India to hedge against the U.S. FOIP strategy and making New Delhi a key partner in the BRI) and its Neighborhood Strategy (that of securing a China-centered regional order with Beijing as the sole leader or rule-maker in the region) vis-à-vis India.

&gt; * But to solicit this Indian cooperation, China is unwilling to pay a strategic cost or make any real tradeoff, such as accommodating India’s concerns or aspirations on the disputed border or South Asia or concerning its membership of international organizations. That is likely because deep down, China recognizes India as a key threat that can intercept its energy lifelines, has the potential to replace it in global supply chains, and can compete with China in various international bodies, thereby challenging China’s ability to achieve an “overwhelming power advantage in Asia.” One of China’s key concerns is: “what if India manages to get these concessions from China, but still chooses to cooperate with the United States?”91

&gt; * The key idea is to strike a new balance or equilibrium: where through “controlled conflicts” at the disputed border, a “rising and confident” India is brought under check, and China’s strength and psychological advantage in bilateral ties are restored. But at the same time, escalation of tensions or a full-scale conflict is carefully averted so that the United States, whom China considers its principal adversary, does not get to reap a “fisherman’s benefit”92 from the situation.93

Jokes aside I see two main paths.

""Ukrain wins"". The EU doesnt fold, the western coalition wins the diplomatic war (could be that Somalia is also about this?) and provides the EU with alternate energy sources. Political and voters synpathy remain strong (finding out some bigger then Bucha mass killings would help. It is sure there are a few mass graves, Ukraine would need to secure and show them) and EU forces its resisting members (cough, hun*cough*gary) one way or another. Sanctions are getting stringer and neutral countries join in as well.

Russia would start to lose ground, army units retreat, disolve or straight up surrender. Donbas and Luhansk is retaken and Crimea is blockaded with its bridge in striking distance by Ukraine Armed Forces. While maybe internal power struggle and more likely economic sanctions starts to take effect. Russia runs out of currency reserves and shit starts to collapse

They use this to reach an agreement. (Crimea can beling to Russia, Ukraine provider water, national waters belong to Ukraine mostly for the oil there, but Russia can have its strategic shipyard/dock, Donbass is reintegrated and resources are being mined with EU help. Ukrain corruption decrease significantly, national unity is an all time high, political agreements with oligarchs are made and free/capitalist race begins with western founds. All is looking good, Crimea can be oblitareted with a missle barrage if needed.)

""Russia wins"". The EU's public opinion degrades. Sanctions are circumnavigated. US, UK, Poland and the Baltics still support Ukraine but the broader world just doesnt care.

Ukraine army is unable to launch counter offensive or if it does, it is broken. The land bridge is secured and while russian losses are high in both man and material, they grind Ukrainian defense down while sabotage in the country grows. A suprise strike to transistrina is lunched, but it does not reach it (so it doesnt escalete) but Odessa and other cities are sieged. New People's super free and democratic republics are created and federated to russia. UN doesnt accept, but that changes nothing. When US deems that it bleed russia long enough, its starts to withdraw support and Ukraine is forced to come to an agreement. At this point, east from the Dnipper, is ""warlords land"", the coastal areas and Donbass is somewhat secured and Russia starts to organize and mine the region.",db5bff0b307f8e5096e4fbbc549310a6c897fa87,True,False,,,,,0,1652791238,,0,{},i8xtogn,False,t3_urktur,False,True,t1_i8xqjel,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/urktur/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_17_2022/i8xtogn/,1652791251,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652762438.0,

The civil war in Syria started because Assad's corruption and mismanagment led to large desertification of Sunni arable land when it was coupled with draughts it has caused massive starvation among the Sunnis. Assad hardly lifted a finger in help and Iran sent nothing but weapons, while the west you keep blaming poured millions in food.

It was Assad massacring the protesters about said starvation that led to the civil war, not the west.

Your analysis is exactly blaming NATO for the war in Ukraine. You're blaming the west for mass starvation and Assad's massacres and torture of children.

Yes, Russia supporting a dictator in the massacres of hundreds of thousands of civilians. Ethnic cleansing and massacres of entire villages, torture and execution of tens of thousands of civilians, intentionally bombing civilians, blockadnig and  starving entire towns and using chemical weapons against civilians is orders of magnitude worse than the worst the US did in Iraq.

You seem to think being a dictator grants you unlimited rights to abuse your own population in the most gruesome ways. You must have supported the Saudi blockade of Yemen in support of the government of a soverign state just as much, right?

&gt;By this logic NATO is waging war on russia directly

False, the US does not control Ukraine. Zelenaki did not swear fealthy to Biden, the Ukrainian armed forces were not created by the US and do not claim to fight for the US. The Jihadists Iran used to attack the US are organizations directly under Iranian command and were formed by Iran.

Suleimani was not an enemy leader, he was an enemy soldier, conducting an operation in attack against US forces. Killing enemy soldiers during their military actions against yourself is exactly what you do.

&gt; I've been extremely critical of the American inability to build partnerships in the global south and Asia in the past. It seems this trend is going to continue.

We don't (huge generalisation) respect the global south. They're poor so they're irrelevant. The only partnerships anyone western has built in africa are ones for oil extraction. Post empire we basically just ignored them. The only relationships we build are charity projects to eradicate disease....

The EU has a trade policy called 'Anything but arms' (a noble one that i support) which allows tariff free exports from the world's 100 poorest countries, but when you take a step back and think about that... They're not engaging directly with those countries in any meaningful way. They just lump them all into one big group of 'the poors' and unilaterally allow them access. I think this kinda sums up our relationship with the global south.

China has spent 50 years actually treating them like people and building relationships and investing. Now we're finally starting to shit the bed as we realise that actually that's a whole shitton of people and resources.

This is normal and understandable. After all, who does not want to be joined to their brethren and to make common purpose with them?

We must complete our recovery from the embers of dead empires in a way that does not plunge us back into new forms of domination and oppression.

Crimea was Putin's consolation prize after losing his puppet with Yanukovych and this war was about righting the wrong Ukrainians did to him in 2014 by rejecting His Greatness. There's a measure of truth that NATO membership is a factor driving Putin's decision-making, but only insofar as it forever puts that nation out of Putin's reach.
&gt; 
&gt; With all the talk about IR gamesmanship acting as a smokescreen disguising his moves as a masterstroke of international game theory, I think the simplest explanation in this case is the correct one. Finland's membership means another neighboring state that Putin can't extort or bully, but he's in no position to do anything about it. They can violate Finland's airspace a few more times and maybe shut down some banking websites for an afternoon with cyber attacks, but they just look silly making military threats that the entire world knows they won't and can't make good on. So even though their muted response to Finland joining NATO is a glaring inconsistency with their previous rhetoric on Ukraine, they've calculated that contradiction is less embarrassing than continuing to impotently whine.

For instance, in 2008 Olmert offered Abbas a full Israeli withdrawal from 95% of the WB, the remaining 5% to be given the Palestinians via territory swaps with farmland near Gaza. He offered the Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem, and offered a free corridor between Gaza and the WB.

The Palestinians refused.

Israel cannot leave the WB, without the Palestinians accepting peace. In the 90's as part of the Oslo accords the Israelis withdrew from the Palestinian cities and Area C as an initial stage for a solution. The Palestinians used the IDF absence to build up a huge terrorist infrastructure and then used this territory to launch a huge mass suicide bombing campaign against Israel. In 2002-2003, Israel had no other option than to re-enter area C and said Palestinian cities.

In 2005 Israel left Gaza, the international community lobbied the unilateral move prommissing mass investment and that Gaza will be a new Singapure.

The thing is, I'm not so sure you have to train that by risking equipment. 

You can simulate pressure and stress with training. And you can simulate tactics by playing war games. 

That all costs money, but that is a way to push the envelope a lot further than risking lives in the real life. 

Granted, it won't be like real life. There is still a different element when the shooting starts and real lives are at risk. That said, people are not always 100% predictable. They might do extremely well in the first battle and then have severe PTSD for the second one and severely under perform. 

I think the trick is to see how well leaders think on their feet. Not necessarily risky behavior. Because thinking in their feet shows creativity and initiative. 

And honestly, in a large navy to you'd probably want a combination of timid and risky leaders. That means everybody is unpredictable in aggressiveness. Also, you definitely want to train in unpredictable doctrine.

&gt; * While any use of a nuclear weapon is unthinkable to most of the world, under current Russian military doctrine — usually described in shorthand as “escalate to deescalate” — Putin could choose a nuclear “demonstration” as a warning to halt further American military aid to the Ukrainians. In other words, for the Russian leader, detonation of a tactical nuclear weapon by Russia is entirely thinkable. And so the West needs to do some thinking, too.

&gt; * Reportedly, the smallest tactical weapon in the Russian nuclear arsenal has a yield of about one-third the size of Hiroshima or Nagasaki bombs, or equivalent to about 5,000 tons of TNT.

&gt; * There are a few ways that such a tactical nuclear weapon could be used to fire the kind of “warning shot” envisioned in Russian military doctrine. These options come with increasing degrees of risk for the U.S., Ukraine and its allies, and for Russia.

&gt; * But the warning shot idea would surface again and be taken more seriously. During the 1961 Berlin crisis, former President John Kennedy was presented with the option of firing a nuclear-tipped missile at Novaya Zemlya to show American resolve. Israel has also considered a nuclear demonstration; prior to the Six-Day War, in May 1967, Shimon Peres proposed detonating a nuclear device over the Sinai desert to head off the conflict. Six years later, the Israelis again briefly entertained the notion of a high-altitude nuclear warning shot to force an end to 1973’s Yom Kippur War. In 1981, with the Cold War again heating up, Secretary of State Alexander Haig — a former NATO supreme allied commander — let slip that “there are contingency plans in the NATO doctrine to fire a nuclear weapon for demonstrative purposes …”",b8669a8fef877008688f90257cffa8bacf948a56,True,False,,,,,0,1652763922,,0,{},i8wuk8w,True,t3_urexjs,False,True,t3_urexjs,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/urexjs/three_scenarios_for_how_putin_could_actually_use/i8wuk8w/,1652763938,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652735122.0,

[],False,,Voteins,,,[],,,,text,t2_12yjl9,False,True,"Really interesting thread [here](https://twitter.com/KofmanMichael/status/1526219837013385216) by Kofman where he posits that virtually all the public estimates of Russian casualties are overstated, even ones previously considered more reliable like those from the UK MoD/US intel/NATO.

Kofman estimates Russia may have only lost as little as 10,000 men, with somewhat over 45,000 total casualties. Compare that to the 15,000 figure put out by the UK MoD, which is one of the lower ones, which he estimates would lead to over 75,000 casualties.

This doesn't, however, mean that the Russians are in a substantially better position than assumed because Kofman also believes that the total number of Russian troops has also been exaggerated. He estimates there were only 80-90k soldiers in maneuver units at the start of the invasion, LPR/DPR militia and Rosgvardia might add another 20-25k, and additional troops added during the second phase might amount to 10-12k. This means total frontline soldiers are somewhere between 110k and 127k.

His estimate of 10k deaths and 45k+ total casualties would amount to 35-40%+ of maneuver troops. His slightly higher estimate of 12k deaths and 54k+ total casualties would place it at 42-49%+. Note that a military unit is usually considered incapable of further action when it reaches 50% casualties.

Normally I would discount someone putting out such a radically alternate take from the conventional wisdom, but Kofman has been really on the ball in the past so this might have some plausibility to it. Kofman says he's going to be releasing an article with [Rob Lee](https://twitter.com/RALee85) soon with sources on how he arrived at this much lower Russian force structure.",a7871d5f505be0ede92e5fe40a0315fbdba9ffe3,True,False,,,,,0,1652746015,,0,{},i8vxpw4,False,t3_uqua8k,False,True,t3_uqua8k,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uqua8k/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_16_2022/i8vxpw4/,1652746028,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652717215.0,
