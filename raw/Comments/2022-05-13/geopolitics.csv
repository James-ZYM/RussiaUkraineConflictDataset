Agreed, Russia has been fermenting hatred for a long time.  First with the USSR, and their more recent invasions and aggression against their neighbors after the USSR fell.

&gt;What aggression has Finland suffered.

Russia is literally threatening Finland right now, this very second.  Russia's actions show that it can and will threaten any neighbor.  Finland is choosing to get protection now, rather than be caught like Ukraine without protection.

&gt;It is very possible that the West would escalate a nuclear war. They are that psychotic.

You need to turn off the Russia State TV every now and then and smell the roses.  If the West was willing to risk nuclear escalation, there would be a bunch of NATO airplanes over Ukraine right now drive off Putin's invading army.  If anyone starts chucking nukes first, it will definitely be Russia.  As Ukraine is currently demonstrating, the Russian army is little threat to NATO and the only thing Russia has left to make its mafia like threats are nuclear weapons.",40238e777f967f706879fc44a98e3ecd1c1f36cd,True,False,,,,,0,1652485361,,0,{},i8il3al,False,t3_uourn2,False,True,t1_i8ik720,/r/geopolitics/comments/uourn2/as_finland_is_all_set_to_apply_for_nato/i8il3al/,1652485380,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1652456561.0

15 years ago everyone still had hope that Russia was a democratizing nation that could have peaceful relationships with it's neighbors.  That was obviously a delusional belief.  The ""whatever reason"" for the sudden hostility to Russia is the realization that it is definitely an autocratic dictatorship with hostile expansionist desires and an absolute willingness to poison, assassinate, and invade neighboring nations.

I mean, it’s doubtful their economy will “wither away” considering 90% of the world is still trading with them, in particular China.

It is a laughable notion to consider that 90% of the world is still trading with them. It will be a small comfort for every single Russian company whose earnings come from abroad your message that ""Hey, cheer up, Thailand, Mozambique and Mexico are still trading with us!"", as if they could make up in any fashion the size and scale of trading with the EU. The majority of those 90% of the world that you are talking about has little substantial trading relations with Russia. The ones that do, like China and India, are simply looking at Russia with predatory eyes as they force Russia to sell their oil ever more cheaply. And Russia, in the desperate situation that it is in, of course will sell the oil as cheaply as long as it keeps the money flowing. 

Considering that a massive part of the Russian State budget is made up of hydrocarbon sales, you can probably realize the colossal hit that it is taking. Outside of the hydrocarbonate trade, the export economy of the Russian economy is comparatively quite minor.

I invite you to take a look at [the state of the Russian export economy in January 2022 or on 2020](https://oec.world/en/profile/country/rus). Expecting China to even remotely make up for the loss of the European, North American and Japanese markets is nothing short of delusional.

I want you to look at the preponderance of hydrocarbonate sales in the Russian economy and the preponderance of the economies currently sanctioning the Russian economy. That's roughly half of the export value of January 2022 wiped out.

In regards to the ruble, it is propped by draconian anti-spending and anti-investment measures made exactly to prevent it from collapsing. It's not because the economy didn't immediately fall off a cliff that the one can simply claim that it is ""chugging along"". Just read the sober statements by the Russian Central bank itself. Staple product prices have shot up, in a country with low incomes and limited food security. Supply chains for many of its industry chains have gone up in flames, and in the high-tech sectors especially, it's nigh impossible to source different suppliers, not even account for compromising price margins of raw material quality.

[],False,,Joltie,,,[],,,,text,t2_7kzhv,False,False,"&gt; To be honest, it does seem that Russia has won in the long term with this war at least within the context of Ukraine.

I always find it humorous how some people really try to eke out a victory out of the unmitigated disaster that the campaign is being. There is no proof that turning Ukraine into a landlocked country permanently at war was Russia's objective. To the contrary, all evidence points to the goal being a painless and lightning quick invasion that would oust the current government and put a friendly one that would acquiesce to the annexation of Crimea and eventually whatever other lands they'd want to take and stay permanently in Russian orbit.

The goal was to practically present the Western powers with a fait accomplis and so that any threats of sanctions would quickly desintegrate before the reality of the changes on the ground.

Being extremely sanctioned and boycotted by a significant part of the world, and being stuck in a brutal war of attrition against a determined and unbroken enemy, going through their equipment and monetary reserves at rapid pace was far, far from the victory that they anticipated.

Russia has lost so thoroughly that it is obvious it no longer will win quickly, and every inch they take further only plunges them deeper into the quagmire, and makes it harder for them to withdraw from the conflict without looking weak and losing face.

Russia's ambition supposedly was to push NATO expansion back, reestablish or enlarge their own sphere of influence, and keep expanding a common market with enough captive consumers to increase wealth of Russian companies, in a position akin to Germany in the EU. They have failed in every prospect imaginable.

To think that Russia wants for permanent conflict and the permanent massive sapping of their own reserves of youth in a conflict by their doorstep, and the permanent economic depression that such a situation brings, and arguing that is the victory they were seeking is simply a bad reading of the situation, in my opinion.

Russia is in stuck in an utterly awful position, in a conflict they can't win, as their economic base withers away, and they are going on due to sheer desperation of the regime to somehow extricate themselves from the situation in a way that won't end with them ousted, arrested or assassinated.",11c18e04b459d250307dc1d635e28ff712c4962d,True,False,,,,,0,1652463596,,0,{},i8h7kxh,False,t3_uotw8w,False,True,t1_i8gsuap,/r/geopolitics/comments/uotw8w/no_marshall_plan_for_ukraine_geography_and/i8h7kxh/,1652463611,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1652434796.0

Upon Finland's and Sweden's official application to join NATO, Turkish President Erdogan has indicated he may veto their applications.

This objection is also based around the fact that Sweden in particular has friendly relations to the North Syrian Kurdish-led polity, the Autonomous Administration in North and East Syria, led by the PYD party which Turkey considers to be the Syrian wing of the PKK. This is something not believed to be true outside Turkey and its closest allies such as Azerbaijan.

Ann Linde, Sweden's Foreign Minister, stated she believed Erdogan was trying to bargain for both foreign and domestic gains, and does not hold a deep opposition to Sweden and Finland joining NATO. It is possible that they simply want concessions from the west (in particular, the US), and if these are satisfied they will drop their veto. This could take a number of forms, including: speeding up the delivery of F16s, the US removing CAATSA sanctions from Turkey, the US/west lessening relations with the AANES, certain states clamping down on diaspora Kurdish civil society, and supporting Turkish maritime boundary claims vs Greece and Cyprus.

Perhaps the most enduring legacy of the Marshall Plan, the massive U.S. program to rebuild Western Europe’s economy after World War II, is the endless desire to repeat it. Daunting geopolitical challenges invariably spawn appeals for new Marshall Plans to foster stability and prosperity. The global financial crisis seeded in 2008 brought forth calls for a Marshall Plan in southern Europe. The Arab Spring did the same in the Middle East. Ditto the civil war in Syria.  
Today, Ukraine, victim of horrific mass brutality and destruction, is only the latest in a procession of stricken countries spurring calls for the legend’s reapplication. “There will be a new Marshall Plan for Ukraine,” declared Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in March. European Council President Charles Michel concurred, announcing that a May donor conference was “the starting point for \[a\] kind of European Marshall Plan for Ukraine.”  
On its surface, Ukraine would appear to be fertile ground for a Marshall Plan. It is, much like most of the 16 Marshall Plan recipients of 1948–1952, a market-oriented European country with democratic foundations, anxious to integrate more closely with its neighbors to the west. It has great untapped potential in energy production, chemicals, agriculture, and industrial manufacturing.

Yet Ukraine suffers from an immutable characteristic that even the most noble and generous of foreign saviors cannot change: geography. Ukraine borders a powerful country to the east, Russia, whose government does not wish it to look westward for salvation or to succeed as a prosperous, independent country. And Russia is fully capable of undermining, with mere threats, any steps Ukraine may take in this direction.  
To be sure, Ukraine’s rich friends in the United States and western Europe can do much to aid the country’s suffering people and to rebuild its damaged infrastructure. Yet without Russian cooperation or at least committed noninterference—a noninterference that is inconceivable currently or in the foreseeable future—the robust and enduring revival experienced by the Marshall countries is simply beyond Ukraine’s reach.""",b41bbbe107f4cef0b2d7d1161ffca6e4c59fcb97,True,False,,,,,0,1652454711,,0,{},i8gl5lx,True,t3_uotw8w,False,True,t3_uotw8w,/r/geopolitics/comments/uotw8w/no_marshall_plan_for_ukraine_geography_and/i8gl5lx/,1652454723,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1652425911.0

Hence my point. Which isn't that Article 5 isn't important, only that it isn't quite as important as we think it is. The wording is just one part of that point. The bulk of it stems from the notion that countries are much more willing to lose ""prestige"" and ""trust"" than many are willing to accept.

The Russian's threw away their reputation (in Europe anyway) over Ukraine and the Chinese are quite content to continue their actions against the Uyghurs. 

If Article 5 is invoked and a handful of nations refuse to throw the full weight of their military behind the nation being attacked, it will just get explained away like everything else.

I don't disagree with you on the topic of the EU defence clause. Media and Politicians all place a great deal of focus on NATO's article 5. It holds much more weight in the hearts and minds of regular citizens. I just don't think the *legal* commitment is anything special. Perhaps if politicians could be trusted, then I certainly could imagine a world where the US would readily take a nuclear missile to New York if that meant defending Warsaw. 

But until the day it happens...I don't think its very useful to view Article 5 as if its some kind of automatic, algorithmic response. It sounds good to people and certainly makes the citizens of countries that have allied themselves with the US *feel* better about the policy of their governments. At the end of the day, I'm more inclined to think that countries will act according to their interests, irrespective of treaty obligations.

[],False,,sandanx,,,[],,,,text,t2_dnqkw,False,False,"&gt; Contrary to popular belief, the text of Article 5 doesn't say member states have to join in the war directly

There is clear implication of that from the first part of the article. If an agressor would declare war on one of the NATO countries, by means of article 5, it would be considered that he declared war on all of them. Yes, the article doesn't go into detail about what the response of the allies should be, but it is clearly expected that they would also be at war.

Now, for the second part of the article. You're taking it out of context. It's "" consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, [...], will assist [...] by taking forthwith, [...], such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, **to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area**"". This has a very specific goal of restoring security in NATO. The EU defence clause, on the other hand, says only ""If a Member State is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other Member States shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power"". That's it. While sending some economic help, for example, could be considered ""all means in their power to aid"", it could never be considered ""such action as it deems necessary to restore and maintain security of the North Atlantic area"". Yes, both of them say ""do what you can"", but one says ""do what you can to help the member country"" and the other says ""do what you can to restore security in NATO"".

And while the semantics of this can be debated, what can't be debated is this little part out of the EU defence clause ""Commitments and cooperation in this area shall be consistent with commitments under the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which, for those States which are members of it, remains
the foundation of their collective defence and the forum for its implementation."", which clearly states that the NATO defence clause is more important and takes precedence.",78f61cd811a8b64f06a155cefeb3b76b3ab318d0,True,False,,,,,0,1652437128,,0,{},i8fmwus,False,t3_unumv9,False,True,t1_i8e18mx,/r/geopolitics/comments/unumv9/uk_makes_mutual_security_pact_with_finland_and/i8fmwus/,1652437143,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1652408328.0

Lets flip the last statement regarding Russia and China around. 

The US is a threat to international stability because of its militant brand of liberal democracy that puts it in opposition with most authoritarian nations. 

You are assuming that international stability =/= democracy. Thats a big assumption to make considering you yourself have pointed out that the US has commited numerous crimes against humanity and that these kind of crimes are by no means limited to authoritarian nations. 

I personally think that the current system cannot be expected to police actions like Russia's invasion of Ukraine simply because the scope for hypocrisy is far too high and the UN has made a habit of ignoring war crimes and breaches of the rules by members of the security council for pretty much its entire existence. Its literally too late to start policing things now.
