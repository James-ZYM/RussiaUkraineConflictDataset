I just don't see it.

A decapitation strike absoluely would set off a full scale strategic nuclear response by Russia, probably whilst it was still in the air. Thats going to entail a full scale 2nd strike by the US subs.

Not really, China is the worlds largest trading nation. But it only makes up around 14.5% or the worlds exports. Considering China makes up around 17% of the worlds population it actually underperforms in exports compared to the stereotype.

Even then, China’s demographic bomb will end these hopes of economic domination:

The US had [4 million births last year](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/birth-rate#:%7E:text=1%20The%20current%20birth%20rate%20for%20U.S.%20in,per%201000%20people%2C%20a%200.95%25%20decline%20from%202017.) compared to [10.6 million births in China](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/birth-rate-mainland-china-2021-drops-record-low-2022-01-17/). Then you add that the US takes in around [1 million immigrants per year](https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/yearbook/2016/table7) and that [China has net emigration](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/CHN/china/net-migration) of around 350,000 people per year we can really compare. 

So the US population grows by roughly 5 million per year, and China at around 10 million. You don’t think that’s at all worrying that China’s population is only growing 2x that of the US when it has 4.5x the population? Nominally China is growing more, but when you look at overall population size the US blows China out of the water in terms of relative growth in population.",91b775a8c93472e61c4d4146a4432678d7cb02e2,True,False,,,,,0,1652485803,,0,{},i8ilzh3,False,t3_uigw3g,False,True,t1_i8iiyaq,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uigw3g/deterring_china_a_victory_denial_strategy_the/i8ilzh3/,1652485820,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652457003.0,

So sending 200,000 soldiers to attack a nation of 40+million is not a lot. Really, they're very low on troops. They have also avoided declaring war, likely because of concerns it would lead to domestic resistance to the war, so they can't use their full army.

Ukraine has likely won the Battle of Kharkiv. Russian forces continued to withdraw from the northern settlements around Kharkiv City. Ukrainian forces will likely attempt to disrupt Russian ground lines of communication to Izyum.  
Ukrainian forces have likely disrupted the Russian attempt to cross the Siverskyi Donets River in force, undermining Russian efforts to mass troops in northern Donbas and complete the encirclement of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk.  
Russian forces have likely secured the highway near the western entrance to the Azovstal Steel Plant but fighting for the facility continues.

[],False,,Kvetch__22,,,[],,,,text,t2_wa50e,False,False,"Not sure what my takeaway is supposed to be from that?

My argument is that the idea that certain nation states have definite natural rights to assert authority over other nation states is a thoughtless and elitist proposition. The article referenced here is explicitly talking about Eastern Europe, which largely involves Russia demanding influence over former Soviet states. 

But this is also true all over the world, and I would argue against any claims that the US demanding influence in the Pacific and the Americas is somehow special or different. Same with China demanding influence over Asia or the UK/France engaging in neo-colonialism in their former empires.

If you wanted a differentiating principle, I might argue that there is a difference between the US expressing displeasure at a Chinese base in the Solomons versus Russia invading Ukraine to prevent their elected goverment from pursuing NATO membership. The notion that individuals and democratic governance have no role to play in geopolitics is bad in an ivory tower kind of way. But take that proposition to where Russia has taken it -that populations who make the wrong choice for the geopolitical order deserve to be punished with mass death- is criminal.

But overall, I also think there is a distinction to draw between how states approach their foreign policy and how academics approach international relations. It doesn't surprise me that the US, for example, is protesting expanding Chinese presence in the Pacific, or that China would balk at US arms sales to Taiwan. Russia's demands for a security sphere, however ridiculous, are well founded in Russian theories about state security. 

But national governments definitionally act in their own self-interest. When Russia makes demands, they are not justified beyond the idea that accomplishing those goals would be good for Russia. It is a wholenother thing for academics to step-in and argue that, from an objective academic perspective, Russia's security concerns should morally be prioritized over the self-determination of the Ukranian people is another thing entirely. To argue that democracy is bad for Russian self-interst is redundant; we all know that democracy in Eastern Europe has been a disaster for Russian foreign policy. But the argument that democracy in Eastern Europe has been bad for humanity, and that Russia should be allowed to put vassal populations to the sword, is the kind of pernicious academic nonsense we could do without.

To go back to the Solomons, I don't think the US contemplating military action reflects much other than the fact that states will behave as states. If anything, it's an indictment of the intellectuals I'm talking about. Very rarely do the people obsessed with the inviolability of the Russian security sphere spend the same energy contemplating and American of European security sphere. They are guilty of seeing the world through Russian or Chinese state security needs. 

There are also people who, equally deserving of condemnation, never see anything other than American security needs. Ultimately, the UN Charter provides for the right of self-determination of all people. The democratic power of mass movements is a significant force in the world, much more than pure power realists want to admit. If I have any argument here it's that ignoring this only leads to unnecessary conflict and death.",317bcafa0d8a41914e10f97d2810966052335b3b,True,False,,,,,0,1652484746,,0,{},i8ijtyn,False,t3_uoq4bh,False,True,t1_i8if30v,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uoq4bh/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_13_2022/i8ijtyn/,1652484760,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652455946.0,

So part of the military budget - personnel costs - is saved by poor countries, but the much more important part - acquisition and equipment costs, is the same price for everyone. 

In the air and at sea, poor countries see little to no savings over rich ones for deployment of the same capabilities. On land, there is much less savings for units that require a lot of equipment, from logistics, to tanks, to artillery. Basically the only major cost savings you get is light infantry.

Former National Security Advisor John Bolton said on Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin was waiting for former President Donald Trump to withdraw the United States from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization if he had won a second term.  
Bolton made the remarks during a virtual event with the Washington Post on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where Bolton mostly offered critiques of current President Joe Biden's foreign policy in the region. At the end of the event, he was asked by the Post's Michael Duffy about how close Trump came to withdrawing the country from NATO, a translantic security alliance that includes the United States, Canada, and most of Europe.   
""I thought he put his foot over it, but at least he didn't withdraw then,"" said Bolton, who wrote in his memoir about Trump's consideration of withdrawing from NATO in 2018. ""In a second Trump term, I think he may well have withdrawn from NATO. And I think Putin was waiting for that.""",3e830eb75430519b435c00922222b5a0868e0e48,True,False,,,,,0,1652483131,,0,{},i8igi6u,False,t3_uoq4bh,False,True,t1_i8ibjux,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uoq4bh/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_13_2022/i8igi6u/,1652483147,1,False,False,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652454331.0,

&gt; Also if you are protesting anti-protest laws (which is where things escalated).... you don't try and violently overthrow the government

I disagree, fundamentally. If a government has passed laws forbidding protests, it means they are no longer interested in being a democracy. That’s exactly the time to take to the streets.

&gt; It's hard to know exactly what's in putin's head,

We do know what was in Medvedev’s head, and it was “kill the protestors or we cut you off economically” which is the message he gave to Yankovich. 

&gt; The inherent problem is that nobody involved was particularly democratic in my view

Perhaps, but these events did pave the way for a Ukraine that is democratic. Zelensky had rock bottom approval, but international observers noted the election was fair. 

&gt; There were literal US senators (such as mccain) making speeches to the maidan protestors encouraging them to oust their government. The US state department was handing out fucking cookies in independence square and having phone conversations about who they wanted to be in charge when the revolution succeeded.

I think the phone conversation is exaggerated. My take, having read the transcript was it was more “who are the possible people who will take over, and which one is likely to be friendlist to the US?” which is a conversation diplomatics have all the time in these situations. I don’t get any indication they were at all able to “pick” a leader like post WW2 Japan. 

As for speeches, fine, whatever. Given that the Russians absolutely use *undeclared* state actors and bot farms to influence nutjobs in the US, I would be absolutely *ecstatic* if instead Russian politicians gave speeches about overthrowing the government. That way there is 0 confusion over where the message is coming from. 

&gt; The idea that it was just yanukovych 'giving someone the nod' and then the death squads going out to murder everyone is fanciful

I actually looked this up. Prior to the 2015 reforms, the Berkut were actually directly answerable to the President. So yes, he could “give the nod” and send them out.

&gt; In May 2007, the ongoing political crisis in Ukraine lead to a jurisdiction dispute over the country's Internal Troops. Following minor political clashes involving the militsiya and presidential security forces, President Viktor Yuschenko issued a decree re-subordinating Internal Troops from the Ministry of Internal Affairs directly to the President.

&gt; We can overlook things like extrajudicial murders because they're the 'good guys' or because it suits our geopolitical end goals of curtailing russia

I want to use this as a general discussion point to encompass a bunch of what you wrote, which is about violence, corruption, and extremism on the part of the protestors, which is also a good segue into discussing war crimes comitted by Ukrainian soldiers in this conflict.

It is absolutely true that these things did and do occur, though I can’t comment on whether or not I believe some of your statements were accurate. Similarly, anyone who commits an extrajudicial murder or the killing of a prisoner of war should ideally be prosecuted.

However, we can’t get sucked into “whataboutism” or attempting moral equivalency. Particularly in the case where the one side is doing this things at a significantly greater rate and on a considerably larger scale than the other. I constantly see people trying to use complaints about Ukraine’s corruption or individual instances of POW mistreatment as evidence that they are “just as bad” as the russians. It’s a distraction that allows key elements (e.g. one person is doing the invading, the other is being invaded) to disappear from the discussion.

At any rate, it was interesting to see your thoughts on this, so thank you for taking a good faith effort to expand on what you were thinking and outline how you see events.

But as other commenters have noted, I think there will be a need to see whether this is a bluff or not. Once this plan is put in place, there seems to be inevitable logic to how it must unfold.

I do not see how Ukraine could not call this bluff. They would have to.

Even if the US threaten to pull support, they'd still have to call it..... because if they do not, then next time Putin will come for Mykolaiv/Odessa, or Kharkiv, or any other territory east of the Dnieper knowing full well if he can grab some land he can present a *fait accompli* and keep it with the same threat. Ukraine can't stop at the threat, it has to find out if they will follow through and force that decision.

I also suspect Russia must know this, and so if this is their chosen strategy *it cannot be a bluff*. They're going to have to set-off a nuke, possibly several, or at least realise thats a high probability scenario if they try this. With the hope being that this brings peace talks, and the rest of the world effectively blinks in the game of chicken and normalises relations anyway.

I do not think this would neccessarily lead to a nuclear exchange.... in an attempt to limit the damage of this course to russia, it seems likely that the nuke (or several) will be tac nukes deployed on the battlefield some way from highly populated areas. Civilian casualties wouldn't be very high, although military casualties might. I can't see a nuclear response in that scenario.

But, Jesus Christ, that a godawful precedent to set (A nuclear power can win conventional wars and take territory by using nukes to enforce the annexation) and I can't imagine the rest of the world.... including China.... could let that stand, even if the response isn't immediately nuclear. 

Maybe the Russians don't try this.... maybe at the step that Putin gives the order to fire the nukes the Siloviki say ""enough"" and he has ""an unexpected heart attack"".... maybe Ukraine backs down and doesn't call the bluff. 

But each of those steps seems, on its own, the less likely outcome... and the terrifying progression the more likely one.

[],False,,Acies,,,[],,,,text,t2_3mz6e,False,False,"I agree this is alarming because threatening to use nukes to protect seized Ukrainian territory would be a dramatic escalation, but I'm skeptical about whether this sort of use of word games would be effective.

There's a lot of alternative ways this could be used against Russia. For example, the US could sign a defense agreement with Ms. Tsikhanouskaya, the lawful president of Belarus, and order Russia to vacate the country because they are now trespassers, with a nuclear war as a consequence if they don't comply. We could do something similar with the Georgian government, or the Moldavan government, for their occupied territories. We could give Ukraine nuclear security assurances and see who blinks first.

The problem with doing all this stuff is that it's not clear we are going to, and if we say we will and then we don't we take a huge hit in terms of credibility. Russia has the same problem. and Russia is sensitive to the risks of bluffing with nuclear weapons. That's why they threatened ""consequences beyond anything you have ever experienced"" or some other vague allusion back at the start of the invasion, instead of giving explicit terms for what would trigger a nuclear response. And they have shown they are concerned about escalation because despite considerable bluster, they have not responded in any material way to any of the escalations from the US, Ukraine, or anyone else, and there have been many, from the bombing runs into Russian territory, to the steadily increasing military aid and the leak that the US contributed to the killing of Russian generals and the sinking of the Moscova.

The way I see the nuclear game at the moment, is that Russia has always had the ability to win this war any time it wanted to. All it has to do is nuke every population center in Ukraine and its armies would be able to handle the rest conventionally. The Ukrainian calculus is that they have to stay away from taking any legitimately Russian territory and otherwise fight the war as if nuclear weapons don't exist, because if they respond to any nuclear threats, it allows Russia to whittle their country away one nuclear-backed land grab at a time, and trust that the ambiguity of a response from the nuclear powers of the world will be sufficient to deter Russia.

I don't see how playing games with borders changes this.

The other interesting thing of note is that this prediction seems to be a bit counter to what we seem to have coming out of the Kremlin. Specifically, Peskov made it pretty clear that they are looking to keep Kherson at arm's length for now.

Lloyd Austin just publicly released his goal (and hence new US policy), which is to reestablish comms with Russia to get an immediate ceasefire. Which means if the new overt US policy is fulfilled, the Russian military isn't going to get destroyed inside Ukraine. And it means Ukraine doesn't get to reclaim their lost territory. 

Which is harder/riskiest? Ukraine accepting those terms? Or getting cut off their patron to continue the war?

Yanukovych was a democratically elected leader. Democracy already existed. He wasn't a dictator.

Maidan as far as i can tell did absolutely nothing to make ukraine more democratic. It was just the standard corrupt oligarchs using the stick of corruption to beat their rivals with so they could take up their role as the new corrupt oligarch.

&gt; He should have been, but he wasn't because it was impossible with the system he controlled. He controlled the judges and evidently the law enforcement. So who's going to hold him accountable? Do you see the dilemma now?

Surely if he controlled the law enforcement they wouldn't have all refused to enforce the law? He never would have had to flee kiev. He would have remained president.

Again i'm not criticising the reasons behind the protests. I'm saying that the protests had won. Yanukovych had signed his defeat. 

&gt; replace ""not just"" with ""almost entirely"".

The actions of the 'interim government' were not one of a group 'taking down corrupt elites'. They were the actions of one seizing power for themselves.

&gt; The plight of the people whose allegiance was always to Russia is ENTIRELY irrelevant. Those folks should have packed up and left if they wanted to live in Russia.

Lmao so much of this is reminiscent of the brexit debate. If you think people that disagree with you should 'fuck off and leave the country' you don't care about democracy. You only care about enforcing your own ideology. I can't count the number of times i've been told to do the same for wanting to remain part of the EU. Or the number of times brexit extremists have called remainers 'traitors'... for following the law and upholding democratic principles no less. Are you seeing the similarities yet?

The only irony is that the ones making the ridiculous nationalistic arguments are the ones that want closer ties to the EU. 

&gt; Azov for instance is as Nationalistic as it gets, and almost entirely composed of Russian speakers; and so were other volunteer battalions. Those that are fighting Russia now are probably like 50% Russian speakers. Kharkiv, Odessa, Mariupol all Russian speaking cities. This isn't a language issue. It's a Russian propaganda issue; and you're spreading it.

Clearly there are nuances to it that i don't understand, but i can only go on the facts that i can read.

Why is it that a government put there to 'promote democracy and restore corrupt elites' in the midst of a country in dire crisis... wasted their *first day* removing russian as a state language? At absolute best it was reckless, petty, populist, nationalist pandering. At worst it was them exploiting the opportunity to try and change the state to fulfil some pretty radical nationalistic plans.

The post-war security arrangement in Europe was not some platonic ideal of geopolitical balancing. It was created based on an arbitrary line on the map stemming from military campaigns waged during the war. It collapsed because the economic and political forces that had sustained it for years were no longer able to support it. 

Most importantly, the end of the Warsaw Pact and the incorporation of Eastern Europe into a broader EU architecture was not the decision of a few powerful people with an axe to grind against the USSR. Ultimately it was the democratic and wholly organic choices of Eastern European people that led them to democratic pro-western governments. And now these realists come along to explain how, actually, this was a bad thing.

That is really, on an ideological level, what this war is about. These pro-Moscow realists see Ukraine as a piece on a game board to be bought and sold, and that Russia as a geopolitical entity somehow has a natural right to control its destiny and dictate its terms. There is no room in this conversation for the 40 million Ukrainians, most of whom have elected a government that looks to Europe for its future and not Moscow. Hyper-realism is the enslavement of individual freedom to harmonious academic schematics of geopolitics that exist to be pretty, rather than to describe the world. Watch scholars throw a fit when Ukraine decides to go West when the script dictates they should always be East.

And you're right, these folks are super inconsistent about it. I would also point out that if these bizarre notions of ""natural spheres"" and ""security balances"" mean anything, Russia and China should let the US invade Cuba and Venezuela without complaining because clearly those countries should be pro-American even if the people living there don't want to be.

The GOP president after Bush talked openly about quitting NATOm openly criticized it, and pal'd around with Putin himself, often complimenting and defending him personally, Russia, and his foreign policy and intelligence apparatus.

[],False,,chowieuk,,,[],,,,text,t2_b230l,False,False,"&gt; My reading of the situation was that a peaceful revolution was impossible as Yankovich was more or less outlawing his opposition.

He had tymoshenko arrested a couple of years earlier and obviously it was politically motivated, but i couldn't find anything saying she hadn't actually broken the law. Of course the nature of ukraine is that anyone in power has probably broken the law. Zelensky pulled the same stunt against TWO of his rivals last year. Of course when the former did it to  tymoshenko - a 'darling of the european media' - there was outrage. This time round zelensky was praised. That he had his opponents arrested just after losing his lead in the polls is apparently not worthy of discussion.

(As you can tell i take strong issue with the way things are reported)

&gt; Combine that with the violence against the protestors, which was shockingly bad, and I don't see how you could expect people to do things ""the right way"" unless you either don't know or don't believe his level of corruption and violence.

It's clearly a complex thing and obviously i can only go on the factual tidbits that i can glean, but a few thoughts:

1. ukriane isn't a dictatorship. Yanukovych was freely and fairly elected in a democracy. There are numerous levels of responsibility. The idea that it was just yanukovych 'giving someone the nod' and then the death squads going out to murder everyone is fanciful (unless i've completely missed something).

2. Violent protestors forcing their way through police lines to try and get to a sitting parliament is basically always going to be responded to with violence of some form. In no country in the world is that going to be allowed.

3. I very much doubt the ukrainian security services/ riot police have any sort of proper de-escalation training or policies. More likely you have a large number of ill-trained people doing a job they don't know how to do. Invariably that's not going to end well in such a situation. Look how well it went in the US where presumably the police are better trained. All protests have agitators trying to inflame shit, and it's on the police not to inflame tensions and to respond appropriately.

4. Even if we ignore the background and just say that yes the violence was terribly bad, there were basically no police at that point. They'd all either been ordered to withdraw or they'd run off lest they be blamed for the violent response. A wholly bizarre turn of events really. just abandoning the capital city to armed protestors.

5. Yanukovych had already lost. His options were resign or be forced out by parliament.

In essence the whole thing was a shitshow. Clearly the leadership fucked up in a big way and clearly it's a scenario where the leadership would resign if they had any dignity. But what laws were actually broken? It seems that it doesn't even matter. All we're left with are simplistic politicised narratives. I believe they tried to charge him with treason, which seems to be pretty standard given it's vague as hell. The ridiculously corrupt court system doesn't help in that regard.

Also if you *are* protesting anti-protest laws (which is where things escalated).... you don't try and violently overthrow the government. That's literally making their point for them that you're incapable of utilising your right to protest responsibly. 

My broad take is that a lot of it was fueled by more subversive elements seeking to push their own agenda (as tends to happen in most populist movements) - one bent on extreme nationalism and a vitriolic hatred of russia (the first kinda necessitates the other). It's no surprise that the far right svoboda [seemingly dominated the protests](https://voxukraine.org/en/denial-of-the-obvious-far-right-in-maidan-protests-and-their-danger-today/) (analysis by a ukrainian academic). It's no surprise that their first move after seizing power was to remove russian as a state language... rather than anything at all relevant to the actual mass protests. It's no surprise that they banned a million people from government work due to tenuous links to yanukovych. It's no surprise that all of yanukovych's associates that didn't flee the country were conveniently murdered. It's no surprise that Lviv oblast was apparently allowed to declare its independence from yanukovych but the reverse wasn't true of eastern regions. It's no surprise that over 40 people advocating *federalism* (note: not even secession) were burned alive in odessa and the authorities have done nothing about it, whilst they instead have prosecuted federalists or secessionists for much more trivial crimes. None of their actions indicate any desire for a 'corruption free, unified, democratic ukraine', but in fact exactly the opposite. Even now zelensky has to sit on tv and not denounce a prominent neonazi group that he clearly isn't comfortable with. All in all it's no surprise that the russians call it an extreme nationalist coup. Frankly that's exactly how it looks

Of course everything fell into place nicely. Yanukovych was 'pro russia' (but importantly yet always conveniently ignored also pro ukrainian/ pro himself) so he could be dismissed as 'evil putin's puppet'. Obviously this was helped by the fact he fled to russia (he clearly would have been an idiot not to if he didn't want to be strung up)(similar thing happened to snowden, who is now also dismissed as a kremlin puppet). The protestors declared themselves pro western and pro democracy, so obviously the entire western media and political establishment lapped it up and didn't care about the huge list of extremely problematic things happening. 'democracy wins over russian puppet' became the narrative. We can overlook things like extrajudicial murders because they're the 'good guys' or because it suits our geopolitical end goals of curtailing russia.

And of course a country of the verge of civil war... fell into a civil war of sorts. Russia did their thing and secured their strategic territory in crimea, aided their 'brethren' in the east, and the rest is history. It only confirmed the narrative even more in a sort of feedback loop. Hell in 2022 we just say the entire thing from the start was planned by russia and it was a 'russian invasion'. It has led to a completely warped black and white perspective on the entire affair.

Of course eventually people realised that they'd been used and the new government was just as corrupt and self serving as the last one, but the damage had long been done. The political makeup and direction of the country permanently reset, russia a new full time enemy (due to their own actions, but also very much what those in power wanted).

&gt; We also can't pretend like russia wasn't present at every step during this process, attempting to control, direct, or influence events, culminating in the invasion of crimea.

It's a game as old as time. There were literal US senators (such as mccain) making speeches to the maidan protestors encouraging them to oust their government. The US state department was handing out fucking cookies in independence square and having phone conversations about who they wanted to be in charge when the revolution succeeded. Can you honestly imagine If Sergey Lavrov gave a fucking speech outside the capital in Washington telling protestors to overthrow the US government? Like... can you imagine it? Pure madness. If some online bots was electoral interference, that would be electoral molestation.

And yes Russia certainly played their part behind the scenes, but from what i can see that started in earnest after things escalated badly. The infamous guy (Girkin) who was apparently 'in charge' in crimea and then the donbas arrived there on the 22nd of february for instance. Another example would be the leader of crimea flew to russia to discuss secession on the 18th of february i think, but it's hard to know to what extent that sort of discussion had taken place previously. It's legitimately possible that it was just as a result of the escalating violence leading towards some form of civil war, but it's also possible the whole thing was choreographed. Russia was undoubtedly trying to influence things for their benefit.

It's hard to know exactly what's in putin's head, but when you strip back the subconscious bias/suspicion that invariably leads us to conclude everything he says is a lie, it's *plausible* that he genuinely thought he was helping ethnic russians whilst also obtaining geostrategic goals (nationalism is a hell of a drug). Of course we'll never know what the alternative was because we never got to see for example crimea try to declare independence and the ukrainian government try to shut them down (again)

&gt; So to complain that the removal of Yankovich was ""undemocratic"" ignores the broader context of forces including Yankovich himself that already badly wounded the democratic institutions of the country.

Well. The inherent problem is that nobody involved was particularly democratic in my view. Many of the protestors will have believed they were fighting for democracy, but bar the broader protest movement, democratic values appear to have played almost no role in any of the actions taken. If it did it was a very warped and undemocratic concept of democracy that delegitimised the views of other citizens and tried to sideline them.

Remember it wasn't just the leader who was overthrown. An entire democratically elected government and party were overthrown and replaced by people with completely the opposite ideology. It went well beyond punishing yanukovych, it was a seizure of political power with the aim of enforcing political goals well beyond the scope of the protests. if a democratic mandate existed at all it was for the removal of yanukovych and pretty much nothing else.

&gt; * After the end of the Cold War, the European security balance was broken, when NATO, which no longer had excuses to exist after the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, not only stayed alive, but even obtained a new role as the military support of US global hegemony. Worse, there was no other military organization in the world that could check and balance NATO. This is already a huge imbalance, Sun Keqin, a research fellow at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times.

&gt; *  It has already been proved the bloc's expansion has made Europe more dangerous instead of making it safer. Still, NATO welcomes another round of northward enlargement. Europe's security imbalance will only deteriorate. The geopolitical map of Europe is being redrawn. 

&gt; * If Finland, which shares a 1,340-kilometer-long border with Russia - longer than the Russia-Ukraine border - joins NATO, it will be a dangerous escalation of the provocation right on Russia's doorstep. The possibility of new conflict between Russia and NATO will only increase. Europe will get nothing but an even more fragile security status. 

&gt; * The fatal imbalance in the European security architecture has brought the continent to great disruption and catastrophe. This should offer a lesson to the Asia-Pacific. 

&gt; * But very recently, South Korea's national intelligence agency joined the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence as the latter's first Asian member.  Both South Korea and Japan were invited to the NATO Summit to be held next month. It may signal that US' Asian allies and NATO are forming institutional interactions. This is something to be vigilant about. 

&gt; * The US and NATO, with strong logic of power politics, bloc politics and a Cold War mind-set, may apply its tactic of turning other regions into tinderboxes in the Asia-Pacific region. 

*The Global Times (simplified Chinese: 环球时报; traditional Chinese: 環球時報; pinyin: Huánqiú Shíbào) is a daily tabloid newspaper under the auspices of the Chinese Communist Party's flagship newspaper, the People's Daily, commenting on international issues from a nationalistic perspective.[1][2][3][4] The publication has been labelled as ""China's Fox News"" by some scholars and writers for its propagandistic slant and the monetization of nationalism.*

While I do not know the specifics of the M777 enough to have recognized it missing, I do believe some of the delay on a lot of the weapons shipped to Ukraine were due to NATO countries having to ""de-classify them"" for lack of a better phrase. 

I am on mobile so I don't have the source, but there were people on twitter discussing that certain optics on the Javelin (which are pretty advanced and loved by US forces for scouting) were likely nerfed and removed, as NATO does not want Russia acquiring their weapons, let alone in large quantities to reverse engineer. 

There were entire divisions of the CIA in the cold war dedicated to finding creative ways to get their hands on Soviet weapons by doing things like retrieving destroyed helicopters in the desert, to submarines in the ocean, to boarding moving trains and trying to reverse engineer things as fast as possible before escaping into the night. 

Then there companies paid to reverse engineer these devices and there were full units in the US Military dedicated to training on them and doing training against US weapons to develop tactics. 

So it is likely a risk / reward for countries.

He said it was weird seeing that we'd sent those guns without them because it reduced the efficiency of the guns and also disallowed Ukraine to use the Excalibur shells that were supposedly sent according to reporting.

I'm now curious about it myself. Why would we hand Ukraine a gun which we'd neutered in some way? Does this have to do with the potential secretive electronics that might be in the boxes that we don't want Russia to have?

The current Russian invasion in Ukraine has, from the way it looks to me, many parallels with the 1973 Yom Kippur war (which is part of what I researched for my doctoral dissertation some years ago). 

So here's a thread on what I consider to be the most relevant aspects:

1. The strange Russian decision to go for a full-scale invasion

Why did the Russians seem to think that Ukraine would crumble in a few days, and that they could simply drive into Kyiv? To me, this looks like a classic example of groupthink.

Groupthink is a well-documented psychological phenomenon, where a group becomes increasingly isolated from the world around it, and instead seeks consensus around its own detached image of the world. No one dares to contradict what they think is the consensus.

In this manner, an increasingly unrealistic and optimistic world view can take hold and grow stronger. Opposing voices self-censor, while dissenting opinions are kept at bay by so-called ""mindguards"".

In the literature on intelligence failures, most notably Bar-Joseph's ""The Watchman Fell Asleep"", groupthink is seen as the explanation for the failure of Israeli military intelligence to predict the full-scale invasion in 1973.

In the case of the current invasion of Ukraine, I suspect that groupthink was on the invading side instead. Putin and his inner circle had probably convinced themselves that Ukraine would fall in a few days, that the Russians would be welcomed, etc.

Unlike for the Israelis in 1973, the Russians are highly reliant on detailed planning and preparation for an offensive. They can't expect much in the way of initiative to compensate for a lack of strategic leadership. This compounded their mistake, adding more weight to it.

2. ""the death of the tank"" 

When the attacking Egyptians deployed AT-3 Sagger anti-tank missiles, knocking out vast numbers of Israeli tanks in a few days. However, as we now know, tanks did in fact not become obsolete in 1973.

As with so much else, it turned out to be a matter of adjusting tactics and identifying (and to the extent possible, removing) vulnerabilities. In the end, Israeli armor did manage to go on the offensive and achieve results despite the missiles.

3. Do not expect your foe to make the same mistake twice

The Israelis had vastly underestimated their foe in 1973, because of what they saw as inferior performance during the Six-Day War in 1967. This is a lesson for the rest of us to keep in mind for the near future.

For example, the Soviet air defenses and anti-tank missiles took a heavy toll on the Israelis because the Israelis underestimated Soviet tech. Similarly, the Egyptian channel crossing was a textbook Soviet synchronized, well-rehearsed and coordinated attack.

It wasn't until the Egyptians had achieved their initial objectives that the Israelis could start to recover and counterattack. Thus, Soviet-style attacks are by no means doomed to fail every time. Initiative and mission command is not a magic wand.

Sure, the Russian performance is abysmal right now. But we should expect them to learn from this failure, like Egypt learned from 1967. We should prepare for a much more capable foe to emerge, and be careful not to underestimate neither their methods nor their technology.

There's no guarantee that the Russians will improve drastically in the next few years, but if they do, we absolutely do not want to be caught in the same situation the Israelis found themselves in back in 1973.

Finally, it is much, much better to have your intelligence community overestimate the enemy (as long as it doesn't result in concessions) than to have them underestimate them. Erring on the side of caution should not lead to exaggerated critique.

That's all for this time. If you want to read more, I strongly recommend Uri Bar-Joseph, ""The Watchman Fell Asleep"" and Irving Janis' classic book ""Groupthink"".

END

However, containment of the Russian military was and, now again, is one of the US' main commitments militarily.

The number of US troops deployed in Europe is huge and it would be better if they could be relocated to Asia. 

At the moment, for the small price of a few percent of their total defence spending the US is weakening one of the largest threats to its European allies and economic order. This is probably the best opportunity the US has, ironically, to pivot to Asia. If Russia collapses to the point where it cannot maintain its current military or nuclear forces, then the US can basically leave Europe to the Europeans.

You also have an added bonus that US and NATO commanders and personnel are getting great direct training in battlefield intelligence gathering and operations. The SIGINT guys must be having a field day, and they can directly see how effective SOF trainers really are, how good NATO tactics are and the bonus of a lot of weapons data. These are all things China has little access to. Burma is probably the main arena where they can get counter insurgency training, but they have no current conflicts with near peer adversaries.

&gt;The invasion of Ukraine has silenced most of those voices, now NATO can wave its big stick around with both sides knowing it's more likely to use it, in turn garnering more public support as the strength of the NATO alliance becomes more apparent. People like winning.

This is an interesting take. I think we are in broad agreement, and you are very much right that the anti-Putin sentiment has given NATO broad political license for a host of things that in 2014 would have been wildly unpalatable. 

But what concerns me is that what started as an assistance mission to Ukraine is now rapidly morphing into a ""defang"" Russia mission that carries with it a few *significant* risks. First and foremost is, obviously, escalation but I suspect Putin has already made the calculation that escalation won't get him what he wants (hence the lack of mobilization or war declaration thus far). 

The *other* risk that I don't see talked about at all is that it looks like the US is getting involved in (yet another) poorly defined conflict with ambiguous end-goals and no real consensus on how they can be achieved. At what point will we consider Russian military capabilities sufficiently degraded? Will that goal persist *after* a settlement is reached between Russia / Ukraine? Will the US have the opportunity to complete a pivot towards China (where the *real* showdown is) while essentially underwriting the largest war in Europe since WW2?

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"Infantry small arms usage in this sort of war have never and will never play much of a role besides during the assaults, most of which are done by AFV and not dismounts. Where the small arms do come into play more is during urban ops, close range ambushes, sniper ops, etc. Small arms perform well protecting other infantry weapons, like anti-armor or snipers, or protecting forward observers calling in arty or air strikes, and they help suppress to allow dismounts to advance in conjunction with HE weapons, specifically grenades and the like. 

The US Army decision to focus on 6.8 NGSW small arms over a near peer threat (meaning Russia)  was idiocy. Especially because they ignored the things that actually mattered. Sure, we have the Javelin but we are still very reliant on rifle squads being mass issued early 80s era M136 AT4 versus buying modern versions like NLAW. If you were a grunt squad leader facing the Russian army light on dismounts but heavy on APCs, IFV, and tanks, would you want a fancy new carbine or a weapon system better devised to kill armor? 

So why focus on small arms? 

One reason was fear. Back in the mid 2010s a HK defense salesman produced the first of the ""overmatch"" small arms powerpoint presentations that were terrifically effective for clueless general officers who don't actually know how the infantry fights. Basically it goes like this: Afghans insurgents firing at max effective range with 7.62x54R caliber small arms outranged US Army infantry predominately armed with 5.56 NATO. And guess who else uses 7.62x54R? Russia and China. Which means when we get in long range gunfights with them, they'll outrange us too! That caused a lot of angst among the senior brass, who generally know absolutely fuck all about infantry combat or small arms (after all, these are the same retards who think [Robert Scales](https://taskandpurpose.com/gear-tech/us-infantry-rifle-robert-scales/) is credible). 

Another reason was a fear of Russian and Chinese infantry wearing plate body armor. If our troops are taught to aim center mass and that's covered by plates, and if hit probability and accuracy on regular qual ranges is already so poor that specialized aiming points or repeated hits is out of the question, then that train of thought concludes with a need to be able to pierce ballistic plates covering the center torso with one shot. 

But add in the overmatch threat, and we need to be able to do that at ranges beyond 300 meters, hence the ridiculous 600 meter desire, which would mean a 130 grain bullet traveling at \~3,400 fps or faster. AKA .270 Weatherby Magnum out of a 14 inch barreled assault rifle with the stipulation that recoil isn't increased over the M4 or M249 (lol). 

And lastly, it was was the procurement pet project of the former Chief of Staff of the Army and now the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. This small arms win is his black beret, his Stryker, his legacy project besides bringing back Pink and Greens as a service uniform.",72fe9dc418fabf1b560eb5b2cb282337b8780af8,True,False,,,,,0,1652470560,,0,{},i8hof42,False,t3_uoq4bh,False,True,t1_i8hbunf,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uoq4bh/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_13_2022/i8hof42/,1652470573,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652441760.0,

Interesting to see if they'll try to be a player in their own right and dominate Southeast Asia. 

Already, in both his first and second term, Jokowi has empowered the armed forces. In the Suharto era, the armed forces were the most powerful actor in the country, but their abuses alienated the population, and their role was diminished somewhat in the early democratic period. Jokowi, however, has surrounded himself with current and former generals, and given the armed forces more control over domestic affairs. Although this approach has major downsides –  the armed forces also push Indonesian leaders for a more assertive regional approach to China, to maritime security, and to other issues.

My only real quibble is it starts with a crossing near Shypilovka that we've never seen any evidence/photos of (intact or destroyed) ... and it strangely leaves the reason the 1-2 BTGs all got grouped up in that kill zone as *Shrugs, I dunno.

———————————

&gt; * A decade after the capability was originally deleted, the United States once again plans to remove a proposed naval nuclear-armed cruise missile from its programme, though this time almost before the project started. The Sea-Launched Cruise Missile-Nuclear (SLCM-N) has been cut as part of the Biden administration’s still unreleased Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), though a classified draft may have been in circulation since late March 2022. The resulting debate, however, is not confined to deterrence-theory theologians, as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s nuclear posturing over Ukraine has made uncomfortably apparent.  

&gt; * SLCM-N aside, there is perhaps only a marginal difference between the two doctrines, and arguably the adjective that really matters regarding deterrence is ‘credible’. 

&gt; * Mirroring an adversary’s inventory or matching non-strategic warhead numbers is not the primary issue when it comes to deterrence. What really matters is having a retaliatory capacity to respond in a commensurate fashion to deter the use of a theatre or tactical nuclear weapon. 

&gt; * While SLCM-N arguably meets a capability gap, there is a debate over whether a credibility gap actually existed in the first place. It would also mean SLCM-N would not have been the only nuclear weapon in the US inventory to address the sub-strategic requirement.  

&gt; * The proposed deletion of SLCM-N appears to be motivated both by cost considerations and the suggestion that the system only offers marginal gains in capability.

&gt; * More significantly, with the impending retirement of the Ohio-class nuclear-powered guided-missile submarine (SSGN) conversions, each with 154 vertical launch system (VLS) missile cells, US submarine cruise missile firepower will be reduced. Moreover, this firepower will only partially begin to be rebuilt with the arrival of increasing numbers of Block V Virginia-class SSGNs, each with 40 VLS cells. One way or another, the US submarine fleet will be under considerable pressure, both in terms of potential requirements for conventional maritime warfighting and deterrence and stand-off attack capability.

The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) is a British research institute (or think tank) in the area of international affairs. Since 1997 its headquarters have been Arundel House in London, England.
The 2017 Global Go To Think Tank Index ranked IISS as the tenth-best think tank worldwide and the second-best Defence and National Security think tank globally,[1] while Transparify ranked it third-largest UK think tank by expenditure, but gave it its lowest rating, ""deceptive"", on funding transparency.[2]",401d30f531a0ca80521c82649298d67e359a2150,True,False,,,,,0,1652465667,,0,{},i8hco2u,True,t3_uoxskq,False,True,t3_uoxskq,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uoxskq/suboptimal_deterrence_slcmn_and_the_us_posture/i8hco2u/,1652465682,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652436867.0,

As it was the Russians successfully got entire battalions of AFV over to establish bridgeheads, the ops only failed because the bridges were destroyed, not because of counterattacks on the bridgeheads. How does extra light infantry to secure the bridgehead protect the bridge? What they needed was a means to hide the bridges, stop enemy from firing on them, or make them impervious to enemy fire. None of which is possible. 

Also, while a pontoon bridge is cheaper than a ballistic missile, its a limited resource. The Russians only have a certain amount of them. Also, every pontoon bridge piece has to be moved up with its own dedicated transport vehicles, with lots of engineers whose jobs it is to assemble it all. All needing dedicated combat troops to secure the crossing site as well as artillery units dedicated to try to suppress enemy around them. Each pontoon bridge also had its own dedicated combat units staging behind to cross them at a specific point and time, broken down into the assault elements and follow up forces using selected assembly areas. So we're not just talking about ""hey, send another bridge to AB123789 location,"" each bridgehead probably took weeks to plan and days to stage.  With them destroyed, they are back to the drawing board, minus possibly 2-3 BTGs who were effectively destroyed in the process, with who knows how many engineers also killed/wounded. 

I don't really know what Russian EW in the area might do. They might cut UA comms so the defenders in the immediate area can't talk to one another (who are using freq hopping comsec radios courtesy of the US), but how is that stopping a satellite or drone from seeing the bridge? Civilian satellites the twitter OSINT dudes are posting had spotted the pontoon bridges down to the meter, but the US satellites with imagery the UA are seeing can't? And how does EW stop UA drones? Can EW stop accurate UA artillery fire? Can they jam incoming Excalibur rounds or suicide drones or any other PGM that doesn't involve a ballistic missile?

Austin is a cabinet member, basically second most powerful in the US govt when it comes to this operation, so what he says is US policy. And that policy is to essentially destroy Russian military capabilities using Ukraine as a proxy. And so that is very serious rhetoric, as it firmly establishes what many suspected of the US but after his comment its not suspected anymore, its fact. And its potentially very escalatory, since now we're talking openly of not just defending Ukraine, we're attacking Russian national security assets at a strategic level, which past Russian nuclear policy has stated is grounds for them using nukes. 

However, the fact that the Pentagon is now telling American media that its trying to reach out to Russia for peace talks and that its none-other-than Austin calling his Russian rival, that's pretty significant too. Either it means Austin was just saber rattling before and was using it to pressure Russia to accept a ceasefire. 

Or else now he's trying to deescalate because the US govt realized it stuck its foot in its mouth, which is also a real possibility. The top level leaks from the last few weeks with the NYT story about US intel being intricate in the UA targeting of Russian strategic assets was also a major escalation. We know the White House panicked over the NTY time piece as the very next day they used more more official leak with the NBC story to state that the US govt is sharing intel but not colluding with the UA to go after any targets, not to kill their generals nor going after the Moskva. 

If they were also worried about Austin's comments that with the NYT story might have triggered a ""oh shit, we might have gone too far with the tough talk"" panic response, and Austin reaching out to Shoigu could just be a means of walking back his comments, as its a public gesture to the media to show the US policy is now peace talks and an immediate ceasefire, not the destruction of the Russian military. 

So the pick your poison. Either the US was playing 4D chess all along, or else they panicked because they realized they are about to start WW3 as they can't keep their mouths shut.

How would anyone take out every enemy defensive fires position within 20 miles?  Especially in that area where the UA were incredibly dense, with lots of arty. 

Russians were supposedly limited on drones, though I'm not sure. Same goes with UA drones, I know both are running a lot of them but I have no idea if they are subject to ADA threat or if they are nearly invincible. 

Even with them, finding all of the defenses would be impossible (a modern camo net not only hides them visually but also hides the heat signature). Even finding them doesn't guarantee they can destroy them. Their best chance is to try to suppress them with artillery fire while the crossing is ongoing. But any UA weapons platform with HE PGMs within range can destroy the crossing point, and at this point that can be nearly everything since PGMs are so plentiful and have extended range. Like I said, a long range missile fired from the rear could take out a pontoon bridge, like a ballistic missile or even a PGM fired from a MLRS. 

The Russians didn't seem to use an obscuration smoke mission to try to conceal the crossing, which is usually something done per doctrine. But, I'm not sure that the Russians possess the munitions to create a anti-infrared smoke screen that can defeat modern drone and satellite thermal imagery, If they didn't have them relying on regular smoke grenades wouldn't really help. Then again, without any smoke even the satellites that civilians can use plotted the bridges down to 1 meter accuracy, so military satellites and drones obviously saw them too.

Just off the top of my head, here are some ""solutions"" I'm pulling out of my ass: 

\- Try to do as many crossings as possible, to try to overwhelm attempts to destroy them all. 

\- Dummy crossings that are meant to be targeted to then find the locations of the firing sites that hit them. 

\- Try to use types of bridges that aren't easy to destroy as the pontoons the Russians are using. 

\- Make the bridges more mobile, and move them around multiple times a day, maybe even every hour, so at least they aren't stationary and easy to hit. PGMs need to be right on target to destroy them, if they move them 50 meters or so every time that might be enough to avoid a direct hit (at least if they're not using real time guidance provided by drones).

Maybe negotiations and a compromised solution with a cease fire to end the war was always the main objective of the US govt, with everything they said openly and did up this was just sound bytes and behind the scenes machinations to set up those conditions. 

Does that sound too crazy? That they used manipulation to get what they wanted, which differed from the extremist rhetoric used up until this point (including by Lloyd Austin)? 

Or is crazier to believe everything the US executive branch says publicly on pressers, during media interviews, or on Twitter is 100% truthful and to be taken completely at face value? 

Personally, and call me a cynic because I am one, but I always figured most of the over-the-top statements were a political attempt to both show resolve and demonstrate to the Russians as to what happens if this war continues: they can't win it, and they will end up destroying their military. That then incentivizes them to open lines of dialogue with both the UA and US, which would be the beginning of a series of talks designed to produce a compromise settlement where both Russia and UA make compromises. 

For instance, Russia might be willing to surrender everything they've taken it if means they keep what they controlled pre-war. And UA might be willing to accept that if the alternative is a long war that destroys their country to both stop the current Russian offensives and then spend years grinding away trying to retake all that ground before even getting to Crimea and the DPR/LPR, which might not go down willingly either. 

And RU and UA aren't the only ones who benefit for the war ending. I don't think the US executive branch wants this war to continue indefinitely, its very damaging to our own economy due to the oil war, and that is happening during an already horrible economic downturn, period of large inflation, crumbling jobs market, and continue collapse of supply chains that can't be blamed entirely on COVID anymore. We're spending money we don't have to spend, and giving away equipment we can't replace easily since its not like the ""Arsenal of Democracy"" has been turned on despite a Lend Lease bill; we're dipping into our own limited stockpiles, robbing Peter to pay Paul. 

What does the US get with the war continuing? It appeases the Slava Ukraini voter base, which isn't that large anyway. It gets to destroy Russian military ground capabilities, which has largely been accomplished (it'll take them the better part of a decade to recover from the damage they already took). They make Putin look weak, also accomplished. They strengthen NATO, also accomplished. 

The EU is doing even worse, as they were entirely reliant on Russian energy and that can't be altered for years. Germany already waivers a bit, and its only getting into summer.

Right now, this has gone beyond horribly. They’ve given up on several large encirclement (possibly even the Izyum axis too now) to encircle a smaller and smaller portion of units.

Worse still, their losing catastrophic amounts of armored units and men for kilometers. Not a good trade. 

Boris, multiple generals (NATO or otherwise), and a former Chinese ambassador (not that NATO) aligned have dim views of Russia’s success.

The success here isn’t the moving forward but encirclement or destruction of their foes. This isn’t being achieved if you just look at the pace of the battle. It’s plodding. Slow. Not nearly representative of any kind of overwhelming push. If the Ukrainians keep getting to reset into strongpoints every few kilometers or towns, and the cost is about 1 BTG per day or so (you can argue the accurate numbers, but denying that they’re not stalling because losses is absurd by this point) then Russia needs to consider its math because these are the best days it will get.

The Ukrainians are not fully prepared with their artillery yet. You can say they are lying but multiple corresponding reports (internally, US, UK, and Austrian analysts), they’re just getting set up. And the mud hasn’t dried yet.

Make matters worse, losing Kharkiv isn’t some wise maneuver but cutting losses. Which means that unless they want to come down for another run, they’re going to need to shuffle mauled units over to the main battle. But the Ukrainians who mauled them will probably be moving there too.

Not matter which side your emotionally biased toward, it’s best that you face the most likely estimates and sitreps of the war. The “moving forward is success” doesn’t match what Russia needs. They need an encirclement and need it soon. Pretending that they aren’t bleeding doesn’t work when their maulings are documented on the daily. They still have a chance for some success but if they keep throwing units forward, then it’s going to hit a point that even defensive operations will be in question because they’ll have such a lack of armor support, artillery advantage, and combat functional personnel (no they can’t just shove someone into a trench a day defend, it takes weeks to train a soldier, and even longer to train specialized ones) against very battle hardened, high morale Ukrainians.

We have plenty of reason to want to defend Taiwan that have jack shit to do with economics.

No, they don't. There are dozens of tech companies that make chips that have nothing to do with TSMC. Did you know that the F-16's mission computers are using CPUs from the early 2000s? The F-35's mission computers are running PowerPC chips from the early 2000s as well.

&gt;Taiwan is going to make a balance. They already have two fabrication plants in China. In the United States, they have one in Washington State and are building another in Arizona, due up in 2024. The remaining fab plants and their foundry, are in Taiwan proper. And that is also what helps keep Taiwan safe, because every other country also buys their chips from Taiwan.

Again, you are trying to equate everything to some economic motive, when the Chinese - with thousands of years of history, and a few hundred years of suffering to imperialism and colonialism - view this as an internal affair that has been long stymied by Western intervention. 

Why do you think they're arming up and building up to a fight? They're willing to start a massive war because they believe this is the culmination of hundreds of years of China going from decline, to civil war, to its rise back as one of the top civilizations on Earth.

Moreover, that's some seriously wishful thinking that everyone is going to join in to fight China. Europe is avoiding directly fighting Russia still, and Europe is even further away from Russia where they can't provide any meaningful force.

In addition, the Chinese economy is massive and now affects economies around the world. You want to talk economics? You tell me how many nations are going to sanction China. Lots in Africa and South America and the Middle East already aren't doing anything about Russia, and they're even less likely to given China's economic power in those areas.",2c24875f60063c8ad752e85adbb23283e7eaaea8,True,False,,,,,0,1652459205,,0,{},i8gwfq7,False,t3_unsuhc,False,True,t1_i8dpxz5,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/unsuhc/the_plas_evolving_outlook_on_urban_warfare/i8gwfq7/,1652459219,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652430405.0,

Their total is difficult to estimate due to the mobilisation, but Russian sources have been mentioning about 100k. So, about 2.6% of the army killed. Which means very heavy losses.

The number of permanently incapacitated wounded depends on a lot of factors, but at least 2.6% more.

That's the problem with calling a source unbiased - it's impossible to be entirely unbiased as a source in this war.  The amount of hard factual evidence available in real time is high, but not nearly high enough to construct a fully functional model or assessment of the war situation.  If you want to get anywhere (especially make something as detailed as a map with predictive elements), you have to make some assumptions from intuition, historical precedent, and/or inconclusive/unconfirmed testimony.  You just have to.  Even very cautious and conscientious analysts like Michael Kofman or Jomini have to occasionally base their analysis on primary but unconfirmed sources (i.e. statements from combatants without photo evidence), and primary sources in this war are virtually all biased.

So claiming someone is unbiased just makes both you and them seem giga sus.

Qualifies how confident they are in a prediction, or even better, which events would need to happen/be confirmed in order for a projection of theirs to be more/less likely to happen.

River crossings are an extremely difficult operation to conduct, one of the toughest, and the sat photos showing lots of RuGF vehicles jammed up near the doesn't exactly tell us when and why there were there. 

If the Russians deliberated massed AFV on the near side of the river by the entry point before the crossing point was even erected and the lead assault elements hadn't even crossed yet, then that was outright stupid. Even if they massed the follow-up forces next to the bridge as the leading assault element was establishing the bridgehead that too would be extremely foolish as their assembly areas should be further to the rear, especially when enemy fires haven't been suppressed let alone neutralized. 

However, those sat photos showing the ""pile ups"" were likely taken after the leading assault elements had already crossed at which point the UA dropped the bridges with fires, cutting off the advance party trying to establish a bridgehead and halting further efforts to cross. 

If true, at that point of the operation the next wave of Russian AFV that were part of the follow-on force would be have left their assembly area and been in the traffic jams to cross the bridge. I think that is why some AFV are visible in the water (having fallen off the bridge as it sank) while others are massed on the near side entry bank. 

With the bridge destroyed while more AFV were being moved towards it they would have had no place to go since turning back to the assembly area can't happen when its one big traffic jam of AFV moving toward a bridge that doesn't exist. At that point they would need to start branching off the road to gain some space so everyone can flip directions to drive back to the assembly area. However, that was while getting pounded with accurate artillery fires, which damaged many vehicles, probably killed/wounded a bunch of officers who had dismounted who were trying to unfuck the situation playing traffic op, and likely triggered a general retreat, possibly a rout, back to the assembly area with the rest of the running AFV and surviving personnel, with some AFV left there being destroyed, others mired in mud, and some just abandoned because it was faster to ditch them and run off then try to reverse them in a traffic jam under fire.",4cdebb7e87aaa0080d2e607a49df9e0a05e5c782,True,False,,,,,0,1652456347,,0,{},i8gp7w2,False,t3_uoq4bh,False,True,t1_i8ghr2d,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uoq4bh/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_13_2022/i8gp7w2/,1652456365,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652427547.0,

There have been attempted crossings in at least 3 locations, possibly 4 (the crossings shown in the above Nathan Ruser tweet + 1 more than may have been made today outside Pryvillya).

At one of the locations (Bilohorivka) they have attempted to cross 3 times. At all of the others 1 attempt each.

All of the attempts appear to have been defeated and bridges destroyed...with the exception of the new ""possible"" at Pryvillya being reported by Pro-Ru twitter today.

Although I agree with /u/hatesranged on this one.... I'm looking in FIRMS and I can see no fires in that area in the past day, and I'd expect to see several if there were ongoing fighting int he town+artillery barrages opposing/supporting the crossing.

The big losses were at those Bilhorivka crossings (2 initially were the big attack, 1 more crossing was attempted yesterday for either attack or vehicle recovery purposes but the bridge reportedly was destroyed early in that attempt).

There were also some losses at the bridge marked ""first crossing location"" in Natahn Rusers map above, they are the photos with a sunk pontoon, some vehicle losses, including some shots of ""3 electricity pylons in a row"" you can see on some of the images that allowed people to geo-locate it to that location.",ab66345b6027f10d147a91cccc6f6a4d75af81a5,True,False,,,,,0,1652455889,,0,{},i8go2z1,False,t3_uoq4bh,False,True,t1_i8gi0tz,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uoq4bh/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_13_2022/i8go2z1/,1652455903,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652427089.0,

This supposes a lot of things, that the EU were equally equipped to provide military support (they're not), that military aid is more valuable than other forms of aid (both are important and that there was no coordination in what was supplied.

Once the Russians are strategically tapped out, then initiative switches to the UA, and it'll be time for them to launch actual major counteroffensives on a scale unseen in this conflict so far. Not spoiling attacks like currently in Kharkiv, an attempt to press a Russian weak point to try to get them to peel off reserves away from the Severodonetsk salient, but  legitimate corps sized operational commands all attacking at once. 

Retaking Mariupol itself wont be a priority, especially since its effectively been destroyed. It never did hold that much of a strategic value, and especially since the Russians will still control the Sea of Azov there is no need to retake the port. 

As for retaking southern Ukraine, my guess is before a major counteroffensive to retake Kherson happens they will want to cut the landbridge running from Donetsk to Kherson through Zaporizhia oblasts, which means then Crimea can only be resupplied by the bridges in Kerch or by sea at Sevastopol. It really depends where this attack is launched against, a key terrain feature deciding it will be a north-south highway running deep into Zaporizhia oblast to the sea, which doesn't rule out Mariupol but could be a few other places. The decision will likely be based higher on the lack of Russian defenses in each specific area. Once the land bridge is cut, they'll probably want to lop off the Russians over the Dnieper in Kherson itself and then try to drive SW from staging areas in Dnipropetrovsk.

*Ukrainian Forces Hold the Line in Donbas as Western Heavy Weapons Join the Battle*

With Russia failing to achieve a strategic breakthrough, a long and bloody battle for eastern Ukraine looms

&gt; * More than three weeks after the massive Russian offensive that aims to encircle Ukraine’s best forces in Donbas kicked off on April 18, Moscow’s achievements so far are limited at best. In a Senate testimony this week, Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, the head of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, described the current stage of the war as a stalemate.

&gt; * Prospects for peace soon are slim, Ukrainian, Western and Russian officials say.

&gt; * “Our first task was to stop and destroy the enemy, but after that we have to liberate everything that they have taken from us. This will take time, at least the whole summer. It won’t be quick,” Pavlo Kyrylenko, the head of the Ukrainian military administration for Donetsk region, said in an interview. 

&gt; * This means that Russia’s only way of striking deep into Ukraine is via expensive cruise missiles launched from Russia, Belarus or ships in the Black and Caspian seas.

&gt; * Ukraine’s own air force, rarely seen in March and April, now frequently flies in the skies over Donbas once again, soldiers here say. On Wednesday, two Ukrainian Su-25 ground-attack jets roared just above emerald-green fields to hit targets on the front line in Donbas, and then sped back after their mission.

&gt; * In Maryinka, which abuts the western neighborhoods of Donetsk city, a Russian tank column Monday made yet another attempt to force its way into the village, where blooming orchards surround the crumpled skeletons of charred buildings and burned civilian cars dot the main road.

&gt; * The column was spotted by Ukrainian drones, hit by artillery, and then finished off by infantry armed with Javelin and NLAW missiles, said a reconnaissance officer of the Ukrainian Army’s 54th Brigade. The Ukrainian military released a video recording of the strike, which he said destroyed at least eight Russian tanks and armored vehicles.

&gt; * Ukraine’s successful resistance in Donbas has prompted the U.S. director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, to conclude in her testimony to the Senate on Tuesday that it is increasingly unlikely that Russia will be able to capture the entirety of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and establish a buffer zone around them in the coming weeks.

&gt; * “They keep coming like zombies: We destroy their troops, their armor, and then the new ones arrive. We cannot relax because the situation remains difficult and the enemy is very numerous,” he said. “But now we have proven that we’re able to not only halt but also defeat the enemy with quality, not quantity—no matter how numerous the enemy is.”",625385d6e2841bff7968563fb9d525914db77ce2,True,False,,,,,0,1652454418,,0,{},i8gkfys,False,t3_uoq4bh,False,True,t3_uoq4bh,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uoq4bh/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_13_2022/i8gkfys/,1652454436,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652425618.0,

&gt; * Dmitri’s refusal to fight highlights some of the military difficulties the Russian army has faced as a result of the Kremlin’s political decision not to formally declare war on Ukraine – preferring instead to describe the invasion, which will soon reach its fourth month, as a “special military operation”.

&gt; * Under Russian military rules, troops who refuse to fight in Ukraine can face dismissal but cannot be prosecuted, said Mikhail Benyash, a lawyer who has been advising soldiers who choose that option.

&gt; * “Commanders try to threaten their soldiers with prison time if they dissent, but we tell the soldiers that they can simply say no,” Benyash said, adding that he was not aware of any criminal cases against soldiers who refused to fight. “There are no legal grounds to start a criminal case if a soldier refuses to fight while on Russian territory.”

&gt; * “Putin needs to make a decision regarding mobilisation in the coming weeks,” said Rob Lee, a military analyst. “Russia lacks sufficient ground units with contract soldiers for a sustainable rotation. The troops are getting exhausted – they won’t be able to keep this up for a long period.”

&gt; * Andrei Kolesnikov, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment, said the authorities may be worried that a general mobilisation would antagonise large sections of the population that support the “special operation”.",1459652d2b92f37a09f1c364c0585d290bd34cc4,True,False,,,,,0,1652451578,,0,{},i8gdhd5,False,t3_uoq4bh,False,True,t3_uoq4bh,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uoq4bh/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_13_2022/i8gdhd5/,1652451590,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652422778.0,

------------

&gt; * …Indonesian defense minister Prabowo Subianto in January claimed “that in 24 months we will have up to 50 warships.” 

&gt; * The Indonesian Navy operates more than a hundred vessels, which quantitatively makes its fleet the largest in Southeast Asia. 

&gt; * Prabowo has signed contracts or declared plans for additional major combatants from France, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom. If realized entirely, the Indonesian navy would have up to 18 new frigates and corvettes, and 4 new submarines. The fleet could include eight Japanese Mogami-class frigates, two British Arrowhead 140 frigates, six Italian Bergamini (FREMM) frigates and two refurbished ex-Maestrale corvettes, and two to four French Scorpene submarines. They would bring Indonesia’s total fleet of new (or within 20 years of operational service) major combatants to 27 frigates and corvettes and 7 submarines, excluding the potential addition of 3 South Korean ex-Pohang corvettes. With the addition of old major combatants (about 23 in total), Prabowo’s figure would not be far off the mark.

&gt; * But there is another possibility. While Indonesia cannot possibly end up with a fleet of 50 new major combatants in 2024, it could nonetheless achieve this posture if the domestically built fast attack craft (FAC) fleet is added to the tally.

&gt; * The FAC provides a cost-effective solution to Indonesia’s “brown-water” naval responsibilities—coastal defense and security of strategic chokepoints, such as the Malacca Straits—that demand the service of small and agile platforms at affordable costs. Compared to the major combatants, the FAC’s simpler technological and mechanical designs allow Indonesia to sustain their lifecycles at local shipyards, which contributes to enhancing national defense “self-sufficiency”—a quintessential element in Indonesia’s strategy.

&gt; * To what extent these FACs are true “combatants” is questionable, however. Despite successful firing tests, most of Indonesia’s FACs  might be fitted for, but not with, anti-ship guided missiles, which Indonesia is also not yet capable of manufacturing. With Indonesia reliant on external suppliers for arming the FACs, questions linger over their long-term sustainability, especially when geopolitics intercedes. 

&gt; * Even with Prabowo’s intent to spend up to $125 billion on military modernization over the next 25 years, interceding factors—like inflation, CAATSA, Covid-19 and now, the war in Ukraine—have and could continue to upset pre-programmed plans.

In a country so large and ancient such an expedition, even if successful, is seen as insignificant in the grand scheme of things and even *expected*.

China’s position on Taiwan is largely an extension of its geopolitical struggle with the United States. China has parted with even larger stretches of territory, for example its agreement to end its border dispute with Russia - that is because there is no contest between China and post-Soviet Russia. Similarly, the Chinese public has virtually no reaction to the border dispute with India, because there’s no competition between China and India.

They feel passionately about Taiwan, however, because there *is* a competition between China and America, and America is occupying the spot that Chinese believes is their own. “Winning” in Taiwan is just part of the larger effort of “beating America” and proving that China is the greatest. This is the face of modern Chinese nationalism, and understanding it makes a lot more sense of the Chinese position in Taiwan.

USN predicted that China could retake Taiwan in days back in the early 2000s - why then did it not? Because beating Taiwan is not the same as asserting superiority over the United States. If Xi reconquers Taiwan but the PLAN loses to the US Navy, people will not cheer him on but condemn him. Their goal is not this or that disputed territory, it’s asserting “China’s rightful place in the world”, and an invasion that results in a blockade achieves the opposite.",49534ca4d3db4b8cad22e2009767b1719dd84b3e,True,False,,,,,0,1652449487,,0,{},i8g8n8w,False,t3_uof3qa,False,True,t1_i8f0o7u,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uof3qa/taiwan_and_the_dangerous_illogic_of_deterrence_by/i8g8n8w/,1652449503,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652420687.0,

I'm not immediately persuaded by this announcement that their opposition is a real thing. First, Turkey's concerns here were predictable. The idea that this hasn't been considered seems unlikely to me. Second, unanimity aside, the USA really seems to call the shots in NATO, I'm skeptical that any non-nuclear powers enjoying the protection of the US nuclear umbrella are going to flip the boat on an issue like this. Especially non-nuclear frontliners like Turkey.

My predictions are that (1) this gets resolved quickly, and (2) this gets resolved by negotiations and possibly concessions by the US, rather than Sweden or Finland.

Going into the detail of each countries politics and the nature of their support is too broad a subject for this post but there are simple metrics we can look at to get an understanding of what different countries are doing to support Ukraine; the monetary value of their support and that value relative to their GDP. Thankfully this is all recorded by the Institute for the World Economy, their findings are detailed here:  
  
https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/  
  
They update their data twice a month with the latest data being from 02 May, their next update is due on the 18th. Looking through their data we find the following of interest.  
  
Unsurprisingly the US is the largest individual donor with €10.3b pledged in both military and financial aid but, as a group, the EU has donated more with a total of €12.8b of aid pledged.  
  
The second biggest individual donor is Germany with €3.6b (figures include money donated via the EU). The other major donors are Poland (€2.7b), the UK (€2.1b), Canada (€1.9b), France (€1.8b) and Italy (€1.2b). Another 16 countries have pledged between €100m and €1b in support.  
  
Already the narrative that certain EU countries are wavering in their support to Ukraine can be seen to be problematic. This narrative only become more problematic when we factor in GDP.  
  
When we look at aid as a proportion of GDP the real superheroes quickly float to the surface, Eastern European countries directly threatened by Russia dominate the list with Latvia and Estonia pledging around 0.8% of their GDP in support of Ukraine. Looking at the major donors Poland are 3rd on the list (0.49%), Canada are 7th (0.13%), Germany 9th (0.1%), the UK 13th (0.08%), France 17th (0.07%), Italy 19th (0.7%) and the US 29th (0.05%).

[],False,,Patchwork-Chimera,,,[],,,,text,t2_l1jaq98w,False,True,"The PLA's approach to urban warfare is simply not to fight there. In the case of Taiwan, the island nation imports 98+% of its energy, is incredibly foreign-dependent on imports for nearly all products, can be taken off the bulk of global telecommunications through severing the handful of undersea cables, is concentrated into an extremely small area (practically the entire population lives in a handful of Urban centers on the Northwest, Southwest, and mid-West), relies on highly vulnerable infrastructure to maintain a livable quality of life, and hosts many times more people than can hope to survive on Taiwanese agricultural output in the best of circumstances (\~33% caloric self sufficiency). 

I really hate typing this stuff over and over again, but in my entire career in OA, I haven't come across a single scenario in which a rapid invasion of Taiwan is the best course of action for the PLA - and most of the folks I work with in the community will tell you that it's unlikely to be how they seek to conduct themselves (which also sheds a lot of light on their seemingly incoherent procurement strategy, if their goal is simply to get their force across the strait and to conduct a joint amphibious campaign). It's mostly dimwits like Ian ""Ballistic Missiles are Overpriced Artillery Rounds"" Easton and groups that are essentially just playing out the line to conduct OA with it that take the ""million man swim with chinese characteristics"" seriously.

If the United States stays out of the fight, the Taiwanese can be de-clawed with prompt precision fires, have their infrastructure knocked out through the myriad other offensive fires platforms in PLA inventory, then can be positively blanketed with UAS coverage due to the PLA's already extensive and currently growing MALE/HALE fleet, can have their ports blockaded, terminals and ship handling facilities put out of action, and near-seas mined. The PLA can take outlying islands such as Kinmen, Matsu, and Taiping with airborne, air-mobile, and amphibious forces. The main Island can simply be left to atrophy and left to endure what remains of its forces being picked off, the living conditions turn into squalor, and the population slowly go hungry and thirsty until either the PLA believes they are weak enough to not present significant resistance to ground component employment, or until they outright surrender. This will all be under a constant barrage of ""if you end this, life will go back to how it was. you will eat a warm meal, you will drink crystal clear cool water, you will enjoy air conditioning, you will have electricity, your toilet will flush, you will have medical supplies, you will make a phone call; you will have it all back if you simply lay your arms down."" Islands don't survive blockades. Especially not islands overpopulated by well educated, first world, unable-to-fight-back men and women that come from a society of free speech in which surrender is a practical death sentence, and where after a handful of weeks, there will only be one kind of meat left on the island. 

If the United States *does* intervene (and we likely will), we will not stop fighting just because the PLA lands troops on Taiwan. In no reality does the US initiate kinetic action against the PLA, but then say 'oh oops show's over"" if/when Taipei falls and the PRC claims it as ""liberated."" If we get into a shooting fight, it will keep going until one side can no longer shoot back. Furthermore, if the PLA were to stall significantly in Taiwan during an attempted rapid invasion, the US would no doubt seize upon the opportunity to contain and resist the Chinese invasion. The PLA is *hugely* incentivized to gear up not for a land war with Taiwan, but for an Air/Sea war with the United States and Co. 

Because of this, the PLA is, again, still best served by exploiting Taiwan's practically non-existent longevity in a time of war by (*to go through it again)*, disabling the Taiwanese capability to generate fires impeding PLA operations, cripple Taiwanese power/connectivity/water/rail/port/etc. industries, employ large quantities of UAS to maintain a persistent target-of-opportunity engagement capability, and then to commit the bulk of PLA forces against the US and coalition allies. Spending a large amount of time telegraphing an amphibious invasion against an enemy that is in the strongest state it'll be at during the war (that is to say, the beginning), giving them the time to dig in, fortify, and make preparations for the oncoming assault, letting all the attritional and resource advantages be flipped on its head by making a port-less Taiwan go from ""hey sweet now they're blockaded"" to ""shit we can no longer supply our invasion force,"" making Taiwanese urbanization go from ""hey they cannot support their population, just let them fall apart"" into ""we have to rapidly, casualty-intensively clear this massive, complex-terrain laden region,"" turning the massive flat plains that inhibit free movement of Taiwanese forces due to aerial surveillance assets into massive killing fields for Taiwanese spotters in concealed positions dialing in fires on PLAGF formations, and turning the Taiwanese inability to so much as *touch* the PLA while they conduct Air/Naval ops into not only an ability to touch, but an ability to existentially threaten PLA forces by committing the *one* portion of the PLA to the *one* scenario in which they may be defeated.... is just utterly and completely bonkers. It's a horrible terrible no good very bad idea, and it is so obviously superseded in effectiveness by so many other courses of action that the fact people consider it ""realistic"" is kind of a sad example of how some people, when they pick a side to root for, won't stop for a moment and think about what the other side can do to stack the deck in their favor.

2. If Taiwan made a deal for a US military base and security guarantees, then again, the CCP could not invade, as doing so would be a DOW on the US, and the CCP would get stomped quite easily by the US now, and in the foreseeable future.

3. If Taiwan declared independence, the CCP would not dare to declare a war it was not confident it could win. So it would not declare war now, or in the near future.

That's not reasonable. That's like saying ""why die for Danzig?"" to argue against stopping Hitler in WW2. 

The truth is that the CCP is the major threat to world peace of the 21st century. It WILL inevitably attempt to empire-build through military aggression, just like Putin did, but on a much larger scale, more akin to Hitler. Nobody with a functioning brain thinks the CCP will eat Taiwan, become satisfied, and stop. 

Taiwan is to the CCP, like Czechoslovakia was to Hitler. A mere stepping stone on a path to world conquest. 

The ONLY reasonable path, is to stop the CCP immediately and totally upon its first war of aggression, no matter who its initial target is, though it will very likely be Taiwan.

**""We should withdraw military support from Taiwan, let the CCP conquer it, and just make ambiguous threats of sanctions instead""**

It's always the mark of genius to recommend a strategy immediately after it has failed, such as how this exact strategy utterly failed to deter Russia from invading Ukraine.

&gt;Although there are many compelling reasons to prefer that Taiwan remain democratic and retain its affinity with the West, these outcomes are not so vital as to merit a strategy for which the immediate consequence of failure is high-end war with a nuclear-armed adversary.

translation: ""I'm scared of fighting China, so let's just let them eat Taiwan"". 

If this idiot was in charge of US policy, the 1st thing China would do is say ""your threatened sanctions will be treated as an act of war"". OOPS. Now her whole premise - that you can sanction other countries with 0 risk of military escalation - goes completely out the window, and she's forced to back down.

&gt;A strategy of deterrence by punishment, by comparison, is pragmatic. It retains options for U.S. policymakers even if it fails

No it does not. If you let China conquer Taiwan, and then sanctions fail, there is nothing left. No ""options"" except to launch a war of liberation, which is clearly not an option at all, since it is far less palatable than a war of defense, which was already rejected in favor of sanctions.

&gt;it neither produces immediate war, nor precludes a subsequent decision to go to war either to defend against or to expel an aggressor.

The ""immediate war"" happens regardless, only the cowardly US admin sits on the sidelines. And any US admin too cowardly to defend Taiwan against CCP aggression, would certainly not decide to INITIATE a war of aggression against the CCP after having betrayed Taiwan and having allowed it to fall. 

&gt;So too is there reason for measured optimism that deterrence by punishment will work.

Except that it just failed against Russia a matter of months ago. 

&gt;The United States has real leverage, and an increasingly resolute set of partners, with which to convince China that aggression will be enormously costly. 

Nobody can be described as ""increasingly resolute"" if they stand idly by and allow a free democracy like Taiwan to fall to the Chinese Communist Party.

Anyway, Nathan Rusewr thinks he's located that crossing on Sat imagery. No pontoon bridge, but signs of extensive shelling of the south bank of the river there appeared on the 12th... (Map in linked tweet).

Also, the claims concerning the AFV/T-72 boneyard on Russophile twitter/our favourite copium dealer this morning is that half/most of those wrecks are UA equipment from a previous attempting crossing at that point going in the other direction.

Left unexplained in this explanation for the wrecks is...

a) Any indication from any party a UA crossing happened.

b) Why Russia didn't crow about blasting a big UA crossing to pieces a week ago when it was alleged to have happenned 

c) Any open source Sat pics of any pontoons there prior to the defeated Ru crossing

d) Any explanation as to why 90% of the wreckage is on the UA bank, as you'd assume (as with the Ru crossing) destroyed vehicles would be prevalent on the bank being assaulted as artillery is called down once the opposittion realise a crossing is underway.

https://www.cnas.org/press/in-the-news/the-us-may-be-using-ukraine-as-a-blueprint-for-how-taiwan-could-stop-a-chinese-invasion

I know the word Ukraine does not seem to come up often in the actual policy brief, but reading between the lines, it is nothing but using the idea that the Ukraine conflict as it is unfolding now with a weaken Russia is how a Taiwan conflict is going to go down, so arming Taiwan like Ukraine would be punishment in that heads, China does not invade, United States wins by keeping the First Island chain; tails, China does invade, United States wins by severely punishing China and possibly weakening it like Russia is getting in Ukraine.

I can see how that is attractive to the current Biden administration and is being bounced around at state and defense and adjacent think tanks and policy circles, but I think this is just the hyper current version of generals fighting the last war(or generals planning future wars on basis on current unfinished one). This sounds like political and policy cover for Biden to move towards a situation where United States starts supplying Ukraine mixture of weapons to Taiwan while changing American's policy preference from status quo in Taiwan strait to maybe you can have a war there, as long as China is weaken enough, so I dare y'all. It sounds like the middling middle ground someone like a centrist Biden might pursue, it is status quo enough since you are not opening the arm sale flood gates to Taiwan nor giving a direct America protection umbrella, but fine turning the policy to make sure America comes out on top while bearing minimal cost. However, the fatal flaw is China is not Russia, Russia has been a declining power while China is a rising one, and the geography of the resulting conflicts are very different as well as the internal dynamics.

I guess it is insightful and probably revealing what some Americans policymakers are thinking and probably as good counterpoint to current American deterrence by denial as you can get.

However, the US doesn't risk annexation nor destruction, and can use any Chinese invasion as a pretext to start its own war, which given the current balance of power would allow it to punish China and possibly cause an economic collapse by enforcing an embargo.

The problem with this type of judgement is that none of us know what world leaders are thinking, especially since Chinese leaders tend not to be too talkative to media anyways.

With that being said, I do agree that many people miss the mark on WHY China wants to annex Taiwan. It isn't because of computer chips or some sort of economic benefit (a war will almost certainly be detrimental no matter how it goes) but rather because China genuinely considers Taiwan to be part of China; it's very much part of the national identity.

Many Americans remember the phrase (or at least should) ""millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute"" famously spoken during the XYZ Affair against French demands for a bribe. This gist was that national pride and identity are sacrosanct over mere financials and that the US was willing to go to war in order to defend its dignity. There are countless parallels to this both in American and world history in which people willingly sigh up at the risk of death to fight for what they believe is right and just.

Read the actual text of the Sino-Briisth Joint Declaration, it leaves enough ambiguity as to the system of governance, nothing there suggests full democratic rule or that Beijing couldn't legislate on national security matters, it was just strongly hinted that Beijing won't. Remember we are talking about the crown colony of Hong Kong where the colonial governor was appointed by the British crown in London with no input whatsoever by the people of Hong Kong, and that person has executive, legislative, and judicial power all rolled into one while being commander-in-chief of the British forces in Hong Kong. Westminster Parliament had the power legislate directly for Hong Kong and did so, with the local Legislative Assembly enacting more inferior forms of legislation though the Colonial Laws Validity Act and the nonrepugnancy principle ensured that local laws were always the main body of law with respect to Hong Kong.

Successive Chinese governments considered Hong Kong ""a Chinese sovereign territory under British administration"" and so China would always enjoy a sort of privileged position in Hong Kong despite the cession, Chinese subjects were not subject to immigration/border controls and could freely take up residence and jobs in the colony(Beijing protested when London imposed such controls in the aftermath of the Chinese civil war and unrest from the cultural revolution) as long as the person was not deemed a security risk by the British authorities to expel. China, in theory but not in practice by then, could keep a garrison in the Kowloon city walls. China establishment of diplomatic relationship with Britain saw China not establishing a consulate in Hong Kong but rather using to Xinhua Hong Kong branch as liaison mechanism as a wink wink both sides know that their positions are on paper incompatible.

The imposition of national security legislation is perhaps comparable to the British reaction after the riots of 1967 in Hong Kong, and if anything, that serves to show that China is keeping Hong Kong's existing form of government as the form of government during the British colonial era was an executive dominance system with a colonial governor appointed from London and ruled by buy in from sectorial commerical interest by the local elites that have links to London. Perhaps the issues is China won't explain it in such terms and the West is ready to jump on the violation bandwagon, but a more sobering analysis reveals more deep seated power dynamics and rationales. The greatest change is perhaps the exclusion of another balancing outside party since Chinese authorities were ever present in the British consideration for Hong Kong, but now, China sought to exclude any British influence on the governance system even before the stated 50 years mark. Though one must realise that the Sino-British declaration has no formal role for Britain after the transfer and Britain is not in the position of China with respect to British Hong Kong as the distance alone makes such influence untenable.

But bad history and revisionism perhaps cloud our judgement of such historical events given the recent polarisation on the Hong Kong issue. I do say this, power dynamics is more important a consideration than some piece of paper with Beijing. Beijing is not known for its spirit for going the extra mile to respect contracts, but will use every excuse to forge a favorable position.as the power dynamics change, though the reality is black and white language does serve as forms of status quo preservers, and Beijing is not keen to openly flout stuff written on black and white, which I argued here that Beijing has not done with respect to Hong Kong.",1dd59ed87d3ccbdbae8c5e124b51b48433370a2a,True,False,,,,,0,1652418376,,0,{},i8ezcnc,False,t3_uof3qa,False,True,t1_i8e7ati,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uof3qa/taiwan_and_the_dangerous_illogic_of_deterrence_by/i8ezcnc/,1652418390,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652389576.0,

Therefore the model makes inaccurate predictions when the dominant forces at play are these missing factors. 

The issue I have with Mearsheimer is that in stead of admitting that his model is incomplete in some cases, he tends to blame the world for not conforming to the model.

If Russia is unable to properly encircle or break through Severodonetsk (or anywhere else notable) within the next 2 weeks, their entire Donbas offensive will come to a halt.

Outside of that, they can still theoretically threaten Zaporizhya (Mariupol units are being refitted for an offensive there, reportedly), and they will probably try to secure the rest of Kherson Oblast, but that's about all I can see them muster up. Mykolaiv/Odesa still seems like a pipe dream.

Reasoning:

- Russia's wider encirclement from Izyum has been put on pause in favor of reinforcing the Severodonetsk encirclement, and there's anecdotal evidence of units shifting farther East.

- Ukraine is in a position to threaten Izyum supply lines after a successful offensive north of Kharkiv

- RU troops around Rubizhne/Popasna have been fighting for almost 2 months non-stop. I have doubts about how much they can afford to attack fortified defenses while suffering crazy losses.

- Russia's most combat effective troops are arguably the ones in the South, in direction of Mykolaiv and Zaporizhya, because they have not seen as much action.",1ee6ddb665a82d8b0463880bb052b8a87461b58a,True,False,,,,,0,1652412123,,0,{},i8eo26y,False,t3_unzexc,False,True,t3_unzexc,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/unzexc/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_12_2022/i8eo26y/,1652412141,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652383323.0,

Analysts say the outcome of fighting now is riding on the accuracy, quantity and the striking power of long-range weapons. Ukraine is pleading for more.

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/12/world/ukraine-russia-weapons.html

Through binoculars, the Ukrainian soldiers can see the Russian position far in the distance. But the single artillery weapon they operate at a small, ragtag outpost on the southern steppe has insufficient range to strike it.

These circumstances have imposed a numbingly grim routine on the Ukrainians, who are pounded daily by Russian artillery salvos while having no means to fight back. Every few hours, they dive into trenches to escape shells that streak out of the sky.

“They have our position fixed, they know where we are,” said Sgt. Anatoly Vykhovanets. “It’s like we are in the palm of their hand.”

As President Volodymyr Zelensky makes almost daily pleas to the West for heavier artillery, it is positions like the one here on the west bank of the Dnipro River that most illustrate how critical that weaponry is for Ukraine. Military analysts say the battle now is riding not so much on the skill or bravery of Ukrainian soldiers, but on the accuracy, quantity and striking power of long-range weapons.

The artillery capability of the two armies near Pryvillia is so lopsided in Russia’s favor that Ukrainian officials have specifically highlighted the region to Western officials and members of the U.S. Congress in their appeals for more military support.

In response, Western allies have been trying to rush artillery systems and associated equipment into Ukraine, and it is starting to arrive. But not as quickly as Ukrainian officials have wanted, especially in places like this small outpost in the south.

The United States announced plans to send 90 M777 American howitzers, a system capable of shooting 25 miles with pinpoint accuracy, but it was only this week that the first one in this region was fired in combat, according to a video the military provided to a Ukrainian news outlet.

Other American weapons Ukraine is counting on include drones for spotting targets and correcting artillery fire and tracked armored vehicles used for towing howitzers into position even under fire.

On Monday President Biden signed an updated version of the Lend-Lease Act, which would allow transfers of additional American weaponry to Ukraine, and on Tuesday night the House of Representatives approved a $40 billion aid package.

But for now at the outpost of Ukraine’s 17th Tank Regiment, in a tree line between two fields, the most soldiers can do is try to survive.

To do so, they appoint a listener around the clock. He stands, like a prairie dog on guard, in the center of the unit, listening for the distant boom of Russian outgoing artillery. The warning is “air!” Soldiers have about three seconds to dive into a trench before shells hit.

The Ukrainian Army does fire back from artillery operating to the rear of this position but has too few weapons to dislodge the Russian gun line.

Throughout the war, Ukraine’s army has demonstrated extraordinary success in outmaneuvering and defeating Russian forces in the north, relying on stealth and mobility to execute ambushes against a bigger, better equipped army. But in southern Ukraine, in an area of pancake-flat farm fields cut by irrigation canals, the Ukrainians are fighting a different sort of war.

On the steppe, the swirling, fluid front lines of the two armies are spaced miles or dozens of miles apart, over an expanse of gigantic fields of yellow rapeseed, green winter wheat, tilled under black earth and tiny villages.

Occasionally, small units slip into this buffer zone to skirmish, and to call in artillery strikes on one another, using sparse tree lines as cover. “There is no place to hide,” the commander of a reconnaissance brigade who is deploying units into these fights, said in an interview. He asked to be identified only by his nickname, Botsman.

“It’s like looking down at a chess board,” he said. “Each side sees the other sides’ moves. It just depends on what striking force you have. Everything is seen. The only question is, can you hit that spot?”

Soldiers on both sides call artillery guns that can do just that by a nickname, “the gods of war.”

Ukraine entered the war at a disadvantage. Russia’s 203-millimeter Peony howitzers, for example, fire out to about 24 miles while Ukraine’s 152-millimeter Geocent guns fire 18 miles. (Soviet legacy artillery systems, used by both sides, are named for flowers; Carnation and Tulip guns are also in play in the war.)

That’s why Ukrainians so desperately want the American howitzers; their 25-mile range while firing a GPS-guided precision round would, in some places, tilt the advantage slightly back to them.

“The Russians have two advantages now, artillery and aviation,” said Mykhailo Zhirokhov, the author of a book about artillery combat in the war against Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, “Gods of Hybrid War.” “Ukraine needs artillery and antiaircraft missiles. These are the critically important on the front.”

Finland’s NATO membership bid. Finland’s leaders announced their support for the nation to join the alliance, while Sweden is expected to do the same within days. The Kremlin said that Finland’s possible accession was a threat and that Russia would “take necessary measures” to protect itself.

On the ground. Ukrainian and Western officials said Russia is reportedly withdrawing forces from around Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, where it has been losing territory. The officials said Moscow may redirect troops to the southeast, where Russian troops are making greater progress.

Civilian killings. The United Nations human rights chief said that the bodies of more than 1,000 civilians, including several hundred who were summarily executed, have been recovered in areas near Kyiv that were occupied by Russian forces in the early stages of the invasion.

American aid. The House voted 368 to 57 in favor of a $39.8 billion aid package for Ukraine, which would bring the total U.S. financial commitment to roughly $53 billion over two months. The Senate still needs to vote on the proposal.

The Ukrainian military has insufficient quantity of even medium-range artillery, such as weapons that might hit back at the Russian gun line harassing the Ukrainian unit about nine miles away. The Russians are in a rock quarry, visible through binoculars as a gray smudge in the distance.

Hundreds of craters pock the fields all around. The soldiers operate a short-range, anti-tank artillery gun of little use against the Russian position that is out of range.

But the soldiers still serve a purpose: they can stop a tank assault using their short-range anti-tank artillery weapon, preventing Russian advances — so long as they endure the daily barrages. So far, nobody in the unit has been wounded or killed. That leaves the front in stasis, following two months in which Ukrainian forces advanced about 40 miles in this area.

Russia cannot capitalize on its artillery superiority to advance. Its tactic for attacking on the open plains is to hammer the opposing positions with artillery, then send armored vehicles forward on a maneuver called “reconnaissance to contact” aimed at overwhelming what remains of the defensive line.

But because of Ukraine’s wealth of anti-armor missiles and weapons, Russia cannot advance and seize ground.

Ukraine, meanwhile, also cannot advance, though its tactics differ. The Ukrainian military relies on small unit infantry with armored vehicles playing only supporting roles. Though Ukraine could seize ground, it could not hold it or use it for logistical support for further advances, as any new territory would remain under Russian bombardment.

The planned Ukrainian advance in this area depends on the arrival of the M777 howitzers and other long-range Western artillery that can hit the Russian artillery in the rear. Then, Ukrainian infantry might advance under the artillery umbrella of these longer range systems.

Should more powerful artillery arrive, it could quickly tip the scales, said Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Mr. Zelensky’s chief of staff.

In the fighting on the west bank of the Dnipro River, Russia’s objective appears to be tying down Ukrainian forces that might otherwise shift to the battle for the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.

Ukraine’s goal, once it obtains artillery able to match the range of Russian guns, is to move over the fields to within striking range of two bridges and a dam crossing the Dnipro River in an operation that could cut supply lines of the Russian forces, Mr. Arestovich, the presidential adviser, said.

“We would do it with pleasure,” said Col. Taras Styk, a commander in the 17th Tank Brigade. “But now we have nothing that can hit them.”",a2508f75c6b6fb503ca6541220847cf4785747a8,True,False,,,,,0,1652409761,,0,{},i8ej6uc,False,t3_unzexc,False,True,t3_unzexc,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/unzexc/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_12_2022/i8ej6uc/,1652409773,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652380961.0,

This has been pretty clear for at least a week now. It actually says a lot about how poorly the Russian advance has been going.

Because lot of academics are dumb and/or view America as a sole global threat to the peace and would rather repeat Russian propaganda than look at the situation rationally. Ok let's say everything is Russian propaganda is true, there was a smoke-filled room in the pentagon where Clinton and DoD hatchet up a plan to incorporate every post-soviet republic into its (defensive) alliance. FOR WHAT? 

To somehow convince every member of the defensive alliance to conduct a naked war of aggression against Russia? A nuclear power? For what exactly? Thousands of miles of Siberia? Will that become the 51st state? It's ludicrous.  And the whole notion of America somehow needing land access to conquer Russia is equally so. Soviets were badly losing the military tech race by the 80s. If America wanted to, they could have conquered Russia all on their own anytime in last 20 years. America has already won, there is no ideological battle anymore, (pretend) communism of USSR is dead. Russia has nothing except natural resources which they are happy to sell to the West and West is happy to buy.

Well, why then expand Nato? Why not? Nato provides immense benefits to America and all it's members, not just because of article 5, but standardization, shared military R&amp;D, training, sharing of doctrines and learning from each other. If the countries joining do so only because they fear Russia might one day invade them, so what. And Nato provides stability among its members, there is never going to be another war in balkans again as long Nato exist, which is a great thing.

[Clinton put it well](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/04/bill-clinton-nato-expansion-ukraine/629499/) when he said they tried to include Russia as much as possible but were prepared for the worst if ugly side of Russia might rear it's head again (and there were signs of it already with Chechnya). America genuinely tried to reach its hand and be friendly with Russia. There absolutely was a path towards Russia joining Nato and maybe it would have happened if someone more reasonable took hold of power after Yeltsin.

Putin may be smart when it comes to political intrigue, but he is fundamentally a simpleton. He views the idea of greatness as having more land, more territory to control, a ludicrous simplistic view of the world that died in the 20th century but he can't let it go. It doesn't matter that Russia, the biggest country in the world with 150mil people has an economy smaller than that of South Korea, no more land, Russia stronk! No, Nato is not any kind of threat to Russia as a country, it is a threat to Russian revanchism and irredentism. That's the one and the only reason. If Nato and EU never extended their hand to post-soviet republics and totally ignored them, tanks right now would be rolling in Warsaw, Prague, Riga and other territories nationalists like Putin view as ""theirs"".

[],False,,krakenchaos1,,,[],,,,text,t2_a0f2f01t,False,False,"I think what paper doesn't address are these:

* What cost is China actually willing to pay?

The current leadership of China is relatively risk adverse with its military, with almost zero affinity for any military adventures. If/when this changes, then does this change the amount of risk, either militarily or economically, that the government of China is willing to take? Are the costs that the US can impose actually enough to deter?

* What will be the domestic and international response to this type of policy?

The author takes a reasonable stance that American service members should not have to die for Taiwan, but the nature of a ""deterrence via punishment"" is that the punishment comes after the action. It's essentially a game of chicken. What if China bites the bullet and invades Taiwan? America would then impose its punishment, and then what? What negative repercussions for America's image, both with Americans at home and internationally if America's punishment hurts China but doesn't actually dislodge it from annexing Taiwan?

Looking at the behavior of America and some European countries with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, I've noticed that both the economic and military assistance to Ukraine has gradually grown. It seems like leaders are in a race on how they can help Ukraine and punish Russia better as not to appear weak or indecisive. IMO the escalation on behalf of Ukraine, or at least the appearance of it, shows that the US could not be content with some sort of economic punishment for China, and there is no guarantee that it would actually be effective either.

This of course leads to some high potential risks for both China and the US. If China pulls the trigger, it risks various levels of defeat at the hands of the US; the destruction of its military, a blockade leading to economic issues, you get the idea. Similarly, the US risks a military intervention failing and the loss of military assets if it acts with with its military or appearing weak and ineffective if it does not and economic sanctions do not reverse a successful invasion.",e3919ce263cd5293b2af2ffeb40d8e1eb9233ca5,True,False,,,,,0,1652409070,,0,{},i8ehqxa,False,t3_uof3qa,False,True,t3_uof3qa,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uof3qa/taiwan_and_the_dangerous_illogic_of_deterrence_by/i8ehqxa/,1652409085,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652380270.0,

Key Takeaways

Russian forces made marginal gains to the north of Severodonetsk and have likely captured Rubizhne and Voevodivka.

Russian forces fired intensively on Ukrainian positions in northern Kharkiv to stop the ongoing Ukrainian counteroffensive around Kharkiv City. The artillery focus on Ukrainian positions has likely diverted the Russian artillery that remains in range of Kharkiv to the more urgent task of stopping the Ukrainian advance.

Russian forces are strengthening their position on Snake Island in an effort to block Ukrainian maritime communications and capabilities in the northwestern Black Sea on the approaches to Odesa.",30ecc8bc4822a61658507993ef6827acccd32053,True,False,,,,,0,1652407955,,0,{},i8efe8q,False,t3_unzexc,False,True,t3_unzexc,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/unzexc/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_12_2022/i8efe8q/,1652407968,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652379155.0,

&gt;Russia isn’t that poor. They are 6th by GDP PPP

PPP is useless and stupid as a metric. It just exists to make poor countries look less poor than they really are, because of low labor costs. But an iPhone or a microprocessor costs the same everywhere, and that's what matters when you are comparing nations in a macro level. 

Also it's kindof a joke that you would cite GDP PPP and not cite PER CAPITA, which as I stated, Russia ranks 68th. Russia is 60th in per capita on PPP so it doesn't help your case. Not using per capita just means russia has a bigger POOR population. 

&gt;and do manufacture lots of stuff (weapons of all types, metallurgy, some cars and electronics as well)

Russia manufactures shit quality products and has to import the vast majority of its non-shit-tier consumer goods. Using oil revenues. The #1 car in Russia by market share is the Hyundai Solaris. The #1 car brand in Russia by far is Renault-Nissan. Russia's consumer goods exports are near-zero because nobody wants their shit tier products. They're just a raw material exporter. Jet engines to China is a dwindling and very small trade volume in the grand scheme of things.

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"Just to clarify. 

Fires are always a major part of all ground operations, either direct fire weapons ranging from shoulder fired rockets, grenade launchers, or tank cannons, to indirect fire such as mortars, tube arty, or rocket artillery, to aerial bombs, air to ground missiles, aerial rockets, etc. How much fires are used especially during offensive ops is a mix of doctrine, organization, logistics, location, necessity, and issues like collateral damage. 

The older approach to urban warfare used by pretty much every major power during and since WW2 was to either bypass urban centers altogether to avoid fighting in them, or a rely on a fires centric approach that relied on artillery especially to destroy most of the structures, especially those identified as enemy positions, while advancing ground troops were used to ""mop up."" 

However, there were major weaknesses in that doctrine. Its incredibly slow, its incredibly costly in terms of logistics, and it often doesn't work, as skilled enemy who are motivated to fight on can take advantage of the rubbled urban terrain to benefit them. Which means regardless of fires, the ""mop up"" assault elements still end up doing most of the work in terms of clearing the urban areas, and taking very heavy casualties. A good comparison is that the heavy fires doctrine used in WW2 and Cold War urban warfare are near identical to the week to month long long artillery barrages done in the early parts of WW1 before major ground attacks were done; major preparatory fires preceding a ground attack to allow the infantry to have a cake walk attack where they face little to no resistance. The assumptions are still the same between the WW1 trench warfare and the WW2 and beyond fires centric urban fire plans, that the fires were supposed to do all the work. And like WW1, the assumptions often failed. 

Beyond tactical and logistical limitations there are other concerns, namely that modern international law conflicts with the older doctrines to destroy urban area with heavy fires due to civilian population being targeted, and because warfare is more visible than ever before due to mass media, and because ethics and mindsets about suffering among noncombatants have changed, it means that collateral damage is now a major factor when it comes to all military operations, but especially in urban areas which are only defined as urban because of the high concentration of people living in such small areas. Many military forces have had to alter doctrine to deal with those realities. Though, in all honesty when the shit hits the fan and they face determined enemy dug in like ticks even they too have to resort back to a heavy fires to reduce hard points. But that said, the basic concept is that the more they care about protecting infrastructure and noncombatants, the more precision and restraint they need to exercise when using fires. At least until shit hits the fan and they are either moving too slow or taking too many casualties so the senior brass ""takes the gloves off.""

Russia has had only very limited experience in urban warfare since WW2 and rely on much of the older doctrine. They had very limited opportunities during the Cold War when crushing various Eastern European revolutions, mainly Budapest 1956, and their mechanized maneuver doctrine focused on bypassing to a degree that urban ops weren't even really taught. Post Cold War, the debacles in Grozny during the 1st and 2nd Chechen Wars exposed major weaknesses in their doctrine, organization, logistics, and execution, with the only ""success"" actually occurring during the opening of the 2nd Chechen with the 3rd battle of Grozny, a siege that ultimately destroyed most of the city but saw a significant number of the rebel escape to fight another day, turning what was supposed to be a short invasion to crush resistance into a decade plus long insurgency. Additionally, they also had some experience directing ops in Syria where they also used a heavy fires approach in conjunction with aggressive ground assaults. Unfortunately for them, they didn't seem to learn much about either, as they didn't focus urban warfare in training, didn't build urban warfare training facilities (at least not that I'm aware of), still emphasize bypassing as a rule, etc. 

In terms of the PLA, I'm not really sure what their capabilities and doctrine is, but if they think they're going to level the near ""mega cities"" in Taiwan that dwarf Kyiv without resorting to nuclear weapons, they too are making assumptions that will almost surely blow up in their faces should they try to use them.",c4e2834f2ef7ecbff9f960dfa3224dcfd086ac3b,True,False,,,,,0,1652405384,,0,{},i8e9vrq,False,t3_unsuhc,False,True,t1_i8a6dss,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/unsuhc/the_plas_evolving_outlook_on_urban_warfare/i8e9vrq/,1652405396,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652376584.0,

[],False,,Kvetch__22,,,[],,,,text,t2_wa50e,False,False,"I think you're thinking a few steps ahead. A few points to consider:

- There aren't credible reports that Russia has crossed the Donnets at all. In order to actually surround any forces they need to cut off the road from Bakhmut. I think they could, but the UA would fight them tooth and nail for it.

- Once they close off the road at Bakhmut, they need to *keep* it closed. Russia couldn't even stop resupply of Mauripol, 60km behind the front lines. Chances are the UA will be able to resupply Severodonetsk even if they get ""cut off."" 

- Russia took several weeks to capture Ribizhne, only now securing all of it. Chances are that Severodontsk, a city several times that size, will not fall particularly easy.

- Again, the Donnets is an important barrier here. The UA may choose to withdraw from Severodontsk as it's on the other side of the river. If Severodontsk falls but the Russians can't close the road from Bakhmut, the UA will just fall back to Lysychansk on the left bank and force the Russians to try and force the river, or advance from Popansa. 

- All of this is under the cloud of UA advances in the north. It's not guatenteed but something to watch. If the UA can start intersicting supplies between Vovchansk and Izium, Russian capacity will be degraded.

But the biggest ones:

- If Russia does end up taking Severdontsk, presumably after a few weeks of heavy fighting, I don't think that creates a huge problem for the UA. Even if the get the bigger victory and take Lysychansk and establish themselves on the left bank of the Siverkyi Donnets. Capturing all of Luhansk Oblast is not some kind of magic victory condition. The UA will not give up and will likely seek to counterattack and force a withdrawl the same way they have done before in the north. Russian forces would probably be able to advance eest but would run into a fortified line on the Sloviansk-Bakhmut-Horlivka axis, needing to continue the attack while already having drained however much conbat power getting to that point.

- Although a Russian tactical win is possible and perhaps likely, a Russian strategic win is dependent on being able to destroy a sizable portion of the UA force in Luhansk Oblast. And at the pace Russia is moving, that doesn't seem likely. It is possible the UA will withdraw or stand and fight hoping to fix Russian forces. It doesn't seem likely that massive UA formations will surrender without a fight.

- All of this is in light of the timetable Russian operations have followed. Three weeks to take Izium. Two and a half to take Rubizhne. Almost a month and still no progress in Slaviansk and Barkhovine. A month and a half to take most of Mauripol. Between UA maneuver defense and urban static defense, Russia is only capable of slow progress at a high price. And that is allowing the UA to dictate the terms of battle and array their forces in a way the preserves their ability to fight, even when they are outgunned. If Russia were able to complete sweeping three day operations to encircle UA forces ir would be a different story, but at this point they clearly can't. 

- Again this needs stressing: Russia is banking on their Donbas offensive forcing a favorable political settlement. That is clearly not happening. With Lend-Lease passed and the US and UK committed to Ukrainian victory, people need to be ready for this war to last several years. If/when Russia captures all the land they want, they will ask for peace talks and Zelenskyy will refuse to yield. The only way this war ends this year is if Russia chooses to end it on their own. In that sense, the Donbas campaign has already failed to acheive its goal of collapsing the Ukrianain armed forces and shaking Western confidence.",844972c09fe5f4d82ec7bee34e286f9c36d1664f,True,False,,,,,0,1652402085,,0,{},i8e2pl1,False,t3_unzexc,False,True,t1_i8dvafk,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/unzexc/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_12_2022/i8e2pl1/,1652402096,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652373285.0,

On the surface it looks like punishment is more pragmatic than deterrence. But why don't I say exactly what they don't want to say, they want to contain China without doing anything really. 

Deterrence requires them to actually continue to expand their power many folds, not just add some unreliable countries to a group that's not binding. Punishment? They can do that with just the power of a pen. 

If the US really wants to deter China. Get 20 Ford Carriers, 100 new Burke Destroyers, and at least add some more Nuclear Subs. China will be deterred then. 

Punishment doesn't work because Chinese leadership can prepare. China is basically giving a blank check at this point for most major industries, including chips. China will further insulate itself from major Western nations, and expand its relationship with developing countries. 

At the same time China will continue to add more tonnage than the US year after year in the seas. 

So I guess the question is, is America willing to go all in on containing China? Basically turn itself into a war economy to contain China. If it's just the current US navy, it's a powerful navy, but not unreachable by any stretch. Especially these days.

Executive Summary

What strategy should the United States use to deter China from using force against Taiwan? Some argue that deterrence requires convincing China that it would lose in a military contest, a strategy known as deterrence by denial. An alternative strategy, deterrence by punishment, attempts to convince China that even if it could win, the costs of trying would be so great that they would outweigh any possible gains. 

Policymakers should choose a strategy by analyzing its costs and risks, balanced against the extent of the U.S. interests at stake. This policy brief concludes that the costs and risks of deterrence by denial are not justified on the basis of U.S. interests. Although there are many compelling reasons to prefer that Taiwan remain democratic and retain its affinity with the West, these outcomes are not so vital as to merit a strategy for which the immediate consequence of failure is high-end war with a nuclear-armed adversary. 

A strategy of deterrence by punishment, by comparison, is pragmatic. It retains options for U.S. policymakers even if it fails — it neither produces immediate war, nor precludes a subsequent decision to go to war either to defend against or to expel an aggressor. So too is there reason for measured optimism that deterrence by punishment will work. The United States has real leverage, and an increasingly resolute set of partners, with which to convince China that aggression will be enormously costly. 

——————————

&gt; * Seeking to deter China from conquering Taiwan is the right policy. However, claims that it is best done through a strategy of denial are more a post-Cold War reflex than a product of careful analysis. 

&gt; * Investing in deterrence is like paying interest on a debt that might not actually be owed, and so the goal of the United States should be to keep that interest payment as low as possible. 

&gt; * Those arguing for a defense strategy designed to achieve deterrence by denial are of the view that the minimum investment and the maximum investment are the same — that deterrence effectiveness can only be achieved by convincing China that it would not win a war with the United States. 

&gt; * Whether this is wise or reckless depends upon whether such a maximalist approach returns more value than does the alternative of a strategy of deterrence by punishment. This alternative seeks to convince Beijing that even if it could win the war, the costs of doing so would outweigh the benefits. 

&gt; * Decades of theorizing about strategies of deterrence during the Cold War produced two general forms: deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment. 

&gt; * Deterrence by denial aims to shape an adversary’s choice by persuading the adversary that its prospects of achieving gains are vanishingly low, whereas deterrence by punishment aims to operate on anticipated costs. 

&gt; * First, when it fails, deterrence by denial immediately produces war — a military effort to prevent territorial aggression from succeeding. Deterrence by punishment, by contrast, does not endeavor to block the success of an initial use of force and even accepts that aggression might achieve its territorial objectives. 

&gt; * Second, deterrence by punishment’s focus on costs widens the aperture of available tools beyond the military. Cold War strategists early on recognized both military and nonmilitary measures for increasing the costs of an adversary’s actions, such as imposing “trade restrictions” and the loss of “moral standing and hence political standing,” among others.11 

&gt; * In short, the uncomfortable truth for policymakers is that there is no basis in fact by which to be convinced that Taiwan either is, or is not, the first step in an inevitable progression toward Chinese regional hegemony, or to know the consequences of that hegemony or the extent to which China’s invasion of Taiwan would do irreparable damage to U.S. alliances and the functioning of the global order. 

&gt; * Equally importantly, China’s behavior in Hong Kong has diminished the plausibility of any near-term reunification premised on Taiwan retaining its political, economic, and social structures. 

&gt; * This record of U.S. success in deterring territorial aggression likely reflects the potential aggressor’s anticipation of a combination of costs: the commitment of military assets and personnel, the loss of both in battle, and the ongoing price of subjugating the local population; the international political costs of violating an entrenched norm and, in some cases, explicit international accords; and its anticipation of the threatened military, economic, and diplomatic costs of reprisal. 

&gt; * …a 2019 poll showing that 61.6% of the Taiwan people surveyed would “resist” such an incursion.40 

&gt; * Taiwan’s own military capabilities, funded in 2020 at $11 billion to China’s $250 billion (and arguably limited for other reasons as well), are inadequate to deny China territory, but they are sufficient to make an attempt at taking the island by force and holding it quite costly.41 

&gt; * The argument in favor of pursuing deterrence by denial is especially problematic when considered in conjunction with the rich body of work developed to explain why wars happen, even when the military balance suggests that they shouldn’t. 

&gt; * When a deterrence strategy has high-end war with a nuclear-armed adversary as a direct and immediate outcome of failure, the burden is on its proponents to demonstrate both that vital interests are at stake and that there is no alternative approach with an equal or greater likelihood of success. The case made to justify a strategy of deterrence by denial over Taiwan is wanting on both counts. 

&gt; * A strategy of deterrence by punishment is pragmatic. The United States has real leverage with which to make threats that aggression will prove enormously costly for China. 

&gt; * A severe sanctions regime would, of course, come at a cost to the United States and to the global economy. Yet outright war would do the same, and then some, depleting U.S. military capability and exacting the unrecoverable cost of lost lives. 

&gt; * The United States cannot eliminate the risk that China might act on Taiwan. The decision is in China’s hands, and so all strategies of deterrence might fail. This means that the real work for policymakers is to select the strategy that accurately reflects not only how much cost the United States is willing to impose, but also how much cost it is willing to accept. 

&gt; * Although there are many compelling reasons to prefer that Taiwan remain democratic and retain its affinity with the West, these outcomes are not so vital as to merit the costs that the strategy of denial puts at risk: the loss of U.S. servicemember lives, and an increased probability of catastrophic nuclear war.

The comment that yours quoted above is in reply to one which contains a sourced and linked quote that can very much be paraphrased exactly as the GP did:

The source said that they are perhaps not quite as quiet as Seawolf or Virgina class subs - so the two quietest submarines in the most advanced navy in the world are quieter.
