&gt; Yeah, let me stop you there. Putin is going to be pulling all the artillery and began shelling indiscriminately if Ukraine is expelling Russia from eastern Ukraine territory it currently holds. There, that's one way around it.

It is really an open question whether Putin CAN do this or is ABLE to do this. ""Russian artillery"" is not a magic wand; it has not been able to inflict really significant military defeats on Ukraine so far. Russian artillery has been blasting Mariupol for weeks and somehow that city is still alive. Artillery alone is not enough to win a battle or a war.

&gt; If the Russian arm forces collapse, he would probably resort to extreme means. There you go, another way around it.

He might. Or it might not be politically feasible for him to. In which case that is a military defeat. If you play the game on the board, and you lose, and you decide not to up the ante and do something crazy and stupid to win a lost war...it's still a lost war.

These are a lot of assumptions. ""We would see"" is not necessarily the case, since the media landscape is by no means 100% complete and not every bit of this war is captured on camera. What we do know is that A.) Russia has abandoned most of its gains NW and NE of Kyiv, B.) they suffered at least some losses in the process, and C.) if they could have held these areas they would.

I respect @PhillipsPOBrien's work, &amp; I recommend his book How the War Was Won to everyone (seriously, go read it). I also think he makes some great points in this article. However, there are some key misconceptions that matter for improving military analysis. 1/
Unroll available on Thread Reader

His argument is that western military analysts overestimated Russian advantages vs. Ukrainian forces b/c they fixated on weapons and doctrine and ignored factors--like logistics, leadership, and morale--that really matter. In the 🧵 below, I'll explain why I partly disagree. 2/ 
I'm not a Russia analyst, but my Pentagon job and work @CNASdc translates the work of experts like @KofmanMichael, @MassDara, @SamBendett, &amp; @schlickw into policies, strategies, concepts, etc. If the US got Russia wrong, I'm partly to blame, so far as a nameless boffin can be. 3/ 
Generally, I think we got some things right, and some things wrong. Mostly, however, I think we've been gobsmacked by the fact that Russian operations look nothing like their doctrine or exercises. This is why O'Brien's analogy to the Battle of France is inapt. 4/ 
France's defeat in 1940 remains a topic of debate 80 years later. But most analysts attribute it to a bad plan driven by rigid, outdated doctrine and rigid, outdated leaders, and based on flawed assumptions German plans &amp; the character of mechanized warfare. 5/ 
For more on France's failure, Marc Bloch's Strange Defeat is a great starting point: amazon.com/dp/B09LF3JV8D/…
5/ 

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09LF3JV8D/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1
But Robert Doughty's ""Seeds of Disaster,"" is more pertinent, arguing that France lost because it rigidly followed its flawed Methodical Battle doctrine in what became a fluid, dynamic battle. amazon.com/Seeds-Disaster….
6/ 

https://www.amazon.com/Seeds-Disaster-Development-Doctrine-1919-1939/dp/0208020969
There are similarities w/Ukraine--flawed assumptions, bad plans, &amp; poor leadership. But there's a big difference: France failed because it followed bad doctrine. Russia's failing in part because it's not following its doctrine, or basic principles of war like unity of command. 7/ 
O'Brien argues that western analysts erred partly because they focused too much on doctrine, but how were these analysts to predict that the Russians would just throw doctrine and principles of warfare out the window? How else should they assess Russian forces? 8/ 
O'Brien says analysts need to look past that to assess the ability execute complex operations, support them logistically, and ensure that personnel are motivated and well led. I wholeheartedly agree that defense analysis needs to focus on these areas but... 9/ 
The Russian analysts I've worked with always cited these issues. I led a project years ago looking at Russian military weaknesses and how best to exploit them for deterrence and advantage in combat. 10/ 
I'll never forget @MassDara saying that Russia would struggle with C2 and logistics for any complex operation. These concerns were partly why @KofmanMichael found some Russia-NATO wargames unrealistic, as they posited massive invasions that Russia likely couldn't pull off. 11/ 
Most western analysis I've read, and my work @CNASdc, examines limited Russian incursions into NATO. The kind of operation that would minimize Russian weaknesses in C2, logistics, airpower, etc. We've spent relatively less time thinking about a massive invasion like Ukraine. 12/ 
But to the extent that we did, we thought it would be challenging for Russian logistics, C2, and airpower, but they'd follow their doctrine and execute plans that maximize their strengths like fires and numerical superiority. 13/ 
Instead, Russia's initial plan for Ukraine minimized its strengths and maximized its weaknesses by not following its doctrine. They didn't fight in BTGs, they didn't use fires to support maneuver, they didn't use precision strikes to suppress UKR airpower. It's bonkers. 14/ 
This is why the France 1940 analogy doesn't work. France failed because its plans followed bad doctrine and its leaders couldn't adapt. Russia's failing because it's not following its doctrine and its plans are insane and its leaders appear unable to adapt. 15/ 
So what lessons should analysts and those that use their work take away? 1) leadership matters, from the national level down to tactical units. Bad leaders tend to make bad plans and then can't adapt fast enough. They also tend to have poorly motivated subordinates. 16/ 
This is a sensitive topic though. Saying, ""the Russians have weak leadership and are unmotivated"" is a stone's throw from past racist attitudes that led analysts to underestimate opponents like Japan or Vietnam. It can also be a hard thing to assess. 17/ 
Still, I think analysts should examine operations and exercises to see, for example, if officers have to carry out or directly oversee basic tasks because they can't/won't trust subordinates. This distrust is crippling in combat. 18/ 
2) We need to think more holistically, both about adversaries and ourselves. We tend to focus on individual systems, rather than the whole apparatus needed to make them work. C2 and logistics matter as much or more than fighters, tanks, ships, and missiles. 19/ 
3) We need to analyze systems in realistic combat conditions. How a weapon/unit performs when it's dirty, disrupted, or degraded is way more relevant than its parade-ground appearance. 20/ 
4) We need to expand our mental models beyond a handful of scenarios. Most analysis is scenario-specific. This can help bound assumptions and ensure strategic relevance. But it also limits our thinking and our ability to adapt &amp; plan for the unexpected. 21/ 
5) We must be explicit about assumptions and examine them rigorously. About our adversaries. About ourselves. About allies and partners. About the character of warfare. Then we need to re-check them. We need to be open to people--even outsiders--who question our assumptions. 22/ 
6) US analysts must remember that war is hard. Decades of US operational and tactical success (strategy, not so much) have created unrealistic expectations about warfare. RUS-UKR is what happens when the capability gap isn't huge. 23/ 
Despite these lessons and clear overestimation of Russian performance, I prefer these mistakes to the alternative. Overestimation of a foe leads to misallocation of resources. Underestimation of a foe, as Russia is discovering, leads to catastrophe.",474927ef672e44627ad79b83b07db2345254f736,True,False,,,,,0,1648856816,,0,{},i31rc2w,True,t3_tt8iwh,False,True,t3_tt8iwh,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tt8iwh/how_the_west_got_russias_military_so_so_wrong/i31rc2w/,1648856831,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648828016.0

What I said was *As a nuclear power, you simply don't 'lose' wars in contemporary understanding.*

So what is a military defeat? 

&gt;If, as a hypothetical, the Ukrainians expel Russia from their territory, reclaim the lost Donbass, and Putin signs some sort of face-saving ""denazification"" peace, he has suffered a catastrophic military defeat. There is no way around it. 

Yeah, let me stop you there. Putin is going to be pulling all the artillery and began shelling indiscriminately if Ukraine is expelling Russia from eastern Ukraine territory it currently holds. There, that's one way around it. 

&gt;If his army collapses and there's no way to continue the offensive, he has suffered a military defeat. 

If the Russian arm forces collapse, he would probably resort to extreme means. There you go, another way around it. 

&gt;Even if he withdraws within the Feb. 23 borders and offers a ceasefire, he has suffered a military defeat.

Or he could resign. What's the point of saying shit that would never happen? Are we playing that game?

When Alvis comes back, there will be world peace. 

&gt;And these are all possibilities. Not all of them are equally plausible, but if someone here said a month ago that the Russians would be in disorganized retreat from Kyiv, no one would have believed them. 

Well, I don't believe there is a disorganized retreat. That would be a rout. We would see tons of fucking video blasting across all of the internet. We will see men throwing away their weapons and stealing cars to just gtfo. We will see the road jam with soldiers running for their lives. 

Are we? 

&gt;No, outright military defeat is a very real possibility for Putin at this stage. Even if it's politically unfeasible to call up conscripts/go full total war, even if Russia doesn't uncork that bottle, it is still a military defeat by any means.

***Key Takeaways***  
  
*We now assess that Russia has revised its campaign plan in Ukraine after the failure of operations to seize Kyiv and other major Ukrainian cities throughout March.*  
*The Kremlin’s claims that Russia’s main objective has been eastern Ukraine throughout the war are false and intended to obfuscate the failure of Russia’s initial campaign.*  
*Russia’s main effort is now concentrated on eastern Ukraine. Russian forces seek to capture the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.*  
*Russian forces will likely take Mariupol in the coming days but continue to suffer heavy casualties.*  
*Russian forces seek to fix in place the Ukrainian forces around Kharkiv.*  
*Russian forces captured Izyum after three weeks of fighting on April 1 and will attempt to advance southeast to link up with Russian forces in Luhansk Oblast in the coming days.*  
*Ukrainian forces recaptured large swathes of terrain both northwest and east of Kyiv in the past 24 hours, but Russia successfully withdrew elements of its damaged forces into Belarus.*  
*The Kremlin will continue to funnel reinforcements (including both low-quality individual replacements from Russia and damaged units redeployed from northeastern Ukraine) into operations in eastern Ukraine, but these degraded forces are unlikely to enable Russia to conduct successful large-scale offensive operations.*",81cdf4cc45843c38fbf0582b7c86f3b3b2772d77,True,False,,,,,0,1648855962,,0,{},i31pmb8,False,t3_ttokax,False,True,t3_ttokax,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ttokax/ukraine_megathread_april_1/i31pmb8/,1648855982,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648827162.0

But I doubt that the west would be so gratious to a Post-Putin Russia. I think that Russia as a whole would be a lot less hyper nationalistic if we offered them some kind of exit that does not involve 'split them up in weak client states' as a long term goal. 

If we want democratic change in Russia, we should make it very clear that we are against the Putin-Regime because he is no reliable partner, but not against the concept of a free, independet Russian Nation.",4e4bc77a1b134e6fbce0b0a1e2fa03aa1781ddcc,True,False,,,,,0,1648851738,,0,{},i31gsvj,False,t3_ttokax,False,True,t3_ttokax,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ttokax/ukraine_megathread_april_1/i31gsvj/,1648851755,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648822938.0

Almost all authoritarian regimes face political constraints and the ones that don't typically feature extreme cults of personality and a level of repression we do not see in modern Russia. 

Since you want to talk about Russian history, I think Russian and Soviet history will show you plenty of moments where either inter-elite politics or even public opinion have swayed the Kremlin and toppled leaders. 

You're correct that Putin has amassed far more power into his own position than we have ever seen in Russia previously (indeed, the USSR, save for during the Stalin years, was not a true single-person authoritarian regime). But no man rules alone, it is impossible. There are key players in every society and I see no evidence that  Russia differs in this regard. Where I think your analysis really falters is in the notion that Putin can somehow do whatever he pleases with zero repercussions. 

But your question: ""who is going to challenge Putin"" is an impossible one to answer. Authoritarian regimes always appear stable until they suddenly are not - this is *by design.* If we could point to an individual and say ""this is Putin's biggest threat within the Kremlin"" then that person would likely already be dead or imprisoned. 

Similarly, you can all but guarantee that if Russian standards of living collapse, tens of thousands return home wounded (or not at all), and Russia gets nothing out of it, then you would see domestic unrest that could be used to challenge the legitimacy of Putin's rule.

&gt;The soldier was part of a team that captured the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, 65 miles north of Kyiv, in the first days of the war.

&gt;They then occupied the 20-mile exclusion zone around the plant, where people are banned from living, dug trenches into radioactive mud and drove their trucks along dirt roads, kicking up radioactive dust.

&gt;Now ill and exhausted, they have retreated to Belarus.

&gt;""The Russian occupiers have left the Chernobyl nuclear power plant,"" said Ukraine's defence ministry. ""Two key reasons: losses caused by the Ukrainian army and radiation exposure.""

&gt;While the disaster of the nuclear power plant explosion at Chernobyl in 1986 is well documented in the West and was the subject of an award-winning BBC drama in 2019, it is relatively unknown in Russia.

&gt;It is unlikely that the Russian soldiers, mainly conscripts from the poorer fringes of Russia, would have known about the dark history of the abandoned power plant that they had been ordered to capture. 

&gt;They did not even know that they were going to war when they were told to invade Ukraine on February 24. Their officers had told them that they were still on a military exercise and they were not issued with any radiation protection suits.

&gt;After capturing the nuclear power station, the Russian soldiers were ordered to camp in the wood, known locally as the Red Forest because of the colour it turned after soaking up radiation from the nuclear explosion.

&gt;Russian commanders may not have known about the wood's reputation as a radiation hotbed, or may not have cared.

&gt;Either way, it points yet again to poor planning and poor leadership within the Russian army. Its reputation for competence and as an effective modern fighting force has been ripped apart over the past five weeks of war in Ukraine, in which thousands of conscripts have been killed.

Often times the military professionals can be given an easier time by critics as many of the mistakes and errors are placed on the political class. We see it in articles which assume that the military leaders have no say in decision making because the decisions made seem to have no military reasoning.

&gt; It has further been suggested that the shrinking of the Russian president’s inner circle to encompass a coterie of former intelligence officers devoid of military experience has contributed to groupthink. This could certainly be true, and would align with much of what we know about the military failings of personalist dictatorships. 

The article makes the case that this may be letting the Russian military leadership off too easily. It brings to mind the case of the Wehrmacht in post WWII thinking where the leaders were not responsible for poor performance or any wrongdoings. Likely due to the many books published after the war by the commanders themselves, that we know to be wrong and self serving today due to academic research.

&gt;But for the moment it is important to note that Putin may be as vulnerable to his critics among the hawkish nationalists as to those from more technocratic circles alarmed at the path now taken. It is the nationalists who have been energised by Putin’s aggression and will be most distressed should he fail. As cracks start to appear in the state-controlled media, challenging the view that the military campaign is going well and on schedule, those sounding the alarm warn of the consequences should the multitude of Russia’s enemies, from Americans to the ‘Nazis’ in Kyiv, triumph. They want to move beyond the limited operation that Putin claimed to have set in motion to something more absolutist. Ukraine must be defeated, and seen to be defeated, no matter what the costs. Perhaps because he is aware of this, Putin shows no sign of relenting on any of his core demands. He dare not confirm the weakness in his position.

It is a point of consensus among analysts that the initial phases of the Russian invasion of Ukraine have been a relative failure. Though Russia may still prevail in this conflict, the reasons for its blundering initial attempt are worth unpacking.

In certain regards, Russia’s failures reveal its limitations in fairly basic competencies such as logistical planning. The capability limitations of at least some Russian forces in areas such as tactical communications, as well as poor morale, certainly seem to have added to this mix. However, Russian forces have also suffered early losses due to a perplexing departure from their previous practices. The Russian army, which some have described as an artillery army with a lot of tanks, typically does not advance without substantial preparatory fires, which have been notably absent in the early stages of the conflict, along with any meaningful efforts at combined arms warfare. The use of Russian assets such as airborne forces and armour in penny-packeted formations which could not provide mutual support to each other has created substantial tactical vulnerabilities. A lack of preparation of the electromagnetic battlefield and the initially limited use of precision strike capabilities also stand out.

What might explain these curious choices? One answer put forward by analysts is that the unworkable political assumptions that undergirded President Vladimir Putin’s war plans – for example, that Ukraine would fall apart like an artificial state – were simply not challenged by subordinates who would not risk a dictator’s ire. It has further been suggested that the shrinking of the Russian president’s inner circle to encompass a coterie of former intelligence officers devoid of military experience has contributed to groupthink. This could certainly be true, and would align with much of what we know about the military failings of personalist dictatorships. *However, at this stage, we might consider an alternative explanation: that Russia’s failures reflect a series of long-standing erroneous assumptions about modern warfare that are held by wide segments of the military. If this is the case, senior members of the uniformed military may not have had to hold their tongues and subscribe to a war plan they did not believe in; rather, the war plan might be a reflection of what Russian officers have been writing and saying about modern war for years.*

In that sense, the US assistance has been very helpful.”

That probably doesn't really complicate their propaganda efforts too much. Either way, China probably expands it's influence over Russia.

For the US it's not great. Bleeding Russia further is a fairly low cost endeavor for the US at this point. It also allows the US to use soft power b/c it aligns E. Europe with the US's and W. Europe's interest. But there's less chance for surprise with deescalating.

For Ukraine it's a hard sell. They're doing well. They still have a lot of Russian forces on their territory that might not be there in a month. But they are suffering very real destruction in their cities.

[],False,,lawpoop,,,[],,,,text,t2_34w9i,False,False,"a few points:

 - The question was about the sovereignty of of Taiwan, not about China vs USA, the Chinese military vs. the Russian military, etc. 

 - Even if China were able to defeat the US in a head-to-head conflict, or get it to reneg on its security guarantees, that doesn't mean it could easily overrun Taiwan. It would still have to do an amphibious landing-- a military feat which is so difficult that the US military has declared it impossible-- for anyone, anywhere-- and they will never attempt it. The comparison you should make is the Chinese mil. versus the American mil., in regards to amphibious assault. 

- The US has seen the light in regards to supply chain issues, because of the pandemic, and is taking steps to correct it. See, for example, the recent $20billion+ investment in an Intel chip manufacturing plant in Ohio. Whatever improvements or 

- regarding beating the US, again, the question is about Taiwan's sovereignty. Even if China beats the US in a conventional war, they still have to do the impossible feat of an amphibious assault. 

Ultimately, China wants to rule Taiwan and create a ""re-unitified"" China; it doesn't want _necessarily_ to defeat it militarily, or annihilate the population, destroy the infrastructure. So China has an interest in the least bloody, least destructive conflict, to maintain the narrative that they are peacefully reuniting the country. 

Perhaps at some point China could make a threat so great against Taiwan, that Taiwan would prefer to capitulate, instead of incurring the horrible cost of the war, even if they could hold to a stalemate. Or the Taiwanese could stay firm and be willing to fight, like Ukraine. 

 - For some 20 years, people have been saying that the Russian military is a super-power, with cutting-edge, latest generation technology, and  a large volunteer force. That narrative fell about in about two weeks. 

We can't really say the state of China's military; for sure they are going to improve it over the next years and decades. It could be great, or bad, like Russia's, or somewhere in between. 

What we _do_ know is that the US military is the greatest that has ever existed, and has fought a war for _two decades_ in Afghanistan that did not destroy neither it nor the home country's finances. This military, the greatest the world has ever seen, has said that an amphibious assault is possible. Not just for the US, not just for the current state of the US military, but _everybody_. With modern weaponry and technology it's impossible to break through shore defenses. It just can't be done.",7580423e777f4745d059097490abb4db814f52d5,True,False,,,,,0,1648836570,,0,{},i30h72j,False,t3_ttokax,False,True,t1_i2zy0ck,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ttokax/ukraine_megathread_april_1/i30h72j/,1648836580,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648807770.0

It's doing great as a stop gap solution, but it's not categorically different. Future versions of the systems that have cross sat links could prove very useful to DoD as an alternative to current providers, where capacity is so low the price is painful even for the pentagon.

As far as long term implications, my view would be Starlink (and its future competitors) are unlikely to make the design tradeoffs necessary for these systems to be a replacement for tactical datalinks, particularly with jamming resistance, but also portability. Starlink itself will never shrink beyond a backpack scale deployable system.

[],False,,fdfdasdfasdfasdf,,,[],,,,text,t2_bxgdtz5,False,False,"&gt;I guess what I find puzzling is why India isn’t displaying at least symbolic opposition to Russia (perhaps while quietly continuing to trade with them). 

India is committed to neutrality on issues that don't deal with its neighbors. They abstained on the UN resolution condemning Russia's invasion, which many people incorrectly took to mean that they implicitly side with Russia. However, they also abstained on the resolution Russia submitted to the UN. 

Additionally, India does not have a permanent seat on the UN security council and can't veto Security Council decisions. By remaining neutral on issues involving Russia, Russia in exchange essentially acts as India's proxy veto on the UNSC on issues that relate to South Asia. France, UK, and the US are not willing to back India on issues relating to South Asia in the UNSC, hence India must maintain relations with Russia

&gt;Is there an angle here I’m missing? Does India just assume the West needs India against China, so that there won’t be long-term diplomatic harms associated with its stance?

India doesn't trust the west very much in general and views them as an unreliable partner. Some people will point to colonialism as a cause of this, but I'd argue that while that is a factor, it's not that significant compared to actions the West has taken after 1947. 

Post independence, US support for Pakistan, the Western reaction to India's war with Portugal, and most crucially when the US sent a carrier group to the Bay of Bengal to threaten India during the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War has seriously damaged the perception of the west as a reliable partner. In contrast, the Soviet Union and then Russia has consistently demonstrated themselves to be a reliable partner. Starting in 1971 when the Soviet Union sent a nuclear naval task force into the Bay of Bengal to dissuade the US from intervening against India and continuing to present day.

In more recent times, US sanctions on India over nuclear tests, bans on Indian politicians visiting the US, US withdrawal from Afghanistan, and Kashmir are all issues that have shaken India's confidence in the reliability of the US specifically.

&gt;Moreover, if I was India, I’d be looking to start moving increasingly away from Russian military hardware and towards Western alternatives, something which will made easier by maintaining the best possible relations with the West. 

This isn't really an option unless the US changes what they are willing to sell to India. The US specifically isn't that willing to do technology transfers, while Russia is willing to do that. Russia also provides India with nuclear submarines, the US isn't going to give India nuclear subs. Why would you switch from a country that is willing to give you the technology to build jets and tanks in your own country to one that will only sell you the completed product but with significant restrictions on when you can use it?",fe98acafc7e2f512e7630f5e2b7dbab51568c032,True,False,,,,,0,1648832234,,0,{},i3065oe,False,t3_ttokax,False,True,t1_i2zyj69,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ttokax/ukraine_megathread_april_1/i3065oe/,1648832250,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648803434.0

I realise that India had a long history of close relations with the Soviet Union and is the biggest single buyer of Russian arms, and that the West’s support for Pakistan during the Cold War still makes many Indians suspicious of their motives.

But China has now replaced the US as Pakistan’s closest ally, and Russia would be unlikely to actively support India in the event of a new Sino-Indian war (the best India could hope for would be neutrality). Moreover, the West has been working hard at building closer relations with India for a while, first with George W. Bush’s nuclear deal and more recently with the “Quad” arrangement. Finally, Russia’s piss-poor performance in this conflict raise questions about both its utility as an ally and the efficacy of some of its hardware.

I guess what I find puzzling is why India isn’t displaying at least *symbolic* opposition to Russia (perhaps while quietly continuing to trade with them). Several of Modi’s moves - such as meeting Lavrov today - seem as much performative as practical.

Russia has [2500-3000 tanks in active service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_main_battle_tanks_by_country#R), and lost maybe [400](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html)-[600](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1509833848615489537/photo/1) in 40 days of fighting.

How longer can Russia afford to continue this? Depending on numbers, if fighting continues at this intensity, Russian will lose their last tank somewhere between August and December 2022. In theory they have huge tank reserves of additional 10000, but how many of these are good even for spare parts is unclear.

Right now Russia's options are:

* keep trying to conquer Ukraine outright, at current pace, by end of the year they'll be fighting with Syrian mercenaries and [shitty technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/shittytechnicals/) - look like they've just given up on this idea, withdrawing from every losing front

The story of an elite Russian unit's war in Ukraine - BBC Newsnight

Russia’s 331st Guards Parachute Regiment is considered ""the best of the best"", but BBC Newsnight has been tracing the casualties as the unit battles through Ukraine.

The regiment's commanding officer - Col Sergei Sukharev - died in mid-March. His chief of staff and numerous other officers have also fallen.

The regiment previously served in the Balkans, Chechnya and the 2014 Russia invasion in the Donbas.

Tracking the unit through Ukraine, Newsnight’s diplomatic and defence editor Mark Urban looks at the outpouring of grief and anger from Russia in response to the devastating losses.

Would it have been better to have the F-22 as the top of the line air superiority fighter and have a much cheaper (probably non-stealth) replacement for the F-16 with the logic being that one of the cheaper aircraft is sufficient for most tasks and two or three combined are better than one top of the line aircraft.

[],False,,superbowlmovement,,,[],,,,text,t2_7bu5xndb,False,False,"If the Ukraine war drags out, does it help or hurt the following: Ukraine, Russia, China, and the U.S.?

I'm thinking a longer conflict helps Ukraine because seems to have the upper hand right now, and a ceasefire now will likely result in frozen lines like so many other recent examples (Georgia, Armenia, Moldova, Ukraine 2014) and result in a de facto loss of territory for Ukraine.  More importantly, this is a golden opportunity to damage the Russian army severely, which is one way to guarantee that Russia won't be back soon.  There is a real risk that a ceasefire gives Russia time to rebuild its army, train new recruits, and learn from mistakes such that Russia's military grows in effectiveness faster than Ukraine's.  

I think Russia wouldn't mind a ceasefire in order to recover per the description above. If the war ends today, they get a land bridge to Crimea as well as keeping Donbas and Crimea on their side.  It's unclear how the economy plays out, as sanctions may persist long after the war, and shut-in oil/gas damages the fields which leads to long-term economic harm. But in any case, the sooner the war ends the sooner people can focus on repairing the economy.

I think China is somewhat indifferent to how long the Ukraine war lasts. The longer it goes on, the more of a vassal state Russia becomes, giving discounted raw materials to China in exchange for black-market/sanctions-evading help under the table.  It also means more oil and gas pipelines get built to China, perhaps more railways, etc.  Yet, if things freeze right now, I don't think China really minds.  I think China's leaderhip believes time is on their side and that wars can take unpredictable turns, which can harm stability.

The U.S. I think is caught in a bind where they'd like to focus on the actual strategic threat (China), such as creating rival trade partnerships, not letting China get too aggressive with Taiwan or South China Sea claims, etc.  Yet the U.S. can't pivot to Asia so long as Putin keeps doing stuff like this, and nobody wants to hand Putin anything resembling a win, as that would embolden Russia, China, and every other bad actor to keep acting badly.  So I think the U.S. wants to get to a point where it's clearly a non-win for Putin with reason to believe that Putin really is deterred for the foreseeable future, before refocusing on China.

[],False,,hiakuryu,,,[],,,,text,t2_6pmwv,False,True,"&gt;Russia propaganda worked on western analysts. The ""modernization"" seems to be mostly just to build a reputation rather than to implement real capability.

&gt;Russia was probably largely unaware of their own problems. They have just been coming off of a few victories in Crimea and the War in Donbass (I'd argue not a victory, but was definitely spun in Russia as a victory). When there are so many lies, it's difficult for the military to understand the real story, and that has a huge detrimental effect on decision making skills of the entire chain of command.

I'd disagree here strongly.

It was known that the reforms that Defence Minister Anatoliy Serdyukov tried to implement were almost all rolled back by his replacement Shoigu when he came in, in 2012. I mean Serdyukov wasn't even the first to try and fight all the  problems that the Russian military had and that they knew that they had those problems.

There had previously been several reform attempts such as the 1997 plan under defence minister Igor Sergeyev and the 2003 programme of President Putin (‘Urgent Tasks for the Development of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation’), the latter of which was very similar to the 2008 programme, as it emphasized already the need for reductions in personnel strength, a gradual decrease in the use of conscripts in favour of professional soldiers, the creation of a professional NCO corps and drastic changes to officer training and education.

https://www.ponarseurasia.org/the-russian-military-under-sergei-shoigu-will-the-reform-continue/

&gt;Shoigu has maintained a relatively clean reputation throughout his previous tenures as minister for emergency situations and as the governor of the Moscow region. **He also appears to have the support of senior officers, most of whom despised his predecessor.** However, the military he has inherited is still facing a number of serious challenges.

&gt;**In the six months since his appointment, Shoigu has rolled back some aspects of the Serdyukov reforms, while keeping its core innovations intact for the moment.** Many of the changes have been primarily symbolic, in keeping with Shoigu’s goal of rebuilding trust between the Minister of Defense and senior officers by cancelling the decisions that were most upsetting to top generals. Actions such as the restoration of the Tamanskaia and Kantemirovskaia divisions (which had been transformed into brigades under Serdyukov) and Shoigu’s decision to wear a military uniform and epaulettes were calculated to please senior officers without undermining the changes enacted under Serdyukov.

https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/russian-military-reform-and-shoigus-poisoned-chalice/

&gt;Today’s Russia has still not developed a manufacturing base for the components necessary for complex armaments, which in Soviet times were produced at civilian factories specially licensed by the MOD (and where market forces naturally played no role). In the 90s these factories either closed or were converted to other types of production and, despite loud promises from its leaders, the military industrial sector is in no state to undertake the mass production of military technology, for the simple reason that the necessary components will still have to be partly hand-built at assembly plants. However much cash is injected into this sector, the production costs of the finished product will inevitably rise.   

https://www.ponarseurasia.org/is-shoigu-reversing-serdyukov-s-military-reform/

&gt;In the education sphere, Shoigu has restored the old training system that has top officers in school for a total of eight years during their careers instead of Serdiukov's Western-style system of one stint in a military academy followed by short courses to gain skills needed for specific positions. This is certainly a blow to modernization, and may well lead to an excessive number of graduates coming out of the military academies without positions available for them. This outcome could lead to pressure to increase the number of officers in active service, which would be a big blow to the reform effort.

&gt;The one critical area where bad things have already happened is in military procurement. I'm of the school of thought that believes that one of the main reasons that Serdiukov was removed is that his policies were threatening the income streams of key players in the defense industry. It is therefore not at all surprising that one of the Shoigu-led MOD's early acts was to essentially take imports of military technology from foreign sources off the table. As I've already written, this will ease pressure on domestic defense industry to improve quality of production while keeping prices from spiraling out of control. As a result, the procurement of a new generation of military equipment in the quantities needed for the military is likely to be imperiled.

That's quite a surprise since you also wrote: ""As I also stated, the premise of these actions is based on American military supremacy. Taiwanese leadership and Chinese leadership are both operating under the belief that a conflict over Taiwan will draw in the US.""  

&gt; A straight look through the realism school of great power competition. You responded by saying ""De-sinicization has been incredibly successful the last 20 years"" as if a diplomatic solution would be impossible without identification alignment. It's a negative claim, you would have to show why it is impossible, not I. But even then I try to entertain your claim by proposing 2 possible positions.  
  
A summary of my views:  
  
1. There is no diplomatic solution that can satisfy both China and Taiwan.  
2. Even if there is a diplomatic solution that satisfy both China and Taiwan, the US will not allow it.  
  
A bit expanded:  

1. You mentioned a Commonwealth and a Federation, just mentioning these terms do not offer a lot of insight on the actual solution. I get it, you're not paid for it, but then you also shouldn't be surprised that there isn't much to go on on terms alone. Terms aside, a diplomatic solution from China's perspective is 1 country. This is supported by the Anti-Succession Law of 2005. Furthermore, the *precondition* for even having high-level cross-straight talks is the 92 Consensus. The 92 Consensus is essentially saying there is 1 China but two governments. The DPP (and Taiwanese society at large) fundamentally rejects that, because they believe each side of the strait is a country. A diplomatic solution is impossible when both sides can't even agree to the preconditions for talks.  
  1. It's not just DPP, but Taiwanese society at large, that will not agree to the precondition (i.e., one country), because of de-sinicization.
  2. Now, you talk about the de-sinicization process and how it's not 100%. I agree. But I'll explain why it's a done deal. If you are more agreeable to ""more or less a done deal"" or ""as good as a done deal"" that's fine too, but effectively it's a done deal. Here goes. ~70% of Taiwanese identify as exclusively Taiwanese. ~20% identify as both Chinese and Taiwanese. ~2% identify as Chinese. The younger the person, the more likely they are to identify as Taiwanese. The older they are, the more likely they are to identify as Chinese and Taiwanese. Almost everyone &lt;35 years old identify as Taiwanese exclusively while the older generation is dying off. The trend is clear.
  3. From the above numbers and trend, it should be pretty clear that Taiwanese already developed their own identity and that it is effectively a done deal. There is no process from within Taiwan to reverse the trend.  
  4. There is not a single modern example where a de facto / jure country with it's own identity that decided it will be one country with another country. Therefore, Taiwan will not agree to being one country with China. Therefore, Taiwan rejects the precondition for cross-strait talks. Therefore, there will be no diplomatic solution.
  5. I hope 1.1-1.4 above make things a bit clearer.   
2. I mentioned this in another comment. We would sooner regime change Taiwan then allowing a diplomatic solution to happen.",be38b3362a1f732a5bdeddff1c1d3d62a7a64731,True,False,,,,,0,1648808844,,0,{},i2yshvy,False,t3_tr55rf,False,True,t1_i2wbh2i,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tr55rf/how_is_china_expanding_its_infrastructure_to/i2yshvy/,1648808859,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648780044.0

Yes, but it is assumed that several budget parts which appear in the US military budget either do not or only partially appear in the CN military budget (examples are healthcare/social support, construction, coast guard, R&amp;D, foreign operations / military aid etc) which would change figures a bit.

Barkhane began a month after Serval ended, and is a much longer commitment than serval was envisioned to be which is why so much foreign help was used. The American support of Serval was most importantly the use of 5 KC135 refueling tankers which allowed French Jets to launch 100 sorties in two months (quite an impressive operation by the Americans) however US Africa Command wasn’t integrated into the French forces during Serval while they would be integral to OP Barkhane. 

With Serval the US provided intel through drones most likely and also helped supplement French cargo planes in the air bridge from Chad to Bamako.

The Americans were clearly a huge help to keeping the operational tempo high (100 sorties in two months, holy shit). But the logistical feet that most armies and observers were most impressed with was how quickly French detachments were deployed. This was possible because how the French reformed themselves at a battalion level. Special forces were on the ground within 2 days of the operation being announced and the French indigenously airlifted a marine regiment and mobile artillery group from southern France within a week. Another French detachment was shipped into the west coast of Africa in the following week. This was all possible because the new battalion organization allowed for quick integration of rapid deployment units on stand by in southern France as well as French doctrine. See the French realized that a majority of their deployments would likely be in former colonies far from home in Africa and lacking the power projection ability of the American navy they had to create rapid deployment capabilities this is also why the French built the CESAR SPG because unlike heavier M109, Korean K9 and British AS90 (which have faster times for firing solutions) the CESAR is lighter and easier to airlift.

Article from BBC:

  
**The head of French military intelligence, Gen Eric Vidaud, is losing his job after failing to predict Russia's war in Ukraine, reports say.**  
Seven months after he took on the role, one report said he was blamed for ""inadequate briefings"" and a ""lack of mastery of subjects"".  
The US correctly assessed that Russia was planning a large-scale invasion, while France concluded it was unlikely.  
Gen Vidaud was blamed for that by France's military chief, a source said.  
However, the military source told AFP news agency that his job was to provide ""military intelligence on operations, not on premeditation"". As Gen Vidaud's service concluded that Russia had the means to invade Ukraine, the source said that ""what happened proves him right"".  
When contacted by the BBC, a military spokesman said French armed forces chief Gen Thierry Burkhard had no comment to make.

However, in early March Gen Burkhard acknowledged that French intelligence had not been up to the level of US or UK briefings, which were publicised to pile pressure on Russia's Vladimir Putin. ""The Americans said that the Russians were going to attack, they were right,"" he told Le Monde newspaper.  
  
""Our services thought instead that the cost of conquering Ukraine would have been monstrous and the Russians had other options"" to bring down the government of Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky, he added.  
  
**France's misreading of President Putin was all the more embarrassing because President Emmanuel Macron had spoken to him regularly in the days leading up to the invasion on 24 February.**  
  
Intelligence specialist Prof Alexandre Papaemmanuel told AFP it was too easy to blame military intelligence for the failure, which lay with France's entire intelligence community.  
  
But Gen Vidaud, France's former special forces commander, appears to have been squeezed out for other reasons too.  
  
Weeks after he took charge of military intelligence, his service came in for criticism when Australia scrapped a multi-billion dollar submarine contract with France in favour of a security pact with the US and UK. The Aukus pact came out of the blue in France and prompted a diplomatic spat.",16ffde345b7313cff107385f1cd3aae5035cd8f3,True,False,,,,,0,1648800839,,0,{},i2yixn9,False,t3_tsyhsy,False,True,t3_tsyhsy,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tsyhsy/ukraine_megathread_march_31/i2yixn9/,1648800852,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648772039.0

The hangup I have with pure realist view of the world is that, as u/Mezmorizor points out, it is a model of how humans behave in large aggregates, but it is not a complete model.  It ignores other things such as narratives/myths, which can cause people take collective actions, which sometimes overrides the demands of real politics.  

I'm not saying real politics is wholly invalid.  As a wise man said, 'all models are essentially wrong, but some are useful.'  Real politics is definitely useful, but it is not a perfect model.  Clearly, there are other forces at work in human behavior.

If you extrapolate Mearsheimer's view, it is the West's fault that people are dying by thousands in Mariupol.  But it's clear that Russian soldiers are the ones preventing the residents of the city and pulling triggers on the artillery.  Who among those invested into the myth of inalienable rights of all humans would abandon their belief and accept that the blame of this tragedy belongs to the West?

This all resulted in the military industrial complex and intricate economic an political systems, that kept this giant war machine going.

This writer of the telegram was clearly wrong.

Do you have any idea how absolutely, incomprehensibly stupidly insanely dishonest Russian ""concern"" for Ukrainian lives are? They are executing civilians on the streets and families in their cars and holocaust survivors in their apartments.

&gt;Eastern European countries choosing to join is only half of the picture. The other half is NATO choosing to expand. NATO is not a book club that accepts everyone. It's a deliberate decision of a military alliance to enlarge, that serves its interests. 

I have a question: Do -you- think that Sweden would be as likely to join NATO if Russia didn't violate their airspace monthly and practice nuclear attacks on Gotland? Do you think Finland would be less inclined to join NATO if Russia wasn't GPS scrambling flights on the border, threatened Finland and violated their airspace almost monthly? Do you think other countries perform constant cyberattacks on Sweden and Finland as well?

Russia has no friends because Russia is a shit neighbour. We wanted to be friends so bad- and now those appeasement politicians are hated by everyone and demanded to apologise for trying to remain cordial with Russia. Because once again Russia shows its sadistic nature.

The fact that nobody feels safe around Russia is because even the countries that they don't invade are constantly harrassed, threatened and reminded that Russia wouldn't mind dropping a nuke or two if they don't get their way.

Yeah I wonder why someone would want to defend themselves from that.

Actually that is not quite true, or to be more precise: it´s a bit more complex.

- Not every country puts the same categories for military spending into the military budget. 
- The purchase power is different. While for example the Chinese spending is much lower, they have to spend far less money for a comparable equipment. To make it short: the US spend far more money for an assault rifle than the Chinese for a similar one.

If you compare actual US/China numbers the result is that China comes very close to US spending when it comes to the actual purchasing power. If you compare spending numbers, you should compare countries with a similar wealth / economy system (like US/UK/Germany/France for example).

So we have four lines of defense. The first is the isthmus between the Kherson region and the Crimea, it should have been completely mined. And by the way, they told me that a week before the attack, some dick cleared it.

Next are the border guards, but the task of the border guards is not to engage in battle, but to see the fact of aggression, give a signal and retreat, move back, and so on. Then comes our irrigation system. Irrigation system - it was designed in the Soviet Union by the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Agriculture. The structure itself - as it were, the shape of the channel - does not provide for its crossing by any mode of transport. In any case, this is a complication of movement. That is, the logic is as follows: bridges explode, they all stop, and our artillery simply destroys them, otherwise.

Then the third line of defense is the Dnieper River itself. The Dnieper, the Antonovsky bridge, is held to the last, if anything, it explodes, and Kherson, as it were, is out of hostilities altogether, there is no bridge, we only guard the water line. Whoever crosses it, that Dnieper.

And the last line of defense is the Kakhovka bridgehead. New Kakhovka is being evacuated, people are being evicted there, and the Kakhovka bridgehead is being held. Redoubts and caponiers are made there. All this takes a day. These days we had to stop them at the entrance. Did not work out.

The current governor, Gennady Laguta, according to his colleagues, on the first day of the war put the keys on the mayor's table with the words: ""I'm not participating in this,"" and left the region. Together with him, on the first day of the war, the leadership of the police, the prosecutor's office, and the courts left, and a little later, the SBU officers were evacuated.

NATO is not a book club that accepts everyone. It's a deliberate decision of a military alliance to enlarge, that serves its interests.   

Countries are not equal, and the US is the least equal of them all, as the sole reigning superpower. America used it vast soft power to boost the pro-NATO forces in the country, nudged it in that direction by promising NATO membership in 2008, throwing its diplomatic weight behind the 2014 revolution, and spreading its influence in Ukraine ever since, knowing it could end badly for Ukraine. [This telegram was written by William Burns in early 2008, a then ambassador to Russia, current head of the CIA.](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08MOSCOW265_a.html#efmBTnBfi)     

&gt;Ukraine and Georgia's NATO aspirations not only touch 
&gt; a raw nerve in Russia, they engender serious concerns about 
&gt; the consequences for stability in the region.  Not only does 
&gt; Russia perceive encirclement, and efforts to undermine 
&gt; Russia's influence in the region, but it also fears 
&gt; unpredictable and uncontrolled consequences which would 
&gt; seriously affect Russian security interests.  Experts tell us 
&gt; that Russia is particularly worried that the strong divisions 
&gt; in Ukraine over NATO membership, with much of the 
&gt; ethnic-Russian community against membership, could lead to a 
&gt; major split, involving violence or at worst, civil war.  In 
&gt; that eventuality, Russia would have to decide whether to 
&gt; intervene; a decision Russia does not want to have to face.   


&gt; Dmitriy Trenin, Deputy Director of the Carnegie 
&gt; Moscow Center, expressed concern that Ukraine was, in the 
&gt; long-term, the most potentially destabilizing factor in 
&gt; U.S.-Russian relations, given the level of emotion and 
&gt; neuralgia triggered by its quest for NATO membership.  The 
&gt; letter requesting MAP consideration had come as a ""bad 
&gt; surprise"" to Russian officials, who calculated that Ukraine's 
&gt; NATO aspirations were safely on the backburner.  With its 
&gt; public letter, the issue had been ""sharpened.""  Because 
&gt; membership remained divisive in Ukrainian domestic politics, 
&gt; it created an opening for Russian intervention.  Trenin 
&gt; expressed concern that elements within the Russian 
&gt; establishment would be encouraged to meddle, stimulating U.S. 
&gt; overt encouragement of opposing political forces, and leaving 
&gt; the U.S. and Russia in a classic confrontational posture. 
&gt; The irony, Trenin professed, was that Ukraine's membership 
&gt; would defang NATO, but neither the Russian public nor elite 
&gt; opinion was ready for that argument.  Ukraine's gradual shift 
&gt; towards the West was one thing, its preemptive status as a de 
&gt; jure U.S. military ally another.  Trenin cautioned strongly 
&gt; against letting an internal Ukrainian fight for power, where 
&gt; MAP was merely a lever in domestic politics,  further 
&gt; complicate U.S.-Russian relations now.",9e017d04edaa542d7c7f2094a5f2ca7bb6315748,True,False,,,,,0,1648774328,,0,{},i2x9i8k,False,t3_ttcbnd,False,True,t1_i2x08rb,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ttcbnd/john_mearsheimer_on_why_the_west_is_principally/i2x9i8k/,1648774339,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648745528.0

In so far as Poles or Latvians or South Koreans are not being attacked by their neighbors nor funneling more of their national wealth into preparing to be attacked by their neighbors they are able to make themselves richer, more prosperous and more productive economic partners. And the world is safer in so far as fewer powers are guaranteeing their security through nuclear weapons. As the world's biggest economy who cannot be truly threatened by the relative growth of most countries simply being so much larger and richer than all but a few of the rest, the US benefits the most and most clearly from this positive global business climate fostered by US military security. 

This is balanced by the perceived fundamental credibility of American alliance - Will Americans be willing to die for these places?

[],False,,bleepblopbloopy,,,[],,,,text,t2_4lu6l,False,True,"THE WAR in Ukraine is the most dangerous international conflict since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. Understanding its root causes is essential if we are to prevent it from getting worse and, instead, to find a way to bring it to a close.

There is no question that Vladimir Putin started the war and is responsible for how it is being waged. But why he did so is another matter. The mainstream view in the West is that he is an irrational, out-of-touch aggressor bent on creating a greater Russia in the mould of the former Soviet Union. Thus, he alone bears full responsibility for the Ukraine crisis.

But that story is wrong. The West, and especially America, is principally responsible for the crisis which began in February 2014. It has now turned into a war that not only threatens to destroy Ukraine, but also has the potential to escalate into a nuclear war between Russia and NATO.

The trouble over Ukraine actually started at NATO’s Bucharest summit in April 2008, when George W. Bush’s administration pushed the alliance to announce that Ukraine and Georgia “will become members”. Russian leaders responded immediately with outrage, characterising this decision as an existential threat to Russia and vowing to thwart it. According to a respected Russian journalist, Mr Putin “flew into a rage” and warned that “if Ukraine joins NATO, it will do so without Crimea and the eastern regions. It will simply fall apart.” America ignored Moscow’s red line, however, and pushed forward to make Ukraine a Western bulwark on Russia’s border. That strategy included two other elements: bringing Ukraine closer to the eu and making it a pro-American democracy.

These efforts eventually sparked hostilities in February 2014, after an uprising (which was supported by America) caused Ukraine’s pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, to flee the country. In response, Russia took Crimea from Ukraine and helped fuel a civil war that broke out in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.

The next major confrontation came in December 2021 and led directly to the current war. The main cause was that Ukraine was becoming a de facto member of NATO. The process started in December 2017, when the Trump administration decided to sell Kyiv “defensive weapons”. What counts as “defensive” is hardly clear-cut, however, and these weapons certainly looked offensive to Moscow and its allies in the Donbas region. Other NATO countries got in on the act, shipping weapons to Ukraine, training its armed forces and allowing it to participate in joint air and naval exercises. In July 2021, Ukraine and America co-hosted a major naval exercise in the Black Sea region involving navies from 32 countries. Operation Sea Breeze almost provoked Russia to fire at a British naval destroyer that deliberately entered what Russia considers its territorial waters.

The links between Ukraine and America continued growing under the Biden administration. This commitment is reflected throughout an important document—the “us-Ukraine Charter on Strategic Partnership”—that was signed in November by Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, and Dmytro Kuleba, his Ukrainian counterpart. The aim was to “underscore … a commitment to Ukraine’s implementation of the deep and comprehensive reforms necessary for full integration into European and Euro-Atlantic institutions.” The document explicitly builds on “the commitments made to strengthen the Ukraine-u.s. strategic partnership by Presidents Zelensky and Biden,” and also emphasises that the two countries will be guided by the “2008 Bucharest Summit Declaration.”

Unsurprisingly, Moscow found this evolving situation intolerable and began mobilising its army on Ukraine’s border last spring to signal its resolve to Washington. But it had no effect, as the Biden administration continued to move closer to Ukraine. This led Russia to precipitate a full-blown diplomatic stand-off in December. As Sergey Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, put it: “We reached our boiling point.” Russia demanded a written guarantee that Ukraine would never become a part of NATO and that the alliance remove the military assets it had deployed in eastern Europe since 1997. The subsequent negotiations failed, as Mr Blinken made clear: “There is no change. There will be no change.” A month later Mr Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine to eliminate the threat he saw from NATO.

This interpretation of events is at odds with the prevailing mantra in the West, which portrays NATO expansion as irrelevant to the Ukraine crisis, blaming instead Mr Putin’s expansionist goals. According to a recent NATO document sent to Russian leaders, “NATO is a defensive Alliance and poses no threat to Russia.” The available evidence contradicts these claims. For starters, the issue at hand is not what Western leaders say NATO’s purpose or intentions are; it is how Moscow sees NATO’s actions.

Mr Putin surely knows that the costs of conquering and occupying large amounts of territory in eastern Europe would be prohibitive for Russia. As he once put it, “Whoever does not miss the Soviet Union has no heart. Whoever wants it back has no brain.” His beliefs about the tight bonds between Russia and Ukraine notwithstanding, trying to take back all of Ukraine would be like trying to swallow a porcupine. Furthermore, Russian policymakers—including Mr Putin—have said hardly anything about conquering new territory to recreate the Soviet Union or build a greater Russia. Rather, since the 2008 Bucharest summit Russian leaders have repeatedly said that they view Ukraine joining NATO as an existential threat that must be prevented. As Mr Lavrov noted in January, “the key to everything is the guarantee that NATO will not expand eastward.”

Tellingly, Western leaders rarely described Russia as a military threat to Europe before 2014. As America’s former ambassador to Moscow Michael McFaul notes, Mr Putin’s seizure of Crimea was not planned for long; it was an impulsive move in response to the coup that overthrew Ukraine’s pro-Russian leader. In fact, until then, NATO expansion was aimed at turning all of Europe into a giant zone of peace, not containing a dangerous Russia. Once the crisis started, however, American and European policymakers could not admit they had provoked it by trying to integrate Ukraine into the West. They declared the real source of the problem was Russia’s revanchism and its desire to dominate if not conquer Ukraine.

My story about the conflict’s causes should not be controversial, given that many prominent American foreign-policy experts have warned against NATO expansion since the late 1990s. America’s secretary of defence at the time of the Bucharest summit, Robert Gates, recognised that “trying to bring Georgia and Ukraine into NATO was truly overreaching”. Indeed, at that summit, both the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, were opposed to moving forward on NATO membership for Ukraine because they feared it would infuriate Russia.

The upshot of my interpretation is that we are in an extremely dangerous situation, and Western policy is exacerbating these risks. For Russia’s leaders, what happens in Ukraine has little to do with their imperial ambitions being thwarted; it is about dealing with what they regard as a direct threat to Russia’s future. Mr Putin may have misjudged Russia’s military capabilities, the effectiveness of the Ukrainian resistance and the scope and speed of the Western response, but one should never underestimate how ruthless great powers can be when they believe they are in dire straits. America and its allies, however, are doubling down, hoping to inflict a humiliating defeat on Mr Putin and to maybe even trigger his removal. They are increasing aid to Ukraine while using economic sanctions to inflict massive punishment on Russia, a step that Putin now sees as “akin to a declaration of war”.

America and its allies may be able to prevent a Russian victory in Ukraine, but the country will be gravely damaged, if not dismembered. Moreover, there is a serious threat of escalation beyond Ukraine, not to mention the danger of nuclear war. If the West not only thwarts Moscow on Ukraine’s battlefields, but also does serious, lasting damage to Russia’s economy, it is in effect pushing a great power to the brink. Mr Putin might then turn to nuclear weapons.

At this point it is impossible to know the terms on which this conflict will be settled. But, if we do not understand its deep cause, we will be unable to end it before Ukraine is wrecked and NATO ends up in a war with Russia.

Commoner officers - previously uncommon - now completely unheard of.

No, the West is not 'principally responsible'. Russia is. Mearsheimer isn't able to make a case for the converse.
