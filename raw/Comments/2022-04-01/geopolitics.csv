As to India siding with the US on Ukraine, it can happen but so far Biden administration seems to be looking for a free lunch. Career US diplomats have a more nuanced take regarding India. 

What will it take for India to support US?

1. Carte blanche US veto in security council against India's interested for 50+ years. 

2. US troops on the ground should there be a war with China or proxy supported by China or Russia for the next 10-15 years.

No there isn't. Europe is more of a geographic expression rather than an organic socio-cultural construct. And while there are vehicles like the EU which have somewhat intermingled the economies of various nations together, it has a lot of problems that make people rightly skeptical of some sort of unification.

&gt; It's not too different from the early United States.

No it is completely different. The United States was ruled collectively as Thirteen Colonies by the British Empire for almost 200 years. They had a common cultural heritage being descended from British colonial settlers. 

The Colonies then rebelled against UK in a common national war of independence and formed together to create a country.

Meanwhile nations like France, Spain, and Portugal already had their own national identities consolidated well before the US was even a thing. Portugal for example was one of the earliest proto nation-states considering how it won and tried to maintain its independence from the Kingdom of Castile and later Spain. 

Poland had been occupied and partitioned by three separate powers and it took until the end of the Cold War for them to be free. Nations like Poland which highly values its own national sovereignty would be in favor of something like the EU turning into a united super-state.

China is rich on three fronts, resources thag includes labour and military, finances, and strong nationalism.
The third front is quite arguable since despite the anti democratic pressure events, we have yet to see domestic protests against authority of Xi. Either it is controlled through oppressive measures and media or people really are OK with the authoritative conduct.

Regards the nukes and codes. Mistake of great proportion it would be to think that new nations may not have both or either. FSB, KGB and high political ranks may as well put a puppet in all or some of those new formed states.

Another point where we differ is, in regards to west becoming ever more powerful.

That's not really true. Please hear me out just a second. The notion of the nation state was first built on culture, not ethnic stratification. Then it was built on stability (Kings, Pharaohs and the like.)

But it is Gustav Adolphus who creates the modern professional government (bureaucracy) in order to maintain the logistics necessary to defend the nation. That leads to maintaining an infrastructure to help the people rather than line the royal pockets.

So classic liberalism (free speech, freedom of movement and religion) requires an adherence to codified law (rule of law not man) and an apparatus to maintain those rights (like due process, bail and other classically liberal measures).

Without the nation state, there is simply no way to maintain a liberal government.

""Liberalism’s most important selling point remains the pragmatic one that has existed for centuries: its ability to manage diversity in pluralistic societies. Yet there is a limit to the kinds of diversity that liberal societies can handle. If enough people reject liberal principles themselves and seek to restrict the fundamental rights of others, or if citizens resort to violence to get their way, then liberalism alone cannot maintain political order. And if diverse societies move away from liberal principles and try to base their national identities on race, ethnicity, religion, or some other, different substantive vision of the good life, they invite a return to potentially bloody conflict. A world full of such countries will invariably be more fractious, more tumultuous, and more violent.  
That is why it is all the more important for liberals not to give up on the idea of the nation. They should recognize that in truth, nothing makes the universalism of liberalism incompatible with a world of nation-states. National identity is malleable, and it can be shaped to reflect liberal aspirations and to instill a sense of community and purpose among a broad public.  
For proof of the abiding importance of national identity, look no further than the trouble Russia has run into in attacking Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that Ukraine did not have an identity separate from that of Russia and that the country would collapse immediately once his invasion began. Instead, Ukraine has resisted Russia tenaciously precisely because its citizens are loyal to the idea of an independent, liberal democratic Ukraine and do not want to live in a corrupt dictatorship imposed from without. With their bravery, they have made clear that citizens are willing to die for liberal ideals, but only when those ideals are embedded in a country they can call their own.""",e49b229141427dddc447d7d75db1933123e6d048,True,False,,,,,0,1648818615,,0,{},i2z97f6,True,t3_ttqahr,False,True,t3_ttqahr,/r/geopolitics/comments/ttqahr/francis_fukuyama_liberalism_needs_the_nation/i2z97f6/,1648818637,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648789815.0
