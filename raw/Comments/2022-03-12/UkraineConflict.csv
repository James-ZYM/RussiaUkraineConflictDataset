That's a fair question. And in reality, some of them wouldn't get launched. But during the Cold War the presumption was that there would be mere minutes to respond to an attack, so nuclear sites on both sides should be able to get near-instanteous warning and authorization. 

We actually had a close call in the 1980s where a defective Soviet early warning system detected multiple launches from North America. :|

&gt; BANGKOK - Thousands of Russian tourists are stranded in Thailand&amp;#039;s beach resorts because of the war in Ukraine, many unable to pay their bills or return home because of sanctions and canceled flights.

&gt; There are about 6,500 Russian tourists stuck in Phuket, Surat Thani, Krabi and Pattaya, four provinces that are popular seaside resort destinations, in addition to 1,000 Ukrainians, Yuthasak Supasorn, governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand, told The Associated Press on Friday.

&gt; While almost all direct flights from Russia have been suspended, connections are still available through major carriers based in the Middle East.He said efforts are also being made to find alternative methods of payments for Russian tourists.

Shame on their friends
Shame on their teachers
Shame on their doctors

Shame on their politicians
Shame on their military officers 
Shame on their Foreign Secretary Lavrov

Shame on all the Russian people - you political complacency has enabled yet another barbaric leader to be your chosen leader who has systematically lied and deceived you and the World for his own gratification - and committed horrific crimes in your names.
Shame on every Russian wherever they may be
How can any Russian feel pride in being a Russian, singing its national anthem, watching its flag fly, hear and speak its language, read its literature, listen to its music culture…. Such things bring feelings of disgust!
Shame on Russian people everywhere!

Russians! for fucks sake wake up and be better, 
Demand what is good
Demand democracy
Demand freedom is speech 
Demand freedom of assembly 
Demand freedom
Demand Accountability
Demand political transparency
Demand Rule of Law

Start by 
Recognising Russia has invaded Ukraine
Denouncing all those who took you into this War
Demand transparency of all that has happened 
Demand the harshest of punishment for Putin and all of his team and commanders involved in attacking and invading Ukraine
Apologise for what was done in your name
Own the misery and damage and loss, killings, maiming, looting, destruction and damage done in your names
Make reparations - genuine ones. Instead of military service send Russian volunteers to repair the damage, to make peace, to be a remedy, a force for good and a force for change


But don’t just shoot Putin…. You’ll never change Russian that way. If you do take that option, I can guarantee, the same will happen in a few years and your children will ask you why you did nothing. If this happens your legacy as a Russian is perpetuating wanton brutality for your future generations.

Finding Russia on here is like finding Waldo. If you lose patience, Russia represents 1.65T of the 94T economy. The countries against it about 70T of the world economy.   


In 1989, the official GDP of the Soviet Union was $2,500 billion while the GDP of the United States was $4,862 billion with per capita income figures as $8,700 and $19,800 respectively. Russia is not the USSR. Russia is not a great power. No one wants the fucking RUBLE as a world currency. That's beyond stupid. 

  
I listened to Kim's analysis. I found it particularly lacking. I do agree that she is right that Russia's fight here is about a unipolar vs multipolar world. The fact that she just found that out doesn't mean that the US and EU haven't known that since Dugin published The Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia in 1998 and it was made a part of every officer's training in the Russian military.

You don't think the West noticed?

  
Sanctions mean a fucking ton when your country is about to default, when you have to cut people off from the internet to avoid people hearing the other side, and when your military is bogged down in a warzone failing hard as Russians who don't care about geopolitics die. 

  
The wests play is to choke off the Russian economy, send the country into default, destroy them politically, and force a regime change from within. They'll do this while keeping NATO unified, and making sure that Putin doesn't win in Ukraine.  
Putin threatened the world with nukes if they interfere. Said the sanctions were essentially a declaration of war (and he's right). Yet has he attacked NATO militarily?
