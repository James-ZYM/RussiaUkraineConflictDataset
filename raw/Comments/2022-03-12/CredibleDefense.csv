For instance, we mostly see Russian vehicles getting knocked out by infantry weapons but also Ukranian armor getting knocked out by Russian ones. And while Ukraine is able to dent Russia aerial supremacy the air defences that Russia has means Ukraine also can't really use CAS, and a lot of Ukranian planes and drones are getting shot down.

What this means is that Ukraine can very effectively deny a fast victory, but doesn't have a ton of answers to Russia resorting to a slower war, which is how the Russian army tends to fight doctrinally (Michael Kofman, probably my favourite analyst on this war, referred to them as a primarily fire based army). Ukraine has fine infantry and infantry weapons but you can't launch large operational offensive based on infantry without armor and CAS, so even if the Russians slow down they will not have an easy time retaking their land.

Maybe they're saving their air asset and armor for a massive operational counterattack for when the Russian army is weakest, but I fear that the Ukranian are not doing as well as English speaking media would have us believe, and the best they can hope for is economic pressure forcing Putin to the table, since direct NATO intervention is also probably off the table.",aec0680058587f04580170e0871151d3e872b2ab,True,False,,,,,0,1647125482,,0,{},i0fbjcl,False,t3_tbthvo,False,True,t1_i0d4iel,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tbthvo/russian_military_less_capable_than_the_press/i0fbjcl/,1647125496,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647096682.0

Russia is using conscripted, poorly trained and poorly motivated soldiers. By all means, there are some really well trained, well motivated and tough units, but a lot of the soldiers are in the former category.

Many of the Russian soldiers have friends and family across the border in Ukraine. And many are quite capable of recognising at least some of the propaganda.

The soldiers didn't get any pre-warning they were going to war, according to some accounts they only knew after crossing the border or when getting live ammunition.

I don't know if Ukrainian young conscripts have a lot better training, but they have a major advantage when it comes to a conscript army: They are fighting on home ground. They are defending their homes against an invader, and that tends to harden the resistance.

Ukraine has also had the benefit of a lot of training from US and allied instructors, as well as some equipment. The best Ukrainian units are likely those responsible for stiffening up the resistance. With a highly motivated conscript army, sprinkled with some high end NCO's and officers you can get good results.

Iraqi soldiers didn't seem to want to fight for Saddam. They probably recognised the US was more interested in clobbering their (not so popular) leadership, and surrendered quickly. With the exception of some units, there simply wasn't a will to fight. Large swathes of Iraq was perfect for the armoured units of the US and allied armies. US equipment and training far surpassed their Iraqi counterparts. Iraqi armour was simply no match for the Abrams tanks or ATGMs of other vehicles.

But that was just the initial battle, which the US and allies aced through. The next steps were a farce, from the disbandment of the Iraqi armed forces and banning almost all civil servants from office, combined with a complete lack of cultural knowledge and the ridiculous idea that the Iraqi people would see the US as liberators. In the end, the US bitterly learned (or were reminded) that occupation against an unwilling populace is a far more difficult task. The Russians are facing a similar proposition, with too few troops to occupy Ukraine and pacify an angry population.",56c6614c7fc82f551d6d7a8906568167343af0b9,True,False,,,,,0,1647114432,,0,{},i0en2wa,False,t3_tc8vmj,False,True,t3_tc8vmj,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tc8vmj/what_is_the_difference_in_strategy_of_the_2022/i0en2wa/,1647114450,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647085632.0

If we are operating under the assumption that there only ~190k Russians in country, how many of those men are going to be involved in an assault on Kyiv?

Which is defended by the UA and is (im safely assuming) awash in ATGMs. 

I keep using the 2016 Battle of Mosul as an example of a successful urban assault, and that took over 100k soldiers, American equipment and logistics, complete and nearly unobstructed air superiority with precision guided air strikes, a population largely sympathetic to the invading force, and complete control of the surrounding countryside. All against a poorly armed and trained 12k man force of ISIS.

Even if the Russians were an American peer force that weren't running into self inflicted logistical failures, they simply don't have enough boots on the ground to seriously challenge Kyiv.

&gt; Just to give an example of the type of brutality that the Russians brought to Syria, the United Nations shared a list of hospitals and clinics in Idlib Province with the Syrian government and the Russians basically in the hopes of getting the Russians to avoid accidentally hitting these places. And, instead, the Russians used this list to target these hospitals. So it was part of the Russian strategy—to attack hospitals. And that was, I think, partly to break the morale of not just the rebel movement but the population.

Military experts have in the past warned of the risk of accidents or miscalculations by the nuclear-armed neighbours, which have fought three wars and engaged in numerous smaller armed clashes, usually over the disputed territory of Kashmir.

Tensions have eased in recent months, and the incident, which may have been the first of its kind, immediately raised questions about safety mechanisms.

""On 9 March 2022, in the course of a routine maintenance, a technical malfunction led to the accidental firing of a missile,"" the Indian Ministry of Defence said in a three-paragraph statement.

""It is learnt that the missile landed in an area of Pakistan. While the incident is deeply regrettable, it is also a matter of relief that there has been no loss of life due to the accident.""

The ministry said the government had ""taken a serious view and ordered a high-level Court of Enquiry"".

Pakistani officials said the missile was unarmed and had crashed near the country's eastern city of Mian Channu, about 500 km (310 miles) from capital Islamabad.

Pakistan's foreign office summoned India's charge d'affaires in Islamabad to lodge a protest over what it called an unprovoked violation of its airspace, saying the incident could have endangered passenger flights and civilian lives.

Pakistan warned India ""to be mindful of the unpleasant consequences of such negligence and take effective measures to avoid the recurrence of such violations in future"".

'MATURE HANDLING'

One senior Pakistani security official told Reuters, on the condition of anonymity, that the incident had raised alarm and could have escalated into a ""critical untoward situation"".

""The admission that it was a missile was very nonchalant,"" he said. ""What does this say about their safety mechanisms and the technical prowess of very dangerous weapons? The international community needs to have a very close look at this.""

The official said it was possibly a BrahMos missile – a nuclear-capable, land-attack cruise missile jointly developed by Russia and India.

According to the U.S.-based Arms Control Association, the missile's range is between 300 km (186 miles) and 500 km (310 miles), making it capable of hitting Islamabad from a northern Indian launch pad.

The Pakistani official wondered if the incident meant that India had ""missiles in ready-to-launch positions and pointed at Pakistan, and that too without any safeguard of a command and control system"".

A Pakistani military spokesman told a news conference on Thursday evening that a ""high-speed flying object"" originating from the northern Indian city of Sirsa had crashed in eastern Pakistan.

""The flight path of this object endangered many national and international passenger flights both in Indian and Pakistani airspace as well as human life and property on ground,"" he said.

A Pakistan air force official said the object, flying at 40,000 feet and three times the speed of sound, had flown 124 km (77 miles) in Pakistani airspace.

Happymon Jacob, a professor of international studies at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, said both sides had handled the situation well.

""It gives me great hope that the 2 nuclear weapon states dealt with the missile incident in a mature manner,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""New Delhi should offer to pay compensation for the Pak house that was destroyed.""",3d05015be72294a80914fd943af9c89c9466c67b,True,False,,,,,0,1647107921,,0,{},i0e7hzj,True,t3_tcmy8e,False,True,t3_tcmy8e,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tcmy8e/india_accidentally_fires_missile_at_pakistan/i0e7hzj/,1647107932,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647079121.0

Energy retention is important - period. On the offense, having high energy aids in giving your own BVR missiles the best possible launch window and initial energy. On the defense, it means potentially being able to just overpower enemy missiles. 

Generally when we speak of super maneuverability, we're speaking of post-stall  control. In general we're talking about flying the aircraft in such a way that it's presenting a very large cross section into the incoming air. Being super maneuverability requires to have the tools available to retain enough control authority to not just completely close control, and have enough thrust to keep you from falling out of the sky. You need good energy retention to be ""super maneuverability"" - but using super maneuverability uses up your energy. I don't think it'd generally be considered to be reliable defensive maneuver. For example in your F-14 example... if you do any ""super maneuverable"" thing, you're going to be in sitting like a duck at 200kn scenario.

Directly answering your question ""do modern airforces take this type of situation into account?"". I think the answer is yes. I don't think they've ever stopped really taking this situation into account, particularly because high-energy retention correlates very well if your aircraft having all sorts of useful traits (clean air-frame, high thrust to weight ratio, good acceleration and climb rates).",d4750983ef391579b6780c2cafd7d3fdb94be8df,True,False,,,,,0,1647102805,,0,{},i0du1nj,False,t3_tcdumy,False,True,t3_tcdumy,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tcdumy/why_energy_retention_and_hyper_maneuverability/i0du1nj/,1647102826,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647074005.0

Sorry, but the way you phrased that is wrong. Missiles can pull high g, but have very high wing-loading and thus will lose more energy in a turn than bigger-winged fighters.  In other words, a faster aircraft or missile must make many more g's in order to match the turn rate of a slower aircraft. Fighters count on having a maneuverability advantage since the missile is so much faster; since it's faster the missile will have to pull more g's in order to turn with the fighter, and that loses missile energy faster. 

Maneuverability certainly does help with avoiding SAMs - the common tactic is to see it approaching and stay in that position well past the pucker point and then at the very last split second - turn hard. A missile must pull many times the fighter's seven-g turn in order to stay with the fighter. Of course, seeing the missile coming is imperative, and a missile's big smoke trail helps a lot with that.

Yeah, if you're going 200 knots and a missile is coming you're going to have a difficult afternoon unless you're so low the missile radar loses you in the ground clutter.

The things that slowed their opening attack can be fixed with time. Like logistics, or tactics, or communication.

However, RUS has 3 gigantic problems on their hands in the upcoming months/years:

1) **Low Morale** \- The invasion started with soldiers who were not motivated to fight, and this will get worse as more 'western' news makes it to the RUS population and military losses mount.

2) **Quality of Soldier** \- It is a fact now, RUS is using conscripts and SYR mercenaries. The quality of these soldiers is clearly subpar. We have all seen the videos at this point of RUS forces parking 20 tanks in one spot, only to be destroyed by UA drones and ATGM. Meanwhile, reports are that elite units like VDV and Chechens have been wiped out, leaving less specialized troops at RUS disposal. With casualty numbers quickly mounting (est between 3000-9000 troops killed) RUS faces a huge problem when it comes to deployment of new combat ready troops. If they haven't been able to properly train these guys pre invasion, there isn't much chance they will do it now in my opinion. Additionally the influx of new, low quality, non-cohesive units will only feed the issue of low morale.

3) **Money** \- Yes they had 600 bil reserves but it immediately got cut by 50% when RUS lost access to foreign accounts. RUS forces are bleeding vehicles. 1 helicopter for them costs about 15 million dollars. A jet costs 36. All economists I follow have agreed RUS will run out of funds by June. In order to continue to raise money, RUS must find willing trade partners which right now means China. China is not a friend of Russia. In fact, they are taking advantage of them by waiting for Russia to discount their oil before buying. They also are helping to lower the Rubel vs the Yuan for their advantage. Visa/Mastercard/Amex pulling out of Russia also means they have had to rely on China's UnionPay to keep the bank cards working.

Those 3 issues all feed into one another like a positive feedback loop. Low money means low pay for troops, means less morale, means less quality soldier.

(Apols for the megalink)#

&gt;Russia warns that Moscow now considers arms shipments to Ukraine as 'legitimate targets' for military  
&gt;  
&gt;A senior Russian diplomat has warned that from now on Moscow will consider arms shipments to Ukraine as “legitimate targets”.  
&gt;  
&gt;The comments by the deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov, reported by Sky News and BuzzFeed News, are likely to raise fears over a potential escalation in the conflict in Ukraine.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ryabkov said that Russia had made its position clear to the US.  
&gt;  
&gt;He said that Russia “warned the US that pumping weapons from a number of countries it orchestrates isn’t just a dangerous move, it’s an action that makes those convoys legitimate targets”.  
&gt;  
&gt;Denouncing US sanctions against Moscow, he said they were an “unprecedented attempt to deal a serious blow to various sectors of the Russian economy”.  
&gt;  
&gt;But he insisted that Russia did not intend to expel western media and businesses, adding: “We aren’t going to escalate the situation.”

Depends. Inside Ukraine you would have thought that was already happening.

Outside its going to really come close to triggering Article 5.

Perhaps they are after those flights from Turkey?

If they are going to hit ground targets they are going to need precision guided missiles, probable SEAD (suppression of air defenses) on a scale not yet seen (calling Justin Bronk!) and good intelligence.

Your mileage may vary.

Time is on Ukraine's side. Ukraine has a huge amount of reserves it can continue to mobile and deploy into blocking positions to free up its more experienced troops for counter-attacks.

You are self-selling, real hard.

Putin is KGB.  In the Soviet era, they made lists of people who were compromised by their greed so that they could exploit/control them.  Because they knew, in the 1980s, when Putin was a young officer and people still played The Great Game seriously, how powerful the military equestrian class were and how much the Central Committee in particular feared them.

Putin will have brought that understanding of what we would call the mil-industrial-security state forward with him.  As indeed, part of what brought him to power was the disgust of the Russian people for the blatantness of the 90's 'everything for sale' Yeltsin era and it's /Ravno/ criminal elite who thought themselves so far above the law that they didn't even bother to hide the trappings of their ill-gotten wealth outside the public eye.

As Russia starved.  

Putin has been fighting that battle, with the authoritarian power of an undisputed autocrat, ever since.

When the army moves single battalions from a brigade of 3 and you only have 480 trucks for what should be a 1,000 truck CS/CSS transport schedule, it's okay.  Because you are only 'advisors' to a Separatist movement and your 8th Combined Arms Army is little more than a shell.  Anf you are only going to have to explain why you aren't ready to stand up the Total Force if there is a real war.  

Yet these single deployments have, in the West, been common-knowledge \_and believed to be a consequence of Russian budgetary limitations\_, since 2016 at least.

And Putin would know what we believed.  Because we don't try to hide it (Dr. Karber on 'The New Generation Warfare' Hybrid mode system of battle, on You Tube...).

Are we to believe that the MGB, which monitors everything, does not know, not only what the Russian Army does to support an ongoing insurgency.  But also what we know of that Army's maneuver constraints as applied to the Ukraining 'Great Raid' of 2014?

Similarly, if you are a Russian general and you see the blood and the field hospitals and the MiGs and the Helicopters.  You know it's not fake, because these are billions of dollars per day commitments that Russia cannot sustain as a permanent bluff.

Which means it's \_going to happen\_ because a pull back now is a permanent bully-coward embarrassment to Russia and, if it fails, you will die when the offensive stalls out.

Because the people who /get to spend that kind of money/ on a  developed war reserve stockpile of essential POL and MRE and Tents, know what and where they are short.

And Putin knows them, likely by the names of their kids, as the holders of the checkbook on that wartime holding.  For they are his Siloviki, his circle of confidants in the military and securitat and both sides know: if you screw up, by Ponyatiya rules of 'never embarass or hurt your own team', the price is a fall from grace that ends in the grave. 

Because friends are enemies then and this is why Putin wants you close so he can put his thumb in your wife/son/daughter's throat when things go wrong.  You will die first, to save them.

If you admit the problem beforehand, you live, maybe exiled from the group or otherwise shamed/demoted but you live.  Because the plan can be modified, thrustlines consolidated, number of lead columns as screening elements reduced.

Trading risk of unfavorable force ratio casualties for enroute, close in, security elements to keep the confidence of CS/CSS deliveries high in bringing the necessary logistics foward to keep things moving.  Speed is what controls LER here.

If you do it after, they feed you to the dogs which they use to test the mettle of the Spetz, naked man vs. hungry puppy.  Because you are Sovok.  Literally a 'Soviet'.  A relic of the old ways best dustpanned from history.

Generals can be replaced.  We did it all the time in WWII ETO.  Stalin did it in 1939, on the eve of war.  Your honor is your status, not the other way around.  This is a constant mistake of the 'Eastern Promises' interpretation of an organized caudillo politick.

\_There are rules\_.

Now, Troops and Tanks are another ten years from replacement, even if Putin can find the money, in China, to pay for new ones while Russians bemoan sanctions AND a major operational defeat.

And he is in his 70s.  He will not likely live to see it, even if someone doesn't put some strychnine in his coffee.

Beyond which, his 'honor' lies in not wanting to leave his country 'Bespredel' or lawless/without principles because he knows that the West will roll Russia like a greedy prostitute with a knife if he doesn't reestablish some kind of distance between the angry/frightened/fools in Washington and their special kind of Corruption and the old ways which have always kept Russians safe behind a wall of their own 'the world hates us' insular paranoia.

Putin doesn't want Russia to become a Tusovka, a 'safe space' for the flavor of the month insanity we call the radical left to poison as they have Europe and America.

With all of this as a given, whatever is actually going on in Ukraine, I think it is far more akin to what happened in Iran when the Iraqi columns, for no reason at all, suddenly stopped advancing for two weeks, yanking defeat from the jaws of victory.

The logistics issues are just a cover for whatever mechanism is in play (how does HPM damage to ignitions sound?) and the reason I believe this is because the simple countermeasures used to fend off the partisan forces have not been implemented.  Kyiv should have fallen within the first week.  Those airborne units should not have been hung out to dry at Hostomel.  And Russia still commands the internal rail lines with which to shift supply units and replacement forces from the East back around North.  Probably within a day or two. 

\_Here\_ is where I could reasonably believe that long term corruption eroded the base of Russian competencies.  Because these soldiers are fighting very poorly, even by Russian standards, and that simply should not be for a nation which has run 'training exercises' for every unit across the country, over the last 8+ years in the Donbass.

A mystery.  But that the big-money deployment and war reserve POL/Ammo pallet loads are being conserved while home-station training is sacrificed.  Because I can all but guarantee those are on separate funding lines.

[],False,,sanderudam,,,[],,,,text,t2_6iure,False,False,"Russian invasion force is simply not enough to subjugate Ukraine and mobilizing the entire Russian military might is unlikely due to 

a) lack of combat ready equipment lying around 

b) long time to organize and train new recruits into a capable fighting force (months)

c) need to maintain army on other fronts at least some nominal force

d) Russian population knows of a limited special military operation, not a ""full scale let us mobilize the entire nation"" war. Selling that mobilization to the public is a tall task.

e) Russia has trouble supplying their current invasion force, throwing in additional armies is going to strain the logistics even further

Looking at the war and how it has progressed, I see it mostly going to how Ukraine has planned to fight the war and very little to how Russia planned to fight the war.

1) It is obvious that Russia will have the initial initiative and Ukraine needs to trade land for time. Time to mobilize troops, to train them, to supply them.

2) By trading land, Ukraine knows that Russian troops will exceed their supply lines and become vulnerable to ambushes, as well as tactical counter-attacks.

3) Ukraine needs to wither down Russian forces, until they lose so much equipment, men and supplies, that Russia becomes incapable of advancing further.

4) Ukraine needs to hold onto towns and cities so as to make it difficult for Russia to guard their rear. This has been successful except for Kherson and Melitupol. 

5) Russia intended to knock out Ukrainian air force and command and control. They have failed at that.

6) Russia intended to quickly capture towns and cities by just driving a recon/forward element into it. It has failed for any major settlements (Kherson took a week of fighting and Melitupol around 2 days).

7) Russia moved into secondary strategy of surrounding and capturing key Ukrainian cities. Kyiv is not surrounded and will not be surrounded (my confident opinion). Neither will Kharkiv be surrounded. Mariupol has been surrounded, but that was the easiest and pretty obvious to everyone, including Ukrainians that it would happen.

Looking at how the fight is going, except for holding onto Kherson and Melitupol longer and not evacuating civilians from Mariupol earlier, things have been going according to Ukrainian strategy. Meanwhile Russia has only partially achieved their goals (surrounding Mariupol, but still not being able to take that and seizing Kherson and crossing Dnepr, but it also took longer than they hoped and allowed Ukraine to fortify Mykolayiv).

I expect these things to happen in the coming week:

I Russia will attempt to surround and attack Kyiv, but will not succeed and will suffer heavy losses.

II Russia will attempt to surround and seize Sumy, which they will surround (rather tighten the noose, but will be unable to take.

III Russia will attempt to pocket the Donbass Group of Ukrainian army, but will not manage to, at least not in a tight manner.

IV Russia will attempt to bypass and surround Mykolayiv and advance towards Kryivyi Rih. Neither will achieve strategic success (although I think Mykolayiv will be cut off from direct link to Odessa, but this Russian blockage will not be sufficient to either take Mykolayiv nor enough to advance towards Odessa).

V The Russian advance comes to a complete halt, Russian casualties will pass 20% of their initial force and there will not be enough offensive capable units left to advance.

VI Ukraine will continue and enlarge their counter-offensives. Most promising axis are:

VII Counter-attacks to the West and North-West of Kyiv, pushing them out of Kyivan suburbs and into the swamp.

VIII Counter-attacks to the East of Kyiv by forces in Russian rear (around Nizhyn).

IX Counter-attacks against the forward elements north of Mykolayiv and towards Kryviy Rih.

X Tactical counter-attacks in Izjum and Donetsk to allow for a partial retreat from the Donbass area.

XI I think Ukraine will probe in all of these directions, but I think they would focus on one of them (probably North-West of Kyiv, but potentially Mykolayiv/Kryvyi RIh area due to the extremely vulnearble nature of Russian troops there).",70d2e23774ddd3735baec8dbf2d04913a97e7dd3,True,False,,,,,0,1647085257,,0,{},i0cxq0z,False,t3_tbthvo,False,True,t3_tbthvo,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tbthvo/russian_military_less_capable_than_the_press/i0cxq0z/,1647085268,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647056457.0

[],False,,OneCatch,,,[],,,,text,t2_11e3n3,False,False,"Too early to say. I would say that I don't think the battleship analogy works. Battleships went out of vogue because a new weapon system (aircraft) came along and rendered the whole mode of combat they were designed for (massed visual range combat) irrelevant.  

The current situation with MANPADs isn't quite the same - it's a continuation of the arms race between attack power and defense capability that you always see - whether that's in smallarms, battleship armour, ECM, etc. For all we know there's some seismic improvement in composite armour currently being tested in DARPA or wherever. Maybe a new gen of ERA will render current AT weapons irrelevant. Most realistically, the promulgation of APS might shift the balance again.  


For tanks to become irrelevant, two things would need to happen. Firstly, they'd need to be rendered definitively incapable of continuing to adapt in the face of counters. And second, other platforms which replaced (or rendered irrelevant) their current role would have to exist. For battleships, there was no cost effective counter to air attack, and carrier air wings could do everything a battleship could do, and better.  

One scenario which is somewhat plausible is if APS proves effective, there's an argument that lighter armoured units might be able to shrug off smallarms with their armour, and shrug off heavier projectiles with APS. That would mean they could do the job of tanks for cheaper, alongside having better fuel economy and speed and so on. On the other hand, it might be that APS proves effective against missiles and other relatively slow HEAT type projectiles, but that newer and even faster sabots can get through it - in which case tanks are around to stay because they be big enough to mount such guns. Or it might be that APS can only be dealt with by saturation or ECM, in which case fuck knows what might develop as a result!  

We might have had a [Force Z moment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_Z) here in Ukraine - i.e. a demonstration that careless employment can be punished very harshly by a new generation of counters. In the case of Force Z, it did presage an end to that type of platform because, even after lessons were learned from it, battleships were still vulnerable and inefficient. But that's not necessarily true for tanks.

Their ""caring"" is not the point. 

&gt;Ukraine cannot defend itself vs. Russia

Its still in the fight. That fight is over when the Ukrainian people say so. 

&gt;what’s the point of membership if non-NATO members get defense guarantees?

The point of NATO is collective security. It exists for those democratic states in the North Atlantic area who wish to form an alliance to protect each other, so they are treaty bound to defend each other but in return they standardize equipment, doctrine and training so they can rapidly integrate their forces. This allows the huge economies of North America and Europe to deter aggression against them. This shuts down the ability of hostile states to isolate members and pressure them with varying degrees of aggression as happened in the late 30s. 

Democratic states in the region are wide open to not joining if they wish as I listed above. Its a collection of free societies who balance their diplomatic independence with the security needs of themselves and the wider region. 

&gt;None of this is to say Ukraine shouldn’t have the right to make these choices. It is to say in reality they can’t make certain choices given their constraints.

A full scale invasion of 200 000 mechanised troops is not a ""constraint"" its a violation of international law and norms recognized by almost every state on Earth and has been the foundational stone of post WW2 politics. It is the bedrock of international stability. That most did not see this as likely is the main reason it could happen. 

People get themselves lost down rabbit holes of ""Russia's wants"".  

Days before the invasion Ukrainian government officials were saying a full invasion was not likely. This is not a legitimate escalation of a conflict, nor one many forseen. It was mostly the OSINT community who really rung the alarms loudly until the final weeks. So it is not credible to say Ukraine should have to bow to such an extreme provocation.

Russia has no fast option at this point, as they don't have the strength to quickly capture Kyiv.

As for Russia's slow options:

1. Destroy cities.  This isn't cheap.  In Syria Assad dropped cheap barrel bombs via helo. Not feasible in Ukraine with so much anti-air.  Cruise  missiles and bombs are expensive; so are helos and planes and fuel and maintenance for them; and Ukraine's air defenses are still active in some areas.  So U.S. intelligence has found that Russia's air force isn't doing much in Ukraine these days.  Instead, Russia is destroying cities the cheaper way: via artillery.  However if Ukraine can use its own artillery and drones to slow that down, or attack resupply convoys (including artillery shells), it could take a looooong time for Russia to destroy cities with artillery.
2. Russia could also try to starve defenders out, but that takes time too.

So that's where we are right now: Russia slowly leveling cities and starving them out if they can surround them.

&gt;  
&gt;Armor should be in an over watch position to provide its no1 job, direct fire support to infantry and as a anti armor component.

You can break modern warfare into two units. Infantry does the taking and holding of ground. Artillery does the killing of infantry, everything else supports those two functions. Generally armor is behind the front line of infantry giving it close fire support. While the indirect fire from artillery in a well organized support gives your ATGM teams someone to think about while your meat bags approach. They will also have APCs or IFVs nearer to them knocking out autocannot fire assisting the infantry  and revealing the placement of anti armor elements earlier. 

This is an idealised battlefield and with a NATO formation you would expect a lot of help from fixed wing and rotor craft. 

We have seen a lot of very poor employment by Russia. Anti air equipment taken by drones while undeployed. Tanks hit by artillery when bunched up in narrow streets of a town. Vehicles abandoned for seeming no reason. 

In a modern attack you want to be throwing as many different problems at your opponent as possible. You want to overwhelm their ability to think through a problem and throw out the wrong solutions at the wrong time. You want his life to be hell and for him to focus on the wrong component at the critical moment and your infantry to be able to start dislodging their entrenched positions. The tank is part of the problems you are throwing at them. Its not the front row so its think b, c, or x they are thinking about until its used then they have to shift that up to a and the other things you have in motion get deprioritised. It allows you to hit strongly entrenched positions giving you problems or even their own tanks trying to hit your APCs. Perhaps even a counter assault by their armor and other units to wreck hell into your assault.

hmmmm

&gt;Tanks are always vulnerable. This is why you employ ""combined arms"" interlocking support of differing weapon systems to a modern battle field. Infantry should be out ahead of the armor suppressing anti armor forces, supported by artillery's with air power and other elements also involved. Armor should be in an over watch position to provide its no1 job, direct fire support to infantry and as a anti armor component.

Tanks on their own are vulnerable. Always have been. 

&gt; Unlike earlier generation systems like TOW, javelins are fire and forget and have considerably less setup.

Ease of set up and fire and forget like 105mm recoilless. Its not some crazy new game changer, its evolutionary. 

&gt; but I don't think they've ever been this vulnerable at all ranges and at all times before.

You might want to look up Desert Storm and what Apaches and Warthogs did. 

Anyone who thinks WWII tanks ""dominated"" the battlefield seem to have not read up on Kursk or Caen. 

&gt;""You don't, you want an IFV with an ATGM launcher""

Javelins cost something like $180k a pop. More over IFV are full of troops, if tanks have no place then they have no place times 10.

To me, Ukraine is losing because Russia is on its territory, continuing to take ground, has the balance of forces and is inflicting damage on its infrastructure.

Ukraine may be offering up a fearsome and competent defense but they haven’t been able to push back the Russians, hit back at supporting Russian infrastructure (meaningfully) or create a disaster for Russia that forces a withdrawal.

Let’s say Russia isn’t able to take Kyiv or Kharkiv but is able to keep both cities in a state of constant danger and at risk of artillery strike. Is that a win for Ukraine?

I think there needs to be a deescalation path because Russia will likely be able to survive the economic damage the West has levied (albeit horrific for the Russian people), and Ukraine cannot survive as anything more than an anarchic hellscape without some sort of deal.

There's two main factors that lead me to believe this isn't a problem.

First, the more widely you distribute effective and lethal ATGMs among the infantry, the more armored units have to consider this and work with dismounted infantry to ensure they're properly screened and ATGM operators can be suppressed. The more armor relies on dismounted infantry to successfully carry out basic maneuvers, the less effective it is at doing armor things. While an armored unit is advancing in tandem with dismounted infantry, it can't move faster than a walk - which means that enemy light infantry can, in theory, fall back at a similar pace. The slower you advance, the less opportunity you have to engage rear echelon units.

(And you'll say ""but falling back is dangerous, they'll give up prepared positions, infantry on the retreat is very vulnerable"", to which I say ""yes, tanks will be great tool for advancing infantry to exploit such opportunities at a tactical level, but that doesn't make them more maneuverable than motorized infantry at an operational level"".) 

Second, the economics come down squarely on the ATGM side. An M1 Abrams costs something like $10 million to acquire, and is expensive to operate and maintain. A Javelin command unit costs about $250k and each shot costs about $100k, and that's the Lexus of ATGMs; an AT4 costs way less (and is way less effective). For the cost to acquire and maintain 2 MBTs you could equip an entire infantry company in the ATGM-centric fashion I'm thinking, where every squad's firepower is centered around employing and supporting an ATGM. Contrast a modern US infantry squad, focused around two light machine guns and a light grenade launcher.

The cost of another MBT lets you train and equip rear echelon units with ATGMs as well. If you can equip each truck column with a Javelin and 4 shots - and remember, in the new army, ""everyone is a Javelineer"" - then even if the adversary achieves a breakthrough, they'll have to advance cautiously against support elements too. 

If the adversary risks disaster whenever they drive a vehicle into contested territory without a dismounted infantry escort, then you've completely neutralized their ability to conduct maneuver warfare.",f8ffab9e72cf9ccce8029bed6c725e2b1121dd8f,True,False,,,,,0,1647061642,,0,{},i0c3ey5,False,t3_tbkt8t,False,True,t1_i0bzm4w,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tbkt8t/are_mbts_going_the_way_of_battleships/i0c3ey5/,1647061659,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647032842.0

[],False,,Xyzzyzzyzzy,,,[],,,,text,t2_6qgej2g0,False,True,"I don't think tanks are going into total obsolescence like battleships, but their role is going to be seriously reduced.

Compact, widely distributed, relatively cheap, long range, easily employed, **highly accurate and highly lethal** infantry anti-tank weapons place some pretty tight limits on how tanks can operate. Historically, tanks would prefer to operate alongside dismounted infantry, but it wasn't *necessary* - you can find any number of battles in WW2 where tanks alone won the day.

That has really been the theory behind armored forces since WW2. If you have an armored brigade, you have a unit that can drive forward, easily brushing aside any light defenses or screening forces, until it either meets a similarly armed enemy unit or captures all of its objectives.

Tank enthusiasts talking about combined arms kind of prove the point. Armor is useful precisely because it doesn't *need* infantry support. In a large set-piece battle, sure, but the point of the large set-piece battle is to penetrate a defensive line so your armor can go run wild in the enemy's rear areas. If the Cold War had gone hot, then 8th Guards Army's plan was to employ combined arms forces to break the first line of resistance, then rush armor and mechanized infantry through to quickly secure objectives and cut off NATO formations, against light resistance. (The Soviet doctrine was [deep battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_operation), but the broad strokes of armored/mechanized operations were the same across all armies.)

It's clear that if tanks must *always* work in coordination with dismounted infantry when engaging *any* resistance, that means that your shiny armored brigade can't move faster than dismounted infantry unless there's literally no resistance. There is a huge difference between ""light resistance"" and ""no resistance"". The theory of armor is that light resistance may as well be no resistance, but that is no longer true. And if your tanks have to advance cautiously and in coordination with dismounted infantry when any enemy infantry element, however small, could be present, then what's the point of spending all that money on a tank?

But that's no longer possible. Think of the Ukrainian army - the Twitter video version, at least - as the new model for infantry. In the Navy, everyone is a fireman. In the Marines, everybody is a rifleman. On the 2020s battlefield, everyone is a Javelineer - or, at least, everyone is there to support the Javelineer. If you have 8 people in a squad and each one carries 1 ATGM round, **and that round is presumably lethal**, that means that with some preparation your one squad of infantry could theoretically render an entire armored company combat-ineffective. 

And we haven't even started talking about the dramatically different battlefields of the 21st century. We think of Kyiv as a moderately sized capital, a city but not a *big* city - in global rank it's somewhere between the 100th and 150th largest city. In 1940 Kyiv would have been the 8th largest city in the world. The environment has dramatically changed - cities are *much* larger than they were the last time we had large-scale peer warfare. And cities are *much* more important strategic targets, because they represent a *much* larger share of economic activity. These trends will only accelerate as developing countries develop. Urban warfare presents tactical problems for armor, as an ATGM could be lurking behind any building, as well as *physical* problems - there are many urban streets where a tank cannot fully rotate its gun.

---


I think a good historical example of how tanks might be used in modern war are WW2 German assault guns - the venerable StuG III in particular. These were armored vehicles that existed to support and enable infantry, and did a damn good job of it. As important as any technical feature of the vehicle were the crews. StuGs were considered artillery, and as such were manned by crews who had been trained in direct-fire artillery doctrine, which was all about how to best employ the weapon to support infantry, as opposed to tank doctrine which more heavily emphasized maneuver and exploitation.",b791eb1849c36908cbd089b0a3d0471029cc9969,True,False,,,,,0,1647058129,,0,{},i0bxc79,False,t3_tbkt8t,False,True,t3_tbkt8t,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tbkt8t/are_mbts_going_the_way_of_battleships/i0bxc79/,1647058141,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647029329.0

[],False,,Xyzzyzzyzzy,,,[],,,,text,t2_6qgej2g0,False,False,"Questions like this one seem pretty obvious to those of us who live in countries where corruption among ""normal"" people is uncommon - bureaucrats, civil servants, police, customs, tax collectors and field grade officers. (""Normal"" people as opposed to political and business elites.)

After all, if Maj. Smith is overseeing the motor pool at Fort Bragg, and he sells half his incoming fuel supply to the biggest gas station operator in Fayetteville and documents ""ghost"" vehicle movements to cover his tracks, it will eventually be found out. One of his underlings will figure out what's going on and report it (out of duty or jealousy, flip a coin), or an auditor will find and investigate inconsistencies, or the gate guard he has an arrangement with will be on temporary duty and the substitute stops the shipment and runs it up the chain of command. After the investigation settles, the civilians involved will be in federal prison, while Maj. Smith is busy making big rocks into little rocks at Leavenworth.

From our perspective, we think of corruption as something that people who have criminal inclinations would do. It breaks both the law and the social contract. It's something that happens outside the usual political and social system.

But in a society like Russia where corruption among ""normal"" people is endemic, it is an embedded part of the political and social system. It plays an *absolutely vital role* in how the ruling class maintains power. Endemic corruption is use of the state apparatus to extract [economic rent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_rent); these rents are then allotted to people all across society as a system of *patronage* to reinforce the sociopolitical system. Among those who have power but are on the lower end of the social ladder - patrolmen, guards, front-line bureaucrats, the guy who prints your driver's license - bribes and gifts are likely a vital supplement to their salaries to allow them to afford food and housing.

If the political elites suddenly decided to treat corruption as a serious crime, and punish anyone who accepts bribes or misappropriates state funds, it would be shutting down a vast system of patronage that buttresses their position as elites. They'd take a wrecking ball to a key pillar supporting their status. Anyone among the elites who tried to end corruption - and thus destroy the patronage system - would threaten the elite status of basically everyone they interacted with, and would likely lose their power.

In fact, it sounds like what you propose happened (metaphorically) in the Russian military. [Anatoliy Serdyukov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoly_Serdyukov) was appointed Minister of Defense in 2007, and was tasked with reducing corruption in the armed forces. After the disastrous (though still victorious) 2008 operation in Georgia, Serdyukov was also intended to lead the Russian military's initial restructuring and reform efforts. He had Putin's support at first, but despite that, he may have taken his tasks too seriously and alienated key constituencies by threatening their status in the patronage network. 

In 2012 Serdyukov was replaced by Sergei Shoigu, who is still the MoD 10 years later. Shoigu has no strong connections with Putin's traditional power base. He is not a *siloviki*, someone with a background in the state security services. He has no military experience. He essentially stumbled backwards into a cabinet position by virtue of being in the right place at the right time, and has parlayed that into 2 decades in Putin's inner circle. To show how Shoigu approaches his position - Serdyukov typically did his duties in business attire. Shoigu nearly always wears a military dress uniform. [Here he is in 2014, after two years on the job](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Sergey_Shoigu%2C_Vladimir_Putin%2C_Dmitry_Medvedev%2C_May_9%2C_2014.jpg) as defense minister. Remember, Shoigu has *no* military background; as far as I can tell, he didn't even serve as a conscript in the Soviet military. And yet he's accumulated quite the impressive array of military medals to decorate his uniform. Shoigu is from a middle class background, has held no highly compensated positions, and theoretically makes about $100k a year; [here is his $12 million house](https://roof.designuspro.com/en/zvezdy/gde-zhivet-sergey-shoygu-foto/). Given that Shoigu is the longest serving defense minister in the history of the Russian Federation and could easily be mistaken for [a tin-pot African dictator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-B%C3%A9del_Bokassa) (at least Bokassa actually earned his medals, having served with distinction in the Free French forces in WW2 and then in Indochina), I think it's reasonable to conclude that he has *not* been an anti-corruption crusader.

[],False,,bleepblopbloopy,,,[],,,,text,t2_4lu6l,False,False,"Russian troops are increasingly bogged down in Ukraine — and global sanctions have hit the Russian economy hard. As the economic costs of invading Ukraine rise, will the Kremlin look at cost-saving warfare strategies it used in Syria? The bombing of Ukrainian hospitals suggest Russia may be doing this already.

Our research on Russia’s campaign in Syria offers insights into what those strategies might entail. In Syria, Russian troops shifted the course of a civil war by destroying critical infrastructure from the air, deploying widespread siege tactics, and using paramilitary and local fighters to advance the country’s goals. If Russia’s intervention in Ukraine drags on, our findings suggest that Russian strategies along these lines will raise the costs for civilians significantly.

Russia waged a cheap war in Syria

Russia’s 2015 intervention in Syria was shaped by two things: ambitious goals and a limited budget. The Kremlin developed something of a playbook for this kind of intervention. First, Russia attacks with superior artillery and air capabilities. Russian forces assault populated areas and conduct precision strikes on critical civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, schools, water and energy infrastructure, rendering entire areas unlivable and disrupting rival governance systems.

Russia’s land grabs in Ukraine could break the international order

The Syrian regime regularly conducted strikes on hospitals in the early years of the conflict, but Russia’s intervention accelerated this tactic. Data from the Syrian Archive, an independent project that documents human rights violations, reveal that the Russian Air Force was responsible for almost three-quarters of strikes by pro-regime forces on medical facilities in Syria after 2015.

Second, Russia attempts to choke off areas of opposition. In Syria, sieges trapped entire urban populations in Aleppo, Eastern Ghouta, and elsewhere, and denied their access to food, medicine and other critical supplies. The combination of sieges and aerial bombardment led to forced surrender, reducing the need for a lengthy ground invasion that would lead to significant casualties on both sides. Relying on local ground troops and mercenaries in Syria also ensured low casualty counts for Russian troops.


Third, Russia uses disinformation to legitimize targeting that might constitute violations of international humanitarian law. The clearest example of this in Syria was Russia’s campaign against the Syria Civil Defense — globally known as the White Helmets — an organization of 3,000 search and rescue volunteers. A Russian government-backed disinformation campaign claiming that the White Helmets were terrorists or part of a CIA conspiracy took off on social and alternative media. This allowed Russia to paint its targets as legitimate, muddying the waters of clear war crimes.

Russia demoralized the resistance

Russia’s military tactics in Syria forced major shifts in civilian survival strategies. Prior to 2015, the Syrian government relied on relatively slow-moving helicopters that dropped primitive barrel bombs on rebel-held areas. But civilians began to adapt, going underground and developing extensive spotter networks to follow flight plans as an early warning system.


However, Russia’s intervention in 2015 took the destructive nature of this warfare to unprecedented levels by intensifying the “collective punishment” on civilians. Russia took charge of the skies, freeing up Syrian ground troops to tighten sieges around civilian-populated areas. By 2017, nearly 5 million people were living in besieged and hard-to-reach areas. With Russian Sukhoi jets targeting the areas under siege, civilians could no longer listen for the unmistakable sound of a helicopter coming and take cover.

More than 2 million people have already fled the Ukraine conflict. How will they fare in new countries?

Russia and the Syrian regime also deployed advanced weapons to break civilian morale in opposition-held areas. Russia’s use of thermobaric weapons and the Syrian government’s use of chemical weapons pushed civilians out of their makeshift bunkers — these explosives are more deadly in enclosed spaces, and chemicals like sarin and chlorine sink into basements.

Syrians subjected to these tactics adapted and developed early warning systems and self-protection strategies. But their ability to withstand both the physical and psychological onslaught suffered. As the years passed, disinformation campaigns and the influx of extremist elements also clouded their cause.


Russia has used some low-cost tactics in Ukraine

Russia’s approach to Syria was designed from the outset to be sustainable, costing an estimated $2 billion per year. But the current estimated deployment of nearly 200,000 troops in and around Ukraine is not. Some estimates put the cost of the Russian invasion at $7 billion in the first week alone.

Defense analysts report major stumbles in the Kremlin’s strategy in Ukraine — raising the likelihood of a protracted war. Fierce resistance and stalled progress may have prompted Russia to intensify its attacks via long-range weapons, U.S. officials note.

Will Russia rely on its Syria playbook to plan the next stages of the assault on Ukraine? Some developments suggest the Kremlin is already heading in that direction. Russian forces, for instance, are targeting critical civilian infrastructure, hitting residential buildings, kindergartens, communication towers and hospitals.


On March 4, Russian troops took control of a power plant that produces a fifth of Ukraine’s energy needs. And reports have emerged that the Russian military is deploying the TOS-1 Buratino launcher, capable of lobbing thermobaric weapons at close range. If Russia uses thermobaric bombs to attack those seeking shelter in Ukraine’s metro systems, high casualties are likely.

Check out all TMC's analysis of the Russia and Ukraine crisis in our new topic guide: Russia and its neighbors

Russia is also attempting to besiege major cities. Russian troops surrounded Mariupol, denying safe exit routes to civilians trying to escape the shelling. And a 40-mile Russian military convoy still sits outside Kyiv, where food reportedly is running low. U.S. officials also report that Russians are trying to recruit Syrians to fight in Ukraine.

Although Western governments have attempted to rebut Russian disinformation campaigns preemptively, the U.S. government has warned that Russia’s disinformation efforts could be a pretext to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine.


With Russia’s end game in Ukraine growing increasingly complicated, a strategy that relies on these low-cost tactics to pressure Ukrainians and the international community to compromise would significantly raise the cost to civilians in Ukraine. Russia’s track record in Syria suggests that the Kremlin may be comfortable with frozen conflicts that prolong civilian suffering while waiting for the international community to make concessions. The question for Ukraine is whether the growing weight of global sanctions and other international measures to punish Russia’s aggressive behavior can change that calculus.
