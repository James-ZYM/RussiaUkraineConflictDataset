Like a huge number of Russian citizens who are in favor of a special operation.  
Donbass militia leader Igor Strelkov generally despises Putin.  
Most of us know who he is.  
You have not opened my eyes to oligarchic capitalism and total corruption in Russia.

  
I'll just clarify here: corruption was in the USSR. But in Russia, thanks to US-led market and political reforms, corruption in Russia has taken on monstrous proportions. More than 60% of the budget plundered.

  
And this is done by Putin's friends, put in power by him.  
In public they are Patriots, but in reality their children and real estate in Europe.

  
Most people in Russia are patriots. We love our country and understand its problems very well.  
But replacing even such a bastard as Putin by force would mean handing over power to the United States again.  
As it was in Ukraine.

  
Russia is in a dead end.  
The dictatorship in this case, albeit oligarchic, did not allow the United States to seize the country, as it was in the 90s.  
Putin is a bastard, but he is our bastard.  
He is ready to betray the people, but not ready to betray the country.

  
We knew we had to do something, but we didn't know how.  
And then the West came to the rescue! -))  
You finally trampled on all your laws and imposed sanctions against Putin's oligarchs.  
You have done what we have long dreamed of!  
All these bitches lost almost all their prey.  
These bitches are now equated by the stupid West with the Nazis.

  
In fact, now all our thieves and traitors are left alone with the robbed and betrayed people -))  
They have nowhere else to run.

  
So as soon as we finish the denazification of Ukraine, as soon as we return it to its native harbor, we will deal with our ""heroes"".

&amp;#x200B;

  
I didn't say you were American.  
As well as did not claim that you are an American satellite.  
I don't know who you are, I was just describing the world you protect.

  


Don't talk to me about brainwashed.  
You use Facebook, Youtube and Instagram. Sites that are heavily censored. Platforms running algorithms that form an information bubble around a person.  
Even on Reddit, I can't just post a link to a Telegram channel. To do this, you need to make some kind of request -)  
Lol.  
Thanks to the stupid act of Facebook, it was finally banned in Russia. Like on Instagram.  
Now most Russian people have switched to Telegram.  
And Telegram is a paradise for free speech.  
This is the best platform of all existing social networks.  
Thanks to Pasha Durov.  
So don't talk to me about brainwashed.  
Think better of yourself.

  
No. Russia is not at all like the United States.  
We've been defending ourselves against this damn bastard all our lives.  
And defended others who dared to oppose him.  
No matter how scum and degenerate Putin is, compared to the United States, he is an angel.

  
During the 20 years of Putin's rule, the United States unleashed 3 full-scale wars and 10 revolutions.  
In 20 years, literally millions have died because of them. Tens of millions lost everything. I generally keep quiet about the damage to demographics.  
No matter how scum Putin is, he is not even close to the scum in the US and its satellite EU.

&amp;#x200B;

  
Russia is aware of the Chinese threat.  
We know that China is only its own friend.  
That's just the US-the enemy of the entire free world.",868047a759d34ade5e0f8887d428a3a927fa185a,True,False,,,,,0,1647992860,,0,{},i1qalrr,True,t3_tjawfu,False,True,t1_i1q4m6v,/r/war/comments/tjawfu/answer_to_arnold_schwarzenegger_from_maryana/i1qalrr/,1647992878,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1647964060.0,,,,

Putin really would be proud of you - and himself, for convincing you of this narrative. 

Fact : Putin, his technocrats and oligarchs, corruption and ineptitude have destroyed your economy all by yourself … but I get it’s a lot easier to blame “them”. 

It’s basic social psychology: Hajfel’s social identity theory, combined with Milgrem’s theory of obedience and you’ve got a potent mix of violent prejudice and conformity ( you - in a nutshell. But you don’t even see it. And that’s Putin’s greatest victory ). 

I’m not American by the way. 

But understand how convenient it is for brainwashed followers to conflate everything that’s bad with your fucked up country with “them”. 

At a macro level you’re strikingly similar to the US - same shit, packaged differently. Fucked up, corrupt and broken society. 

Major difference is your foreign policy is explicitly autocratic and expansionist : “ Friendship between the two States has no limits,” they vowed in the communiqué, released after the two leaders met on the eve of the Beijing Winter Olympics. “There are no ‘forbidden’ areas of cooperation.” The joint statement by China and Russia, Feb 14 this year. 

Your guy just wants to be Peter the great. Problem is he’s the junior partner to China - they effectively own you and your future.

1. You claimed that the Nazis in Ukraine are a lie.  
I proved to you that this is not a lie. There are indeed Nazis in Ukraine and there are many of them.  
In an attempt to justify your mistake, you changed the thesis from ""There are no Nazis in Ukraine"" to ""the presence of Nazis in Ukraine does not mean that this country is Nazi""  
This is sophistry.  
I did not convince you that the presence of Nazis in Ukraine means that Ukarina is a Nazi state.  
And this thesis was not discussed in our conversation.  
But we can discuss that too, if you admit your mistake.  
Which, of course, you won't do if you keep changing your original thesis in such a way as to avoid defeating the original thesis.  
Yes, there are Nazis in Russia. And you know what?  
They are now fighting on the side of Ukraine -))))  
It's true. Many of them ran away to fight on the side of Ukraine.  
Googled who Sergei Korotkikh with the call sign Boatswain is.  
And then - in Russia there are no military formations with neo-Nazi ideology.  
Just as there are no neo-Nazi parties and organizations supported by the authorities.  
2. No. This is not genocide. As much as you don't want it.  
Genocide has a very specific definition. And I convincingly proved that the actions of the Russians do not fall under this definition.  
You can even turn blue to prove that the Sun revolves around the Earth, but the facts do not care about your opinion.  
Separatists, the same citizens of Ukraine as the Nazis, whom they destroy.  
They will decide for themselves what is right for them and what is not.  
Your opinion doesn't matter to them.  
4. ""I really hope that the war will reach Russia and you will understand something there...""  
Ahahahaha-))  
This is humanism!  
In fact, exactly the same rhetoric is used by Russian and Ukrainian separatists.  
The Ukrainian army has been killing pro-Russian Ukrainians in Donetsk, Odessa, Lugansk and Mariupol for 8 years.  
And all these 8 years, the Ukrainians mocked the death of the ""separators""  
Here is what Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said:  
""we will drive the children of the separatists into the basements! And this is how we will win this war""  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVIDR9JSPFs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVIDR9JSPFs)

  
Ukrainians have been warned for 8 years not to kill pro-Russian residents of Donetsk and Lugansk.  
They were warned that if they continued, THEIR children would end up in the ""basements"".  
They laughed.  
Now. They cry.  
And this is fair.  
Regarding the invasion of Russian territory:  
Forward!  
Satan missiles and the Dead Hand system will happily send you to hell.

They can't simply say that, so they made up all the other BS to make this war seem somewhat legitimate.

I stated that 2 out of 3 would be false.  
Good-)  
Let's explore your myths:  
  
“There are no Nazis on Ukarin”  
Entire battalions of Nazis operate and operated in Ukraine.  
  
Battalions ""Azov"" [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azov\_Battalion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azov_Battalion)

  
Battalion ""Tornado"" [https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rota\_militsii\_""Tornado""](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rota_militsii_""Tornado"")

Aidar Battalion [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aidar\_Battalion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aidar_Battalion)

Battalion ""Donbass"" [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donbass\_Battalion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donbass_Battalion)

Battalion ""OUN"" [https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion\_""OUN""](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion_""OUN"")

  
And many others.  
The Right Sector organization also operates in Ukraine.  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right\_Sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_Sector)

  
He figured in the Maidan process (a 2014 coup organized by the United States).  
  
It included the most repulsed Nazis from all over Ukraine.  
  
I will not even talk about the Nazis who are now responsible for the defense of cities.  
  
For example, the defense of Odessa is headed by a Nazi from the Aidar battalion Maxim Marchenko. Zelensky personally put him there. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim\_Marchenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_Marchenko)

  
So, the myth that there are no Nazis in Ukraine has been trampled on.  
  
2. ""The Russians staged a genocide in Ukraine""  
  
Yes. This is an absolute lie.  
  
Genocide is a deliberate attempt to destroy citizens belonging to a particular nation.  
This means the total destruction of all citizens of Ukraine indiscriminately.  
This is an absolute lie.  
According to the UN, for almost a month of the war in Ukraine - from February 24 to March 20, 925 civilians were killed.  
It turns out that the Russian army of 150,000 soldiers kills 34 Ukrainians a day.  
And this despite the fact that all losses among the civilian population are recorded exclusively on the Russian army.  
It is clear that this does not fall under the definition of genocide.  
There are no ethnic cleansings in the cities and villages liberated by the Russian army.  
  
As an argument in favor of genocide, you can try to give me the example of the bombing of hospitals and schools and residential buildings.  
Air strikes on these objects occur solely due to the fact that Ukrainian nationalists deliberately equip them with firing points.  
This is done for the hype in the Western press. So that you can announce the ""monstrous deeds of the Russians"" and get weapons in return.  
  
Here are some examples:  
APU occupied a kindergarten. [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/e4qcqkU--YA](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/e4qcqkU--YA)

  
APU occupied the school [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/FXY7KLnQFLo](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/FXY7KLnQFLo)

  
 APU occupied another kindergarten  [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/d2CgioCTk2I](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/d2CgioCTk2I)

  
Artillery was placed near the school of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (local residents demand to remove it)  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkfqS\_JMM9o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkfqS_JMM9o)

  
There are many such videos.  
  
And I won't even tell you that 50% of Russians have relatives in Ukraine.  
We belong to the same ancient tribe - the Slavs.  
We have a common history that is over a thousand years old.  
Kyiv is the capital of Ukarina, for 300 years it was the capital of Russia.  
Kyiv is the mother of all Russian cities. So said Prince Oleg 1000 years ago.  
Russians are not satisfied with the genocide of Ukrainians.  
Your second lie and your myth have been successfully debunked.  
  
3. No. Separatists - pro-Russian citizens of Ukraine, are actually participating in a special operation of the Russian Federation.  
Yes, they attack the bastards who have been killing the inhabitants of Lugansk and Donetsk for 8 years.  
If you are wondering where the history of pro-Russian separatism in Ukraine comes from, I recommend that you familiarize yourself with such events as the massacre on May 2, 2014 in Odessa, in the House of Trade Unions.  
With events such as the massacre in Mariupol on May 9, 2014.  
With events such as the explosion of the building of the Luhansk administration on June 2, 2014.  
And many others.

  
As I wrote in a previous post: give me 3 of your favorite posts about Ukraine and 2 of them will turn out to be lies.  
You gave me three myths.  
And two of them turned out to be lies.",6f667661b956dfb55c5f2cf9b228010fb42434e5,True,False,,,,,0,1647964307,,0,{},i1oaci9,True,t3_tjawfu,False,False,t1_i1nt455,/r/war/comments/tjawfu/answer_to_arnold_schwarzenegger_from_maryana/i1oaci9/,1647964323,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1647935507.0,,,,

Unit for unit, NATO naval, air, and ground formations appear to be far better equipped, trained, and supplied than the Russian army. The biggest issue for NATO could simply be the high cost of equipment and human attrition that comes with any large scale military maneuver against a prepared enemy. NATO casualties would probably be much lower than estimates from a few years ago, and for sure much lower than NATO believed in the cold war. 

NATO would be able to beat the Russians silly in any pitched fight, but strategically, NATO advances could end up stalling out at the outer edges of the supply chain. Where NATO could run into trouble is that a war with Russia will use up ammunition and fuel at rates that haven't been seen before - more than WW2, more than the Gulf wars. Getting that fuel and ammo to the front lines will be almost as hard for NATO units entering Russian territory as it has been for Russian units in Ukraine. NATO formations have much better logistics, but they would still be stuck using the same shoddy road and rail networks that are failing to keep up with the Russian army needs in Ukraine. 

If the war turns into one where advances require stock piling supplies in advance for localized pushes, then a quasi trench style war could develop. I could see NATO capturing St. Petersburg,  overrunning most of Belarus, and getting close to Moscow before NATO casualties and convince NATO leadership to pursue a diplomatic solution. Unlike WW2, I don't see Russia having anywhere near the capacity mount a strategically meaningful counter-offensive. Peace would be negotiated from the perspective of NATO avoiding long term occupation costs and the logistical demands of continuing an offensive across very long supply line.

I mean animals, right?  
Very American.  
And very Ukrainian. They also compare Russians and pro-Russian Ukrainians to animals. They are called Colorado beetles and pig dogs.  
And it's so Nazi... well... comparing humans to animals.

  
The problem of my country, like any other, which does not want to be the periphery of American capitalism, is the global, crazy, bloody and cynical US hegemon.  
Is this not your country?  
The one that unleashes wars around the world. Kills hundreds of thousands and millions of people. Sponsors and organizes revolutions around the world.  
This is my country's problem. And all those countries that do not want to be under the heel of the protectorate of the United States and the dollar.

  
In the USSR, a huge number of valuable and joyful things were available.  
It's just that in the USSR it was not measured in money.

  
What goods and services should leave Russia now?  
Facebook and Instagram?  
McDonald's and CFS?  
Nike and Prada?  
THANKS! This should have been done a long time ago.

  
I remember very well how there were Russian restaurants and home businesses in my country. And how it was gradually, completely replaced by American, turning my country into a gas station.

  
The liberation of the market from monopolists that do not allow the development of the domestic market is a boon for any country.  


  
Whatever we do with Putin, we will deal with it ourselves. He has already taken a course from which he cannot turn.

  
Russians won't come? Ahahahaha-)  
What do you take my country for? For the county of Monaco?  
The Russians will travel. Just not in your countries. To hell with them.  
Russia is the biggest country in the world. We have regions with eternal summer and eternal winter. We have seas and lakes. We have deserts and tundra. We have oceans washing our shores.  
We have everything your heart desires.  
We don't need the West, or the US, or anyone else.  
It's a pity that we only now realized this.

  
We, as the Indians of America, believed in the economy and the promises of the United States, and destroyed OUR COUNTRY in 1991.  
Became a filling station in the US and Europe. We allowed these crazy bastards to dismantle and sell all our plants and factories.  
That's when we destroyed our economy!  
And now, we will begin to restore it.

  
Your free world was silent while the US committed genocide in Vietnam.  
Your free world has been silent while 500,000 children have died in Iraq due to US sanctions.  
Your free world was silent when the US decided to wipe Iraq off the face of the earth by bombing another half a million people.  
Your free world was silent when NATO decided to bomb Yugoslavia.  
Your free world was silent when the US and NATO decided to bomb Libya.  
Your free world was silent when the US and its allies decided to bomb Syria.  
Your free world sat silently while the Ukrainian military killed children and pro-Russian residents of Donetsk, Luhansk and Odessa.

  
Shove your self-proclaimed free world up your ass!

  
Real freedom does not need a master who decides for a slave how to build his country, his economy, his politics and his thoughts.  
True freedom does not need a master who decides when the slave will lament over the murders of the innocent, and when he needs to shut up, because the master himself decided to stain his hands with blood.

  
True freedom requires strength and will.  
A slave who escaped from the owner will find it very difficult at first.  
Of course, other slaves will discourage a disobedient slave from running away.  
And if this slave also intends to kill the overseer during the escape, then they will scream out of indignation.  
How dare he!  
But if he does this, a new, wonderful life awaits him without the dictatorship and hypocrisy of the owner.  
He can decide for himself what to do and when.

  
True freedom requires willpower and fearlessness.  
American satellites have not known what freedom is for a long time.

Are you sure Ukrainians want to go to the country where they are called nazis and whose soldiers were given the command to “wipe it off the face of the earth”?

Regardless, this is a typical from the Soviet Union. 
In 1944, after capturing crimea, the Stalin ordered all Crimean tatars to be taken on a train and forcibly deported to other parts of Russia in completely different societies. This, in fact, can be classified as genocide. As they are forcibly emigrated and separated from their ethnic group, it destroys the physical group. After this was done, they immigrated a large number of Russian generals and civilians. This is was actually done all over soviet ukraine. Especially in the east of the country. In the last 20 years, the Ukrainians from these areas (many of whom have roots to the Russian population) are the ones to reject the social push to the west, because they have a connection to Russia. Ukraine did this to all its neighbors, to destroy their languages, cultures and societies. This is why Russia wants Ukrainians to go there so much. Also for propaganda purposes obviously. 

The Ukrainians in Russia, so far, have also been treated very poorly, as they fare required to give away any Ukrainian documentation and are then put in camps in eastern Russia.",a091b129ba92d75733c71bb3dcbf7b4353dcf087,True,False,,,,,0,1647948513,,0,{},i1ncoxh,False,t3_tinmkp,False,True,t1_i1m2myh,/r/war/comments/tinmkp/citizens_of_temporarily_occupied_kherson_ukraine/i1ncoxh/,1647948528,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1647919713.0,,,,

I’m torn on that concept about Libya though, because of self Interest and how it corrupts any end goal. If you look into Gaddafi’s rule, it’s clear power corrupted him too but he did ALOT of good in the first years of rule and despite the issues, Libya would have still been better off than it is now. Self interest skews everything. Libya did and still does have a lot of natural resource, and the starting civil dispute was between civilian militia and Gaddafi, because he didn’t want to step down and chose to be tyrannical bully about it but US intervention escalated this heavily. Those same ‘freedom fighters’ killed every single person in gaddafi’s quarters, that wasn’t a small number either, it had children and women there too. All slaughtered and some of them raped (again these conflicts always bring out the demon in the people that claim to want peace) They also murdered countless Africans and immigrants because they feared they would side with Gaddafi, it takes away all my sympathy for them. USA bombed water towers and other essential buildings that are still today considered war crimes, they were calculated hits not accidental, this meant they hurt everyone including those they tried to help.

It’s all sad imo, and it’s usually the ones that give their ‘helping hand’ just like Putin and the states he wanted to ‘help’ that really cause the true pain for society. Their missions always sound true but once they see a chance to attain wealth and power, they corrupt everyone around them to get it.",cd9d4c48daad9903709ba5852ba9e24871fe67e1,True,False,,,,,0,1647944606,,0,{},i1n7cky,False,t3_tj9gve,False,True,t1_i1n6ken,/r/war/comments/tj9gve/19_years_ago_today_the_us_bombed_bagdad_1_million/i1n7cky/,1647944619,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1647915806.0,,,,

If you live anywhere with a high crime rate you’ll know the amount of crimes that never get looked into or make the news.

Google:

What about British War crimes? The rapes in camp breadbasket wouldn’t have been the only instance. What about this report: https://www.icc-cpi.int/itemsDocuments/201209-otp-final-report-iraq-uk-eng.pdf

“ The report also confirms that there were at least three incidents in which Iraqi children were tortured by British soldiers; two of the incidents occurred at one location in 2003, and the other incident occurred at a separate location in 2004. None of the soldiers who committed war crimes against children in these incidents have been prosecuted in Britain, and the ICC has also declined to take action against them.”

Since you want to use examples of Russian war crimes outside of the Middle East what about US war crimes in Libya?

The point isn’t to free the responsibility of the evil committed by Russian Soldiers. It’s the fact that until we truly want JUSTICE for all, there wont be justice for any.

The top pic upsets me because it shows a more innocent world not long ago, a world most of us still live in.  Now, like Syria, Ukraine lives in a world that those that lived and died and fought and cried during world war II would easily recognize.     

Putin says he is fighting nazis on behalf of the world as if he was doing everyone a favor.   Much like Hitler felt he was doing the world a favor by fighting Russians.   What rubbish.      

This must stop.   Now the world waits to see how China sees the world and the part she plays in it.  Does China bow to a traditional old worldview, second to Russia, or will she declare herself above the  aspirations of yet another failed Caesar and step up as a leader by demanding Russia stop this war.      Personally i dont see that happening but i know i would sleep a lot better knowing that China was capable of seeing past current rivalries with the US to make the only right decision here.   

China is in a unique position to take THE leading roll in this crisis as it becomes clearer every day that the US does not wish to lead on this issue or is not capable.

We are doing our best to keep out actual state sponsored propaganda and if you saw the mod log you may have a different opinion.

We have had actual bots attack the sub, we've had people spamming video game footage trying to pass it off as real, so much gay porn and actual shitposts posted, you never see any of that.

We have dozens of people every day trying to pimp their shitty blog or YouTube channel, we try to review every video and post to make sure it isn't garbage.

We've adjusted automod significantly to reduce the amount of spam and bot attacks, we had to deal with a bot attack that bombed modmail with hundreds of spam messages that slowed down our responses to reports.

Ukraine’s New Military Security Strategy
91
05.05.2021
Ukraine’s new Military Security Strategy, adopted in March 2021, is based on the concept of comprehensive security. The potential for further Russian incursions is to be prevented by raising the costs of aggression through, among other things, the development of territorial defence forces, the modernisation of armaments, and the use of asymmetric defensive actions. The strategy sets achievable goals and its implementation will have a positive impact on Ukraine’s ability to defend itself against a massive Russian invasion. However, it will not prevent periodic escalations along the demarcation line in Donbas.
Maciej Zaniewicz

The Strategy’s Assumptions
Approved by President Volodymyr Zelensky on 25 March 2021, Ukraine’s new Military Security Strategy replaces the 2015 Military Doctrine formulated during the fierce first phase of the conflict with Russia. The previous document stipulated that Ukraine should aim to achieve the ability to defend itself against Russian aggression on its own and to achieve full interoperability with NATO forces by 2020. Both goals were overly ambitious and not met.

The Military Security Strategy assumes that the aggressive policy of the Russian Federation, which has been identified as a military adversary, continues to be the greatest threat to Ukraine’s security. The document assesses aggression by another state or dragging Ukraine into an external conflict as less likely. Ukraine’s main objective is to deter Russia from further escalation of the war by increasing the cost of a potential offensive and occupation to an unacceptable level. Deterrence is to be achieved through diplomatic means and the implementation of a comprehensive security concept that considers both military and non-military activities, such as propaganda and cyber warfare. It is intended to maximise the use of Ukraine’s potential without over-militarising the country.

The Military Aspect
The strategy indicates the need to adapt the armed forces to operate on the modern battlefield, given the experience of the war with Russia. Great emphasis is put on the development of tactical missile and anti-aircraft forces as well as use of drones, satellite communications and navigation to increase the cost of conducting military operations by an aggressor on Ukrainian territory. It is planned to implement the concept of network-centric warfare, which envisages the creation of an information exchange network using modern communication and reconnaissance systems and decentralisation of command. This is intended to enable Ukraine to conduct asymmetric operations against a stronger opponent.

The strategy gives priority to the modernisation and use of the land forces, which are to cooperate with Ukrainian society in ensuring the defence of the country. At present, a contract army forms the basis of the armed forces. It is supplemented by conscription and voluntary service in the reserve and territorial defence forces. The strategy envisages the development of territorial defence potential and the replacement of conscription with compulsory training in the reserves, which would prepare society for the creation of a resistance movement in case of occupation.

The strategy outlines a defence scenario divided into four stages. In the first, regular armed forces and territorial defence forces are to be used. They will aim to deter offensives using asymmetric actions, including in enemy territory. The second stage includes support from reserve forces and the formation of resistance in occupied areas. This is to gain the time needed to implement the third stage, which is to carry out general mobilisation and obtain foreign military support. The fourth stage is to be post-conflict stabilisation using the armed forces.

The strategy deals superficially with the issues of the modernisation of the navy. Although, unlike the Military Doctrine, it highlights the potential threat to shipping in the Black and Azov seas posed by Russia’s aggressive policy, it limits itself to increasing reconnaissance and missile strike capabilities. The strategy does not mention the reinforcement of the fleet with small coastal defence vessels, which is currently being undertaken. The modernisation of the air force likewise has been treated superficially. The strategy only mentions the need to acquire multirole combat aircraft in the long term.

The Non-Military Aspect
To stop Russia’s aggressive actions, the strategy envisages the use of international political and economic sanctions. Ukraine is to strive for their extension and the imposition of new ones in case of further hostile actions on the part of Russia (e.g., violation of the ceasefire in Donbas). The strategy, in contrast to the Military Doctrine, does not directly point to the possibility of regaining control over the occupied territories as a result of a military operation. This is to be achieved through diplomatic efforts. One example of these is the Ukrainian efforts to set up the Crimean Platform in which states that oppose the occupation of the peninsula (Poland, Turkey, the U.S. and the UK have declared their support) would participate.

According to the strategy, Ukraine’s defence policy is designed to lead to NATO membership. Further implementation of NATO standards, increasing the interoperability of the Ukrainian Armed Forces with the forces of the Alliance, and fulfilling the criteria for NATO membership are envisaged. Increasing Ukraine’s involvement in international NATO missions is also intended to bring the prospect of accession closer. This is meant to build Ukraine’s position as a potentially valuable ally, not only a “recipient” of international security but also a “provider”. Currently, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are taking part in NATO operations in Kosovo and Afghanistan. In April this year, Ukraine announced its intention to become involved in missions in the Mediterranean Sea and Iraq.

Given its limited financial and technological capabilities, Ukraine will seek international technical and financial support for the modernisation of the army and cooperation with foreign investors in the joint production of armaments. Actions in this direction are already being taken: for example, the Ukrainian-Turkish joint-venture Black Sea Shield is working on guided anti-tank missiles, drones, and radio-electronic warfare systems. Ukraine has signed a letter of intent with the United Kingdom on the construction of missile boats as well.

Conclusions
The defence strategy is less ambitious than the doctrine that preceded it, but it is characterised by greater realism in the selection of measures aimed at strengthening Ukraine’s deterrent potential. The focus on the development of the ground forces, especially the mobilisation capabilities of the reserve and territorial defence forces, stems from the experience of the war with Russia, when poor training and equipment, as well as problems in conscription, made it impossible to effectively resist the well-trained Russian infantry. The measures envisaged by the strategy should reduce the likelihood of a repeat of the scenario of the annexation of Crimea and the occupation of Donbas. However, they will not prevent periodic escalations of conflict along the demarcation line, which are provocations by Russia to exert political pressure on Ukraine, NATO, and the EU.

Investment in the air force and navy has received cursory attention, which may result in a decline in their combat potential in the medium term. Modernisation of these types of armed forces is the most expensive, and Ukraine’s economic potential does not allow it to strengthen them to a level that would prevent Russia from dominating Ukraine’s airspace and sea. However, the development of missile and air defence forces and the acquisition of coastal defence vessels would allow Ukraine to partially replace these capabilities, using its defence industry.

Further support for Ukraine from NATO countries—financial and in the form of military equipment and exercises—will be necessary to fully implement the strategy. Poland may intensify military cooperation with Ukraine by conducting joint exercises of Ukrainian and Polish territorial defence forces and developing joint armaments, in particular artillery, radar and communications systems, and drones. Poland may also seek to increase the effectiveness of cooperation within the Lithuanian-Polish-Ukrainian brigade (LITPOLUKRBRIG).",f0979b4baf090771d4a88f682a45a23f4a1471e6,True,False,,,,,0,1647912897,,0,{},i1lwo0e,True,t3_tjrmeg,False,True,t3_tjrmeg,/r/war/comments/tjrmeg/interesting_article_about_ukranian_military/i1lwo0e/,1647912909,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1647884097.0,,,,

Putin has exiled you and your in-group to a desolate, bleak future. If you’re young, you basically have no future - no freedom, no prospects at all, nothing to look forward to or aspire to. You won’t be able to travel overseas. No one will let you in. Desolation, poverty, repudiation, and hatred - all sown by Putin. He despises you nearly as much as he hates democratic freedom. AND YOU CHOSE THIS. 

You had a future,and that is now gone. You’re a pariah existing within a pariah state - your future is as bleak as those who exist in North Korea: arguably worse. 

Your economy is decimated and will not return - not in our lifetime, maybe ever.
