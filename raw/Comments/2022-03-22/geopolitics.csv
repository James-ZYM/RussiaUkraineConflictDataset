[],False,,PitonSaJupitera,,,,,,"I think direct comparisons to Iraq are meaningless. Those cases are too different.

First, Ukraine is physically larger and has larger population than Iraq.

Second, Iraq was already seriously militarily degraded since 1991 and under sanctions for a decade. Ukraine has instead been receiving massive quantities of weapons. They have far better air defenses than Iraq had in 2003. The number of air defenses is also comparable to number of combat jets Russia has allocated for the invasion (\~300). At the same time Ukrainians are receiving data from AWACS - they don't need to turn on their radars until Russia aircraft are within range.

Invasion of Ukraine under those conditions would always be much harder than invasion of Iraq. Of course, Russia has a lot of issues in addition to this, but it seems to me that fundamental mistake was relying on the idea Ukrainians will give up. That dictated the overall strategy, number of troops assigned, lack of preparation of domestic population, etc.  It doomed any chance of a quick victory (if it was ever possible) because Russia simply wasn't doing the high intensity war necessary to achieve it.

Because that plan has failed, Russians are now switching to a different one - securing the land bridge to Crimea (which is now almost complete and only requires seizing Mariupol), taking over all/most of Donbas and destroying Ukrainian army there. If things get stalled, they'll simply use their long-range missiles to destroy Ukrainian industry and economy until Ukrainians give in. UNDP has some very dark prediction about Ukraine's economic situation which could easily get worse if Russia starts systematically destroying their economic base. At the point Zelensky will face a choice of keeping the war hoping to reclaim the territory they'll likely never take back while Ukraine's future economic prospects become worse very day or accept Russian demands and start trying to rebuild the country with help from EU. 

I need to remind everyone that the picture we are seeing is incredibly biased in Ukraine's favor because we have very little information about what kind of casualties and damage they're taking. We only learnt of few high casualty incidents (three strikes on barracks). We have no idea if they have their own ammunition, fuel or supply issues or how much equipment they lost. They're certainly not going to advertise that to everyone if they are encountering problems. Let's also remember that Russia is destroying at least around 10 targets (a low-end estimate) every day with their cruise missile - except in a small number of cases we don't know what they're hitting. Aside from the position of front lines, we know almost nothing about how things are going for Ukraine at this point. It's hard to get a good prediction when you're observing just one side in war.",985ced3422b6439d6d2c27a7876bd42d60122fbb,True,False,,,,,0,1647990409,,0,{},i1q4ybt,False,t3_t020va,False,True,t1_i1nr9lm,/r/geopolitics/comments/t020va/russia_invasion_of_ukraine_live_thread/i1q4ybt/,1647990422,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647961609.0,[],text,t2_3uursvcq,False,False

The progress is called ""slow"" largely based on dubiously-founded assumptions that the invasion was supposed to be over in a week at the most.

&gt;Not having taken Kiev yet? Can't be due to unexpected amounts of resistance, nope

He actually does acknowledge that the Ukrainians have put up more of a fight than pretty much anyone had anticipated, and that the Russians are going to have to use more force than they had originally hoped for to win in Ukraine, but also holds that they did prepare for this possibility and are adjusting their approach accordingly so it's not a major setback. In the end, without direct knowledge of Russian plans and of what's going on in Kiev, we can't yet know for sure what's the reason behind them not having taken the city, so the claim of it being due solely to unexpected Ukrainian resistance is as yet as unverifiable as the claim of it being a part of the plan. His arguments for the latter sound convincing to me, while arguments for the former sound convincing to you, and that's all fine.

As to your broader point, I understand how you conclude that Ritter is ""rewriting history"", as it were, so that everything that happens is always a part of the Russian plan, but I don't think it's to the degree you make it out to be.

I - foolishly - asked a lot of questions while I was in Ruhengeri, because I'm medical and wanted to know what had happened to my recently-deceased colleagues (note: I never met the three deceased. We just work in the same field, so ""colleagues"" is how I think of them).  
Based on what the Rwandan people told me and a decent knowledge of the political reality of the time, I've always been confident that the locals version of events was spot on.  
Just spent an hour or so researching this, and it sound like they were right - this was a Tutsi/RPF massacre by an ""espionage unit"" led by Karenzi Karake. It seems that Karake did well for himself and ended up as a RPF Lieutenant-General before falling from grace.  
Media back in January 1997 reported it as Hutu militia - the cover story, as explained to me contemporaneously.

  
""The exact circumstances of the attack remain unclear, but the latest reports state that the Interahamwe militia was involved in the attack. The injured American coordinator has been evacuated to Kigali. He will be flown to Nairobi and then back to the United States. Two other humanitarian relief organizations installations, Medécins sans Frontier-Holland and Save the Children, were apparently attacked.""

  
It seems CNN fully brought the government story:

  
""The three victims, reportedly shot dead by Hutu rebels, worked for Medecins du Monde (Doctors of the World), which on Sunday suspended all its operations in Rwanda.Three Rwandan soldiers were also killed in the attack in the northwestern town of Ruhengeri, 40 miles northwest of Kigali. An American was seriously wounded. Rwandan cabinet ministers visiting South Africa blamed the massacre on ""criminals"" among the flood of refugees returning from Zaire.""

The incident had not been entirely forgotten in Spain, which led to Karenzi Karake getting himself arrested in the UK.

  
""The arrest of Karake at the hands of the British police, known on Monday night in the BBC2 Newsnight program, takes place following the order issued by the Spanish judge Fernando Andreu in 2008. Andreu accuses Karake and 39 other people, members of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), genocide, crimes against humanity and terrorism, resulting in hundreds of civilian deaths. The actions of the RPF commanded by Karake were allegedly in retaliation against the Hutus for the genocide of Tutsis and moderate Hutus that took place between April and mid-July 1994, which resulted in 800,000 deaths.""  
That's absolutely what was happening. Gunfire at night, dozens of Hutus getting killed for ""breaking curfew"" (executions). It was definitely payback time.  
The really interesting bit of information is this, because it gels exactly with what everyone back in 1997 said was the motivation:

  
**""The indictment against Karake is based on the testimony of a member of his espionage unit who told Fernando Andreu that Karake had ordered the killings because ""these whites had sensitive information about the recent massacres \[in 1997\] of the RPF against the Hutus.""**

  
I went into the country feeling that it would be safe enough because the RPF had a significant presence in the area I was going to, and I too bought the ""Hutu militia"" cover story. That feeling of security evaporated as local after local told me exactly what had actually happened - it wasn't a well-kept secret, they even told me details of the killings that check out now I've done a bit of research. I am confident that one of the guys I spoke to was either there or had spoken directly to people who were there when the three aid workers were killed.

  
It's been 25 years, and I still remember the fear of slowly realizing that the RPF really didn't want me and my two buddies around asking so many questions either.

Without the efforts of Kagame and the RPF  I'm probably not alive today. His policy on forbidding the public acknowledgement of Tutsi and Hutu divide, while effective on quelling the tension in younger generations might just be a mask for the very anglo-tutsi dominated government and economic elite. On top of that his restriction on the press, free speech and political opponents is very unnerving even amongst the population.

And while Rwanda markets itself as being a fast developing nation, life in the country is still very difficult. Rwanda is surprisingly expensive considering the median income.

Whatever happens, he always portays it as it being the intentional plan all along. Slow progress? Can't be failure of logistics, must be slow on purpose.

Not having taken Kiev yet? Can't be due to unexpected amounts of resistance, nope, the Russians never intended to take Kiev. They just wanna pressure Zelensky for concessions.

If Russians were to start retreating on one front, I'm sure he'd say it was intended all along and all part of the masterplan.

&gt;Then there's also the possibility that Russia has been progressing slowly at least in part because they're trying to minimize civilian casualties.

I agree that Russia definitely tried to be light-handed with civilians in the first week of the invasion.

That's true but it's also meaningless as an objection unless you specify what their objectives are supposed to be. To take and hold territory? To grind down the Ukrainian army?

[],False,,Venboven,,,,,,"An interesting tidbit that I don't see many others talking about is that the Hadi government split in two several years ago.

The ""Southern Transitional Council,"" which currently controls Aden and the surrounding Lahij province, as well as the city of Al Mukalla in the east and the island of Socotra in the south, split from the Hadi government in 2017 when Hadi dismissed the governor of Aden: Aidarus al-Zoubaidi. Hadi was worried that Zoubaidi had too-close ties to the United Arab Emirates (the UAE), who were practically occupying the capital city.

Zoubaidi had a lot of support in Aden, and with the help of the UAE, in 2018, he initiated a coup d'etat and ousted Hadi's government from Aden. The UAE sent forces to occupy Socotra, and armed supporters of Zoubaidi rose up in several areas in southern Yemen.

The Hadi government was in a state of emergency at this point and sent troops to quell the rebellions, but they did not manage to recapture the capital. They now base their operations out of Ataq, a small city and oil center in central Yemen.

The two governments, despite the battle they waged against each other over Aden, both still fought separately against the Houthis, and eventually they agreed to a ceasefire, and actually signed an agreement in late 2020 stating that after the war they would reconcile and both parties would have equal representation in a new government. This agreement, pushed for by Saudi Arabia, took years of negotiation by all parties.

So, why did the Southern Transitional Council rise up in the first place? Well, as we said, Zoubaidi was dismissed by Hadi for his questionable loyalty. Obviously Hadi was right about that, as the UAE helped Zoubaidi initiate the coup after he was dismissed. So, the bigger question then is: why does the UAE support Zoubaidi? Well, it's ideological. See, in the Hadi government, there is a group called Al-Islah, which is a political party with strong conservative Muslim views. They are supported by Saudi Arabia and the Hadi government. Their sister-party in the UAE is affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood, which is an advocate of Sharia Law and Jihadism, or the the crusade of Islam against the world. The UAE is very against this. They are more Western and secular oriented and do not support this traditionalist and rather extremist Islamic view. So, because Al-Islah is affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood, the UAE, for a long time, avoided cooperating with them in the Hadi government, and tensions between the Hadi government and the UAE got continuously worse. Eventually, the UAE used Zoubaidi as an excuse to separate themselves entirely from the Hadi government.

Thankfully, tensions between Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and hence, the tensions between the Hadi government and the Southern Transitional Council, have been greatly restored and cooperation against the Houthis is now at an all time high.

The war itself is at a stalemate and the presence of Al Qaeda which was once prominent in eastern Yemen has been largely dealt with and greatly reduced thanks to international intervention. Likely, the Houthis and the Hadi/Southern Transitional Council governments will sign a peace agreement where the Houthis become their own country, and the two coalition governments will reunite under a new government and constitution based out of Aden.

Because Mariupol is in the southeast corner of Ukraine, far smaller than Kyiv, and is largely surrounded by Russian troops, we can deduce that the Russians will take that city.

Be that judgment as it is, it is clear the Russians will not abort, and will continue trying to subdue the city.  Russian victory seems imminent.

How are the Russians supposed to do that without killing civilians?   There are an unknown number of Ukrainian fighters in Mariupol; we can assume they include snipers who are shooting Russians as this is written.  One only has the briefly read the history of the failed German attempt to take Stalingrad in fall 1942 to understand how deadly snipers holded up in buildings can be to an assailing force.

The Russian attack on Mariupol is a good example of a case where we will see divergent opinions over what constitutes war crimes.",34c5c3a40c6cdda8c18f1a53ed56f916163b5028,True,False,,,,,0,1647946232,,0,{},i1n9fud,False,t3_tjzr35,False,True,t3_tjzr35,/r/geopolitics/comments/tjzr35/the_term_war_crimes_is_a_strange_juxtaposition/i1n9fud/,1647946245,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647917432.0,[],text,t2_16uqw4,False,False

[],False,,daynomate,,,,,,"&gt; How Capitalism is supposed to function (from the point of the West) is that it's supposed to create profit. Wealth created from said investment is greater than the cost inputs.

Good point - I guess capitalism infers markets and they are dynamic, but that there has to be that cream on the top otherwise why bother doing it. 

&gt; What is supposed to happen next is that the State gets a shared percentage and invest in Human Capital. A highly educated populace will figure out what to do with economic capital, thereby causing an upward trajectory of wealth.

The way I see it is capitalism can't exist on it's own, it has to live on a suitable level of stability or it comes unstuck. Political and military control will overcome capital controls in a given state without some larger power to support it there. So as a contributor to the society it needs to help fund the systems that provide the stability. You don't want a society that burns out it's social wealth at the expense of concentrated profit in the hands of a few - if it gets there it needs to be from profit that comes second in line once the sustainable support is funded. Ideally if this was implemented in the most ideal way, efficiently, you'd have the lowest possible tax while still funding the stability of your society. 

&gt; The assumption is that an educated populace will figure out how to look out for themselves, preventing the state from dominating society. Society is to shape the state, not state shaping society.

The trouble is they have to get educated somehow. And pure capitalism doesn't value human capital beyond what it requires for it's own needs. And it all has to happen free of human intervention swayed by anti-social human nature for it to be whole. That never happens so we need controls - and they have to be funded. So because this society needs to have controls that trump the capitalist growth at the social expense. Capitalism won't self-regulate like that.

&gt; Miseducation of society, in the form of fake news, biases, or simply not able to get a quality education, can affect the states ability to grow towards that upward trajectory.

I feel like those are end results of a long path of winding down societal value by privatisation - and thereby handballing control to capitalist entities - of social institutions. The idea of for-profit correctional institutions would have to be one of the most vulgar and anti-human examples of this. 

&gt; I feel like typing out of all this, I'm just restating you.

&gt; I guess to response to China, it's up to their Society to decide. China suppresses information to the public to fight for itself, though as a China watcher, i don't know how good it is for human or economic capital growth if such a revolution would truly be good for the country of China.

I'm only a lay person on international relations and economics, but I feel that China has managed to control for a long period, a social system that overrules the capitalist system - but still makes good it's efficiencies in mostly unregulated markets for international competition. Perhaps it is our much more liberal focused-first social policies that make our job so much harder to keep capitalist impacts in check. The flow of money in decision making of US senate bills for instance is an antithesis of democracy yet it's still allowed to run more or less unfetted. That there is no riots on the street over bank bailouts are a sign of the cultural acceptance of supporting private capitalist systems. 

Russia on the other hand I feel has failed to allow unregulated markets to run their industries. Instead they've basically formed a giant mob with the Oligarchs as captains under the KGB as mob boss. It's no wonder they failed. 
 
&gt; Europe and America had almost 150 years of natural capitalistic growth. While the east Asian tigers relied on authoritarianism to grow and gradually democratized as their countries grew wealthy, there hasn't been many countries outside to grow out like that aside from Chile.
&gt; 
&gt; China has been growing at a miraculous pace, though, it's still remarkably slow. It took China 19 years to grow GDP per Capita from 1,000 USD to 10,000 USD ( nominal ). For Korea, in 1987, when during its democratic uprising, adjusted for inflation GDP per capita was around 8,600 USD.
&gt; 
&gt; Interestingly, Thailand recently had it's own modern democractic movement, with adjusted GDP per capita around 7,000 USD, though nothing came up of it.
&gt; 
&gt; I guess we will see what will come of China's own democratic movement. It will come sooner or later, most likely later, but it will arrive. Seeing how China is slowly homogenizing itself, the state will maintain its bureaucracy to conform society to the state, but there is always the flow between the two, so eventually it the cycle will change, whether it's organic, or forced.

The US is providing strategic assistance in terms of selling weapons (and maybe intel etc?). They were briefly involved themselves after the houthis fired missiles at an american warship that was ostensibly 'safeguarding' the bab al mandab strait (entrance to the red sea), Basically some air strikes

&gt; Iran

Iran at least initially were arming and funding the houthi movement, so this could be interpreted as a proxy war between saudi and iran. However, there seems to be very much conflicting evidence as to whether their support is substantial and ongoing or not. For instance the Houthis have gained ballistic missiles from when they overran the yemeni govt (first non-state actors in history to do so), but there are also seemingly credible accusations that Iran are supplying them with contemporary iranian-made ballistic missiles.

 &gt; and Al Qaeda's envolvements on the whole conflict

Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) are a bit all over the place. They control pockets of territory all over the country, and they have at times 'sided' with the coalition due to their shared interests in both being against the houthis.

For instance early in the war there's an allegation that the Saudi's/ UAE paid AQAP off to leave a town and let them 'free it'. There's also a claim that AQAP members are fighting with the coalition on the side of the yemeni troops, but i think this probably overestimates the 'ideological' position of those 'AQAP members'. My guess would be that similar with a lot of ISIS members, they are just jumping on whatever bandwagon looks like it may give them food and relative security.",f2b31bfc2c410dd5123f10c1bd7436de43f7815b,True,False,,,,,0,1647938878,,0,{},i1n0ogb,False,t3_tjrw67,False,True,t3_tjrw67,/r/geopolitics/comments/tjrw67/the_yemen_conflict/i1n0ogb/,1647938891,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647910078.0,[],text,t2_b230l,False,False

A wildcard is the economic and political situation in Russia, which could potentially deteriorate to a point where the Russian negotiating positing is shifted somewhat in favour of a faster end of the war rather than seeing it through to the bitter end.

Forced regime change is still possible, but unlikely, for the same reason that a full occupation is not really in the cards: Russia can't sustain a government (violently) rejected by a majority of Ukrainians with the limited of amount of resources at its disposal.

That's about what the British had in both Northern Ireland (conventional + RUC) and Malaysia (not including the local forces). Both were ultimately resolved diplomatically, to an extent; the Good Friday Agreement and the eventual Malayan Declaration of Independence. The Malayan Emergency is a good example because the British employed tactics not terribly dissimilar from what Russia seems to be employing. So if Russia can successfully defeat conventional Ukrainian forces and begin an occupation phase, then they're looking at a troop commitment somewhere in the vicinity of a million men. That's *after* casualties sustained. And right now Russia is bleeding a fairly significant number of forces accomplishing nothing. A meaningful breakthrough would be very costly to them, I think. And they'd have to maintain that figure through the inevitably bloody resistance movement. 

So they *could* probably hold Ukraine. *If* they defeated the conventional forces (looking increasingly unlikely), *if* they start learning from past mistakes (still unlikely), *if* they find local agents with credibility to work with (fat chance), *if* Putin's willing to commit to a decade+ occupation (probably the most likely thing here; fortunately, he won't live that long). 

Putin has made the same mistake Peter II made: he's tied himself and his reputation to the outcome of this war. For him, it's quite literally victory or death.

[],False,,Execution_Version,,,,,,"The premise that you're operating on seems to be that the strength of sanctions in response to a revisionist act correlates to the threat that the revisionist act to the ""international order"". 

I'm not convinced that this is true. I think you can boil it down to a more fundamental security analysis.

The sanctions on Russia can be characterised as a matter of power politics. Russia's invasion was a sharp lesson that Russia's conduct is not compatible the existing security order in Europe. NATO's concern at this point is that the Baltics and Poland (but the Baltics especially) are equally as susceptible, if not more susceptible, as Ukraine was the grey zone tactics that Russia has been using in Ukraine. Given the much higher risk of escalation in the Baltics, this is not a threat that NATO is willing to countenance. They have imposed terrifically high costs on Russia for this behaviour (possibly exacerbated by genuine feelings of shock and outrage), and they will seek to turn Ukraine into a bloody quagmire so that Russia's nationalist ambitions end there.

If China invades Taiwan, the strength of sanctions against it will also be a function of power politics. Taiwan is functionally more important to the US than Ukraine because the US has effectively given it a security guarantee. This is not a formal guarantee, but it is clear enough that any failure to act on it would seriously undermine the US position in Asia (far more than the botched withdraw from Afghanistan did, if that did at all). Notwithstanding the obligation inherent in the guarantee itself, there are all sorts of policy concerns that come to the fore then - the risk of nuclear proliferation with Japan and South Korea adopting nuclear postures (and Japan re-arming more generally), the loss of influence in Asia and the ability to shape informal economic and political coalitions against China, and ultimately giving China a clear path to emerge as a proper peer competitor. In European security terms, an invasion of Taiwan is closer to an invasion of the Baltics than it is an invasion of Ukraine.

The upshot of this is that the US response to an invasion of Taiwan should rationally be stronger than the US response to the invasion of Ukraine. We've already seen decoupling of strategic industries taking place over the last 5-6 years. The mood in Washington has turned exceptionally hawkish on China - policymakers are spending an awful lot of time talking about George Kennan and Dean Acheson. A full policy of containment seems to be off the table, but if China invades Taiwan then it is not inconceivable that it would split the world in two - US pressure on its allies could be such that they would essentially have to choose between engaging with China and engaging with the US. This is even before taking into account the risk of an actual military conflict between the two states.

I suspect that the Chinese do know this and that any measures that they take against Taiwan will be calculated to fall below the threshold of an American red line. We could see them occupy remote islands around Taiwan, or even assert control over Taiwan's airspace. But I don't expect an invasion in the foreseeable future.",60d3bcb7e56a7c34ad8d68cd34f30e296a1b1b4c,True,False,,,,,0,1647923295,,0,{},i1mh0yf,False,t3_th3faj,False,True,t1_i1m9unm,/r/geopolitics/comments/th3faj/theoretical_sanctions_on_china_for_invading_taiwan/i1mh0yf/,1647923310,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647894495.0,[],text,t2_6xdh5o5d,False,False

I do think the demographic takeover remains the safest best, short of economic stagnation necessitating a show of force to rally nationalism. Taiwan has the lowest fertility rate in the world &amp; a fairly efficient workforce already. Moving up the supply chain in what it already produces puts it in competition with Apple, Samsung, or increasing automated Japanese parts manufacturing. It's possible, but quite a challenge.

&gt; There are many reasons Putin decided to invade Ukraine, which historians and other experts will be sussing out for years. But it seems clear that the Russian leader pines for a time when his country — the heart of the late, not-so-great Soviet Union — was one of the most powerful on Earth. He has openly lamented its Cold War loss for years, and once famously pronounced the USSR's demise as ""the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century."" If nothing else, a quick military victory in Ukraine would prove that Russia is still a fearsome power.

&gt; That's not working out so great. 

&gt; While Russian bombs and missiles continue to rain down on Ukraine's cities, inflicting a terrible slaughter on the civilians there, the fact is that we're nearly a month into an invasion that many observers expected to take just a few days at most. The war appears to be stalemated, and Russia is suffering the consequences. Its economy has been shattered by Western sanctions and probably won't recover for a very long time, and reports suggest that tens of thousands of young professionals are fleeing the country to work and live elsewhere, depriving it of crucial intellectual capital. Perhaps worst of all from Putin's standpoint, Russia's military has been revealed to be something of a paper tiger, scarier in theory than in practice.

&gt; Instead of reasserting Russia's greatness, then, it looks very likely that Putin has actually hastened his country's decline — both as a place for its citizens to live, and as a player on the world stage. ""Russia is now, for the foreseeable future and as long as Putin is president, washed up as a world power,"" The Atlantic's Tom Nichols wrote last week on Twitter. 

&gt; It's easy to engage in a bit of schadenfreude here. But maybe we should read this moment as a cautionary tale — particularly for the United States, another great power afflicted with spasms of nostalgia for a better time and a tendency to throw around the weight of its mighty military: Lashing out in the name of greatness is a good way to actually reduce your standing in the world.

Can Western sanctions really change Russia’s behaviour? | The Bottom Line
&gt; In response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and Europe launched a barrage of sanctions barring Russia from accessing its hundreds of billions of dollars of reserves worldwide.  
But sanctions have been imposed on other countries for decades - North Korea, Cuba, Iran, Venezuela, among others - without much change in course for those governments.
