[],False,,DuckTwoRoll,,,[],,,,text,t2_1euk4478,False,False,"I mean, Russia has lost a minimum of +2 divisions of combat power. This isn't the death of the RuAF by any stretch, but it is a significant amount of losses in a relatively short amount of time. This rate of casualties is not sustainable. The Ukrainians are also likely losing combat power at an unsustainable rate, but *from what evidence I have seen* Russia is losing combat power at a faster rate than Ukraine is. This is mostly due to Ukraine being supported by Western powers and full internal mobilization, while Russia has not entered a ""total war"" stance.


Onto equipment:
Say what you will about Iraq in GW1, but they had a large and well equipped military for the time. Most of their tanks may have been T55/T62s but they also had a significant amount of T-72s. And T72s in 1991 were more modern than T-64BVs are in 2022. It's not like the US wasn't driving around in fucking M60s either.

This isn't to say that the RuAF are a paper tiger, but rather to illustrate that their on-paper capabilities are not matching their real-world performance. The ratio between this being due to operational (really, political) employment, lack of tactical prowess, or lack of equipment capability is up for debate. We know for certain that horrendous opening strategies have been a massive cause of this, but they are not the only cause. 

For the last point: Russia did not commit sufficient resources to accomplish its initial political objectives. Whether this is because it was unwilling or unable is the crux of the argument. I think Michael Kofman has been almost a prophet for how this has played out so far, and as he says ""has the war entered a stalemate? Yes and no. Russian forces may make slow, incremental advances in the Donbas. I suspect UKR military can hold on most fronts and perhaps even counter attack on others. However, attrition is undoubtedly taking its toll on both sides. ""

Each decoy would be given a slightly different RCS/IR signature that is similar to the actual warhead. So if you find out the IR/RCS signature of a single decoy you don't find anything of value.(all of them land pretty much destroyed/deformed too).

&gt;But if you were able to get a bunch of decoys and dud warheads and dissect both,

I believe this is necessary. If you don't know the real RCS and IR it would make discrimination far more difficult. But warheads will always explode and if not then severely deform. They impact very fast especially in the Iskander range missiles. But this is easily defeated by the idea behind the signature diversity of adding artificial variances to the decoys. Instead of aiming for an exact replica of the warhead. 

The Union of Concerned Scientists has a countermeasures report in which they highlight just how difficult discrimination actually is.

https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/countermeasures

&gt; A potential attacker considering the use of replica decoys may be concerned that the defense will be able to identify and exploit some small observable difference between the warhead and the decoys. One way to address this issue would be to modify the decoy strategy to exploit the fact that while the defense might know the general char-acteristics of the warhead, it would not know the exact characteristics. Thus, rather than trying to exactly rep-licate the warhead, the decoys would be made to have slightly different signatures from the warhead and from each other. This would prevent the defense from pick-ing out the warhead as the one object that was different from the rest.
For example, the attacker could use cone-shaped decoys with the same shape as the nuclear warhead, but of slightly varying lengths and nose radii of curva-ture. Such decoys would have slightly different radar cross sections from the warhead and each other.

&gt; The attacker could also diversify the infrared sig-nature of the decoys by using small heaters",312032f01b23efd3b2caf2b82b8881891226dcb6,True,False,,,,,0,1647992518,,0,{},i1q9tla,False,t3_tk2ex2,False,True,t1_i1q76t7,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tk2ex2/ukraine_megathread_march_22/i1q9tla/,1647992531,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647963718.0,

[],False,,June1994,,,[],,,,text,t2_fgez9,False,True,"&gt;I think people underestimate just how much the Russian Military is NOT currently prepared for this types of conflict since the fall of the USSR.

Comments like this just make me realize how often posters just do not engage with the posted material, or the scope of the conversation. They treat every tangentially related thread as a potential soapbox for their own (often unrelated) arguments. 

&gt;Lets assume Russia's nuclear program takes half as much money as the US's nuclear program, despite Russia fielding newer launch vehicles in a greater number. The US spends roughly 60 billion a year on average, so Russia spending 30 billion is not all that unlikely.

&gt;Now Russia's budget is down to 60 billion a year. Factor in their naval and submarine upgrades, likely running at least 10 to 15 billion per year and they are down to 45 billion dollars that could have possibly helped them in this conflict.

Your $60 billion dollars a year figure comes from [here](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57240#:~:text=CBO%20estimates%20that%20tactical%20nuclear,the%202018%20Nuclear%20Posture%20Review.). 2/3 of those costs are swallowed up by Ballistic Submarines and ICBMs. Russia's Navy's flagships are also SSBNs and swallow up a considerable portion of the Navy's budget. 

In other words, you conflate a lot of different spending in the $60 billion total for U.S. Nuclear Forces, yet you present Russian spending a la carte. Your math is bad by even napkin-math standards. 

&gt;Now factor in their T-14 and SU-57 which are likely multi billion dollar a year programs that haven't yielded a benefit on the ground. Factor in that Russia spends a huge amount of money on an internal defense force that is used to quell uprisings but isn't properly equipped to fight a war. (Think halfway between the US National Guard and US Police).

Between 2010-2017, Russia acquired 3,000 new combat vehicles, over 400 new aircraft, 16 regiments of S-400, 10 Iskander-M sets, and rebuilt a satellite network for GLONASS. Not to mention the dozens of new corvettes, a dozen new frigates, and a several brand-new SSBNs.

Russia spent a lot of money on lots of things, and they could afford to do so because,

1. They've run huge surpluses by running a pragmatic and clever fiscal policy. 
2. Their defense sector is almost entirely self-sufficient. This dramatically lowers their defense costs compared to other militaries who spend similar amounts of money, like Saudi Arabia. 

&gt;Very quickly you realize that Russia's military is not financed for a proper ground invasion. That is why we have the invasion force missing:

&gt;Standard optics
&gt;Night optics
&gt;Encrypted short range communications
&gt;Encrypted long range communications
&gt;Tires that aren't dry rotted
&gt;Continuous inflation system maintenance
&gt;High enough flight cadence for SEAD / Air superiority
&gt;Russia likely would have been in better shape fielding HALF the tanks but in an operational level of maintenance and upgrades.

This is a US-centric mindset. Militaries have accomplished more with less, again and again. This is due to our technology fetishism and chauvinism when it comes to the tactical level of operations. The very thread and research paper you are replying to, says the following;

**""For example, the Wehrmacht of  Nazi  Germany generally had  far beer tac-cs  than  Soviet  forces  (especially  at  the  beginning of the war), but the Soviets did not defeat Nazi Germany because of beer taccs. The Soviets defeated the Nazis because of beer operaonal art. Rough comparisons can be made be-tween Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, and the United States/NATO and Russian Federaon if engaged  in conict today.  The  United  States  military  prides  itself  on  taccal prociency,  but  success  against  the  Russian  military  dur-ing large-scale combat  operaons will require  not only an understanding of  Russian  taccs  but  also a  knowledge of Russian operaonal art. This is because a successful Russian outcome  against  the  United  States/NATO  in  armed  con-ict will likely be due to the acumen of Russian operaonal planners as much as the taccal prociency and tenacity of Russian commanders in the eld""**

Russian Armed Forces suffered, and continue to suffer numerous tactical defeats because their operational planning for Ukraine was absolutely delusional. A fact that a number of Western analysts have observed. 

The Russian Army has changed tactics and is quickly shifting gears. We can all point and laugh at how Russia is having to ""resort"" to Grozny-style tactics because they suck at urban warfare. Hate to break it to people, but a successful Russian approach doesn't fall back to such destructive strategy, it relies on it, because it's effective. 

While it is obvious that the Russian military is incapable of achieving the political victories it sought at the beginning of this conflict, they are more than capable of reducing their losses and achieving sound military victories on the battlefield. We underestimate our potential enemy, at our own peril. 

&gt;I think from a financial standpoint it is clear they haven't invested the resources to take on a large, decently equipped country.

There were two airborne assault at least, one in Hostomel and another attempt that led to at least one Ilyushin plane getting shot down at the airport of Vasylkiv

Destroying air defence shouldn't be hard when you're supposedly second military power in the world. You cite Serbia (dont know much about that war), but more recently the US in Irak started their invasion with days of SEAD missions and successfully destroyed air defences, so it isn't impossible, just need good equipement, good training, good planning.

The losses are indeed hard to quantify, but if you see the amount of proven to be destroyed material (there are website that track only those seen clearly on photos), and don't think that thousands of deaths is a realistic assessment, I don't know what to say...

Putin can indeed call in volonteers (or mobilize all the troops), but like ukrainian volonteers they will need time to be trained to a decent standard. They'll also need equipement that Russia seem to be short on (Radio food and fuel mainly, they have enough AK and shitty tanks for sure).

Chechen losses can't be counted with certainty ofc, but Kadyrov himself (in the Moscow Times) admitted to losses though of course very few (but even admitting it means a lot for those ""strongmen""). Also plenty of photos and videos of dead Kadyrovites.

The russian generals deaths (Generals, not colonels) are unlikely to be a straight up lie because a simple photo of the guy would suffice to show everyone the truth. Ofc Russia isn't going to admit to them, but when the US intel that was aware of the invasion before most of the russian staff was confirms it, idk i believe them more than russians atm

“Effective U.S. deterrence of Russian nuclear attack and non-nuclear strategic attack now requires ensuring that the Russian leadership does not miscalculate regarding the consequences of limited nuclear first use, either regionally or against the United States itself. Russia must instead understand that nuclear first-use, however limited, will fail to achieve its objectives, fundamentally alter the nature of a conflict, and trigger incalculable and intolerable costs for Moscow. Our strategy will ensure Russia understands that any use of nuclear weapons, however limited, is unacceptable.
The U.S. deterrent tailored to Russia, therefore, will be capable of holding at risk, under all conditions, what Russia’s leadership most values. It will pose insurmountable difficulties to any Russian strategy of aggression against the United States, its allies, or partners and ensure the credible prospect of unacceptably dire costs to the Russian leadership if it were to choose aggression.”

A couple of points are worth mentioning:

1- nuclear first use should never allow Russia to achieve an advantage

[],False,,fourthie,,,[],,,,text,t2_32f0o,False,False,"Strong disagree. Despite all the rhetoric and propaganda, there is still a world where NATO accepts a Russian-controlled Ukraine. It would be very painful for Russia, likely having to battle on the ground resistance for years. That doesn’t make it impossible though.


NATO has repeatedly stated they will not intervene directly in this invasion. I don’t see why that would be changed by the use of a “tactical” nuclear weapon. In fact, I believe it would be a strong signal from Russia that they are willing to sacrifice more in order to achieve a Russia-controlled Ukraine. 


I don’t understand how anyone thinks that NATO would respond by direction intervention or even a nuclear response. If Russia continues to escalate, NATO will simply back off and concede Ukraine. It will be awkward to look Zelensky in the eye, but ultimately there’s no willingness to get NATO troops involved (except for perhaps Poland). 


I’m more convinced than ever that the endgame for this war is Russia using a tactical nuke. I’m aware that many will find this viewpoint sensationalist, but it’s looking like a more attractive move for Russia every day. What will they do at day 200 of this war? With mounting coffins of Russian soldiers returning home, it will be tempting to force a surrender. 


One tactical nuclear strike on a remote Ukrainian training base would pause the resistance. There would be enough confusion and chaos amongst NATO members that we would likely pause arms shipments to prevent any further escalation or strikes. EU countries would focus on the fallout (in reality not a real problem, but would still lead to much public anxiety).


P.S. - I want to make it clear, what I’m describing is an abhorrent outcome. It’s important to keep a balanced view during these times, especially for strategic reasons. We should consider the options that Russia has to end the invasion.

For broadly the same reasons that Bismarck didn't attempt to annex the Austrian Empire after the Battle of Königgrätz. It would have been too much to swallow and digest in a single bite, and would have fundamentally changed the nature of the two states. The West was dealing with the challenges of accommodating the likes of Estonia and Hungary into the EU and NATO at the time, and trying to accommodate Russia - a vast country with its own non-aligned foreign policy, a dysfunctional economy, a highly corrupt political system - would have been an impossible endeavour.

If Yeltsin's successor had been, instead of Putin, an anti-corruption liberal who sought deeper integration and alignment with the West, it's possible that Russia would have been able to be integrated by the early 2010s.

Even if a carrier gave you, hypothetically, only 10% more value per cost, you would still choose to build them over the battleships, but that doesn't mean the battleship was mostly useless. And battleships still maintained some advantages over carriers: for example, in terms of survivability which meant you could park it in an unfriendly port and not have to worry too much, whereas a carrier is fragile and has to be escorted and kept safe. There was also the phycological element to the shore bombardment (of course, used as part of a combined arms operation).

[],False,,ProfessorDowellsHead,,,[],,,,text,t2_hxfc4,False,False,"&gt; what do the Russians need to capture in order to effectively encircle the JFO?

It's hard to tell exactly with the fog of war - if Ukraine forces are currently pulling out of the bulge then you'd be right that Russia would have to go fast and far to the west to close off the route. As of a few days ago, however, a significant encirclement could take place without going nearly as far as Pavlohrad. Snapping southward from Izyum and north from Donetsk, if Russia took Sloviansk/Kramatorsk, and then either Bahmut or Kostiantynivka it could have cut off most of the troops on the Luhansk/Donetsk front. With Russia reporting that it took Verkhniotoretske 3 hours ago, that may well have been the plan.

&gt; What are the latest news from Izium? Is it as significant as it looks on the wiki map? I.e., providing major road access to Donbass.

Supposedly the Russian offensive was stopped just outside the M-03/P-79 junction, at least for now. That is significant. If the junction was taken, that's a straight line on relatively good road to Sloviansk, and the kettle is almost shut. Reports that it wasn't, along with major movement of Ukrainian troops, leads me to think that Ukraine is right now pulling back to avoid encirclement, having managed successful fighting retreats previously in the southern theater. 

In the short term, the Russian failure to capture all of Izyum has given Ukraine a chance to retreat its veteran forces and reestablish defensive lines closer to the Dnieper. In the medium to long term, Russian near-capture of Izyum (and likely eventual full capture) will allow it to occupy most of the remains of the Donbass. However, there's not much of immediate value there outside coal as many people fled long ago. That angle of things isn't likely to significantly affect the war beyond allowing Ukraine to concentrate its forces on a smaller line of contact. The next fight there is likely going to be Dnipro/Zaporizhie on the left bank and Kriviy Rih on the right bank of the Dnieper - if the Russians are able to gain real control over all those crossings across the river (I think the majority of them are in those first two cities) things will get hairy, if they're stopped that should be that front (with possible push toward Odessa coming if Russia can't progress north).

What Russia *does* gain from capturing Izyum (once it does so completely) is the potential to strike west and either encircle Kharkiv through Nova Vodolaha or strike toward Poltava. Ukraine couldn't let Kharkiv get cut off in the way Mariuopol' did. 

Taking all of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts doesn't really change the strategic course of the war unless there are significant encirclements, it just moves the strategy to it's next phase. It's been clear for a while that Ukrainian strategy would be to fall back to defend the urban centers on the Dnieper crossings if pushed out of the Donbass. Likewise it's been clear that the plan is for Kharkiv to eat up Russian troops in urban combat or serve as a bulwark in the east. Over the last week Russia redeployed away from Kharkiv, negating Ukraine's advantages there. But the problem of pushing through urban centers remains if Russia is going to progress the war out of the Donbass into potentially decisive areas. If Russia successfully and quickly strikes west out of Izyum toward Poltava it could end up upending the current Ukrainian strategy. If Ukraine manages to redeploy in time and stop that thrust, however, it should still be ok.",03656f47e42ea39467f45a359ce980e002b0c0bb,True,False,,,,,0,1647980792,,0,{},i1ph5uk,False,t3_tk2ex2,False,False,t1_i1oq6vv,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tk2ex2/ukraine_megathread_march_22/i1ph5uk/,1647980808,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647951992.0,
[],False,,UltraRunningKid,,,[],,,,text,t2_takjt,False,False,"&gt;There are numerous studies of Russian operational art during World War II and the Cold War, but relatively little has been written on the topic since the collapse of the Soviet Union.

I think people underestimate just how much the Russian Military is NOT currently prepared for this types of conflict since the fall of the USSR. 

SIPRI puts Russia's annual military budget at 90 billion dollars give or take. 

Lets assume Russia's nuclear program takes half as much money as the US's nuclear program, despite Russia fielding newer launch vehicles in a greater number. The US spends roughly 60 billion a year on average, so Russia spending 30 billion is not all that unlikely. 

Now Russia's budget is down to 60 billion a year. Factor in their naval and submarine upgrades, likely running at least 10 to 15 billion per year and they are down to 45 billion dollars that could have possibly helped them in this conflict. Now factor in their T-14 and SU-57 which are likely multi billion dollar a year programs that haven't yielded a benefit on the ground. Factor in that Russia spends a huge amount of money on an internal defense force that is used to quell uprisings but isn't properly equipped to fight a war. (Think halfway between the US National Guard and US Police).

Very quickly you realize that Russia's military is not financed for a proper ground invasion. That is why we have the invasion force missing:

* Standard optics
* Night optics
* Encrypted short range communications
* Encrypted long range communications
* Tires that aren't dry rotted
* Continuous inflation system maintenance
* High enough flight cadence for SEAD / Air superiority


Russia likely would have been in better shape fielding HALF the tanks but in an operational level of maintenance and upgrades.

Russia's current military seems better equipped for a few things, namely: 

* Strategic nuclear deterrence
* Limited proxy fighting (like in Syria)
* Anti-civil uprising

There was an assumption that Russian operational (That is, at the operational level of war) capabilities were extremely robust. This assumption is founded on pretty sound logic, as outlined in the paper: The Russians heavily emphasize the operational level of war, so it makes sense to expect a strong operational understanding.

What has happened in reality is an operational failure. And I suspect it is related to the organization of military districts vs army groups. It appears that logistics was assumed to be offloaded to the military districts, and operational planners simply became blind to how dire the logistics situation was as a result.

Military districts in Russia are inexorably tied to local government and local requirements. This is an ideal environment for corruption, as military leaders in the military districts must develop relationships with local government. Corruption is a logistics nightmare.

Meanwhile, operational planners in the general staff were either:


Overlooked, and did not actually prepare any serious operational plans for Ukraine.

[],False,,Doglatine,,,[],,,,text,t2_a8hrp,False,False,"&gt;His fundamental argument is that the West should have avoided antagonizing Russia because the West would be better off partnering with Russia to...contain China.

I've heard this argument from a lot of people and I don't find it at all persuasive. Both China and especially Russia are [revisionist states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revisionist_state), whose geopolitical ambitions are aligned in weakening the [liberal international order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_international_order). The West simply cannot give Russia what it wants, insofar as that would mean the vassalisation and annexation of multiple West-aligned sovereign states (Ukraine, Moldova, the Baltics) and a sphere of influence over much of Eastern Europe. It also can't really give China what it wants in the form of Taiwan, but there's at least room for diplomatic compromise there (e.g., the US's [One China policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-China_policy), or multiparty talks concerning EEZs in the South China Sea), and China in general seems a more pragmatic and predictable international actor.

Consequently, idea that we could somehow 'pry' Russia from China given their mutual shared underlying interests always struck me as folly. And honestly, the best hope of pulling that off (remote though it still seems) would be to hope for a regime change in Russia that allowed it to be brought into the Liberal International Order, with a ruling elite whose position was dependent on Western patronage. Maybe then we could split the two apart, but we won't get there by paying the Danegeld to Putin.

&gt;Oh, because you think we've been the winning the bets so far. Okay. I hope it stays that way.  


Calling them ""bets"" rather than, e.g., ""predictions"" isn't giving enough credit to the many thinkers who've taken the opposite line from Mearsheimer, and claimed that the West's interests are served by standing up for democratic  self-determination in Europe and the wider world.

Moreover, while there remains at least one loss-state for the West and the wider world, namely nuclear war, it still seems very unlikely. Moreover, at this point, I don't see a clear pathway to victory for Russia. Russia does not have the military capacity to win the war decisively, nor the state capacity to finance a prolonged occupation of its existing territorial holdings. Come what may, Ukraine will continue to exist, independent and democratic and West-aligned.

I don't know about that. The weaker power as a whole? Yes, absolutely - but when talking about the Eastern European theatre? I'm not so sure.

I think a lot of both Western and Russian planners and analysts expected Russia to have a local advantage until significant amounts of US materiel and personnel could be shipped over. I don't think there was the same sort of fear that the Russian army could sweep over Europe up until the Portuguese coastline like there was in the early Cold War - but there was definitely a fear that Russia's immediate border regions (especially the Baltics and Poland) would probably have to be retaken rather than defended.

Obviously Article 5 and the US nuclear umbrella perhaps meant those fears were less pressing, but I don't think there was an expectation that Russia's immediate NATO neighbours + whatever US forces were in theatre + whatever immediately deployable forces the UK, France, and Germany could muster, would actually be able to do much more than delay the Russians until the bulk of US, British, and French troops could be mobilised and deployed.

Those kinds of predictions assumed a few things, some which turned out not to be true, and some which just turned out not to apply to *this* operation. There's also usually a lopsided incentive structure from top to bottom in which you err on the side of overestimating your opponents and underestimating your friends.

It was assumed that Russian equipment was in approximately working order. It seems like Russian leadership *also* assumed that. But there have clearly been issues with maintenance and readiness. To say nothing of the crippling lack of secure communications. I don't know whether the western IC was on top of that, specifically, though I suspect perhaps they were.

It was assumed that Russian forces had roughly enough sustainment to operate offensively for a couple of weeks before issues arose, that was Soviet doctrine and Russia (on paper) had stuck with it.

It was assumed that Ukrainian forces would perform much as they had in the past, that's always the safest bet. But in fact, 8 years of simmering conflict, less corruption in government and significantly increased national identity, a shedding of any ambiguity about what Russia was up to, and the miserable state of things under Russian backed gangs in Donbass all meant that this was a country ready to resist.

Western intelligence, training, advice, and weapons, have all proven extremely effective. That's something an analyst would hope for, but couldn't really *count* on beforehand.

Finally, in this case, the Russian side of things was simply botched. The invasion of Ukraine is a *huge* undertaking, but almost everyone was kept in the dark until they were ordered over the border. Presumably for deniability. With the hope being that a few early pushes would be enough for regime change and Putin could still claim that the huge buildup really was just an exercise. But doing things that way has absolutely undercut Russian morale. Usually, significant planning goes into how you're going to approach it, people are briefed and perhaps even specifically trained for their part in it, while things ramp up it's made clear to you what the aim is and why it's worth doing, probably (and frankly) it's also explained why these people are your enemy.

Without all that, Russia's initial weeks were half-hearted and disorganised. Stumbling from a doomed non-invasion, to an all-out invasion, to a stalled out stalemate, without any acknowledgement that's what was happening or (seemingly) any awareness of the big picture.

Also setting aside the uncertainty of what's literally going on inside Putin's brain, we can make some assumptions about what his objectives were.  Geopolitically, he wanted to demonstrate to the world that Russia is a global superpower, and so countries close to it do not deserve their own sovereignty; they should capitulate to its will, and nobody else should try to stop them.  Militarily, he wanted to move in and quickly take control of the population centers so that he could install his pro-Russia puppet regime.  These two objectives on midnight Feb 23 are pretty uncontroversial.

We can already say he has failed the geopolitical objective.  Some kind of miraculous reversal might be able to rebuild Russian military credibility from the ashes, but, Putin has demonstrated that Russia is a weak regional power with nukes, not a global superpower.

So we're left with the military objectives.  This is where it's gets muddy.  Yes, that original strategy failed.  There's no blitzkrieg to Paris for Putin in Ukraine.  But, in principle, he could still overcome Ukraine's defenses and take over the major population centers, with Kyiv as the keystone, and force regime change.  He is, it would seem, losing that fight.  Ukraine seems to be winning that fight.  Could they change objectives, settle for something lesser?  Sure.  It's a possibility.  It would be a compromise.  Arguably, it would be a lose-lose compromise, and I suspect the consensus would be that neither of them won the war at that point.  What's also possible, is that Ukraine continues to win on the tactical level, as it seems to have been quite a lot, and ultimately force Russia out of Ukraine, either politically or militarily.  Philosophy aside, I think we call that a military win for Ukraine and a military loss for Russia.

You can couch that in terms like ""achieving objectives"" or ""not achieving objectives"" but once we get to that language, how deep do you go?  Every KIA individual failed to achieve their tactical objective of surviving.  Do you do a body count?  Do you go back to initial strategic objectives?

&gt; The current discussion of Russian military activities is oriented either on strategic-level  matters, such as  nuclear weapons, information operations, and cyberspace war-fare, or on tactical-level matters, such as battalion tactical groups, brigades, and divisions. What is rarely discussed is how Russia bridges strategy to tactics, which happens at the operational level of war.1 Russia has a long history of study-ing operational art and with many great theorists. There are numerous studies  of Russian operational art during  World War II and the Cold War, but relatively little has been written on the topic since the collapse of the Soviet Union.

&gt; The mass warfare involving multiple echeloned armies and fronts that the Soviets anticipated during the Cold War will probably never occur. But this does not mean it is no longer necessary to study Russian operational art. It is unlikely that Russia intends to occupy any North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) nation or desires a military confrontation with the United States or NATO; but the author believes there are plenty of opportunities for an unintended armed conflict that could escalate to the level of large-scale combat operations. The Russian Federation is not the Soviet Union, and it has a substantially smaller military than the Soviets. The  army  and  front-level formations  that Soviet  operational  planners  war-gamed  no longer  exist,  so  understanding Russia’s current force structure for  the  conduct  of  large-scale combat operations involves a discussion  of its  army groups, Joint  Strategic  Commands,  the Russian General Staff, and other related topics.

Right now, Ukrainians are entrenched in cities, because urban fights will inflict high casualty on Russians trying to take them, thus giving Ukrainians some control over what happens.  Ukrainians have no counter to nuclear strikes on cities, and Russians will take no battle casualty. The goal of nuclear strikes would be to demonstrate to Ukrainians that resisting or refusing Russian terms is completely futile: either death or the terms (either way, Russians cannot made to pay).

As far as western response options go, they are:

1.  Direct military intervention.  I think this will quickly escalate to nuclear exchange.  Since Russian army is at disadvantage against NATO in conventional warfare, Russia would prefer to go directly to nuclear brinksmanship, where the game will be more even.  My guess is that Russia may launch a small strike at NATO forces gathering to intervene?  It will go from there.  Hopefully after a few cities are destroyed, both sides will call it quit.  I would consider this NATO’s loss, since they are wealthier and more populous, they would lose more than Russia for every bomb dropped.

2.  Limited nuclear strike.  Question is where does NATO strike?  In Ukraine or in Russian territory?  My guess is that NATO would strike in Ukraine, where Russians army is gathered.  Russia would probably retaliate by striking military targets in Poland and Baltic states.  NATO would probably then strike Kaliningrad, since strike from there will hit with no warning.  As with #1, it will escalate from there.  Again, I would consider this NATO’s loss.

3.  No nuclear retaliation, but forward deployment of nukes in Poland and Baltics.  I strongly doubt US/EU would risk their way of life and wealth for a country they are not obligated to protect.  However, parking many short range nukes near Russia will essentially give NATO a first strike capability that Putin cannot match, and robs him of any strategic maneuverability.  Also, non-proliferation is dead - every nation will want nukes and there will be stopping them.

1) Force more conscripts undergoing mandatory service to sign contracts (there's scheduled to be another biannual round of conscription this spring)
2) Pull more reservists (i.e. those who have done mandatory service, but were not active for some time)
3) Full-on mobilization of all able males

My opinion is that unless Russia is ready to spend months training them (and who the hell would do that?), they are just going to be useless. The institute of mandatory service has been rotten to the core for quite some time now, and I'd argue does not produce effective soldiers at the end of the year (contract soldiers actually do training before deployments e.g. to syria). There's quite a few jokes in Russia that revolve around ""who in their sound mind would trust a conscript with an actual gun?"". In most units most of the time in the mandatory year of service is spent on learning the military rules, cleaning and cooking duties, marching, and, in extreme cases, being unpaid labor for the construction of generals' dachas.

We've already seen glimpses of that in POW reports. For 1), against Putin's promises, there actually were 18yo conscripts at the front (because mid level command never expected an actual war and covered their corruption so), some of them having never shot a rifle before. For 3), an actual full-on mobilization has been in effect for some time now in DNR and LNR (so a low proportion of the whole force), where able bodied males are grabbed from the street and transferred to the front. They say themselves that with zero combat effectiveness they suspect they are being used by the actual Russian soldiers for the discovery of Ukrainian positions.

I think Putin does not declare a mobilization simply because it would not help much, while hurting him in a few other areas.

That was basically an insurgency for most of it.  I didn't think I needed to explain why Ukrainian insurgency is not going to be intense as those of the Afghans, but I did so anyway 2 comments ago just in case.  (and I have to remind you that despite that historically ferocious and western-funded insurgency it took then 10 years to win that)

Considering that basically the whole war was in the form of an insurgency, the high casualty rates experienced right now are not going to be representative of a post-invasion reality (that for a variety of reasons may not even transpire).  If we do transition into an occupied insurrection, I expect deaths/year to be comparable to afghanistan, if not less.

&gt;Your perception of the Ukrainian leadership's stance in negotiations is wildly different than mine.

Finally something we can agree on.

&gt;As far as I can tell the ONLY think the Ukrainians have agreed to compromise on is their NATO status and that's it. I know a lot of reporting has been thrown around about their negotiations and I also know that they themselves pushed back on the reporting that said they were ""halfway"" to any sort of serious agreement.

I'm not aware of them walking back the ""halfway"" quote, but they admittedly do talk a whole lot, so I could have missed it.  Either way, their rhetoric is very inviting to negotiation (and have been since basically day 2) - Russia has just thus far refused to be realistic.  As you've said, clearly you have a perception that Ukraine is not committed to peace talks yet.  I do not share that perception, as you have also said, but I must add that I have decent cause to think that, as I have described.

&gt;Existing as sovereign state is beneficial to Ukraine.

Sure, which is why they didn't surrender.  But that benefit isn't absolute, which is why if it comes down to it (it probably won't), Ukraine won't die to the last man over it.  Their threshold is somewhere between 0 and 100.  If the war switches over from defending territory to a stalemate, the suffering incurred by their citizens is going to get more compelling over time.  Russia is ultimately fine continuing to trade Russian soldiers for Ukrainian civilians - Ukraine is less happy about that trade.

&gt;If they lose a bunch of important territory, like their coast as you noted, their future sovereignty becomes jeopardized so how is NOT fighting particularly beneficial to Ukraine?

If recapturing that territory is impossible, the only form of ""fighting"" remaining is to just exchange shells with the occupiers, where both sides are ultimately shelling Ukrainian civilians in Ukrainian cities.  I have described twice now why that isn't beneficial, I'm gonna pass on #3.

&gt;Furthermore it doesn't matter whether YOU think its beneficial to them or not, it matters what THEY think.

A fundamental premise of both economics and politics is that there are some common goals and incentives a human in a situation can be expected to have.  ""minimizing the suffering of your own civilians"" qualifies as one of those things.  Like, people are talking about a 10 year war.  Look at how much suffering has happened in just 1 month.  You're really that sure Ukraine's leadership is willing (or even able) to stomach **years** of that?

&gt;a possibility of additional insurrection in the cities they have captured at the pleasure of the people living in them.

Ok so we are at least theoretically suggesting insurrection/insurgency - then what I've mentioned regarding that applies.

&gt;(russian public perception) I really don't think you should be as confident about that as you are but there's no way to prove or disprove the claim as it stands.

I'm not gonna pretend there's not a subjective element to my claim here but I do have personal insight into the modern Russian public that I think is at odds with western perceptions of how they're taking/going to take this - that I think is the important thing I'm trying to convey, the actual takeaway from that perception is obviously subjective.

&gt;Probably because he's going to cost them a lot of fucking money, tbh.

Well, if you're talking about the financial oligarchs, they have some implicit power (they used to have more), but several of them have basically publicly hinted they absolutely don't have a leash on Putin in this regard.  Which isn't shocking.  You know the scene in that one batman movie where some rich guy who financed Bane is like ""I'm in charge here, I gave you money"", and Bane is like ""and that gives you power over me?"".  I've probably failed the delivery but you get what I'm going for - yeah, the oligarchs enabled Putin's rise to power, but at this point their role is primarily advisory and economic.  

In this dynamic, holding the money is good, holding the gun is better.  Though putin also holds a lot of money - his wealth is estimated in the 12 digits.  That dwarfs the already ridiculous oligarchs, so it's not like Putin doesn't have economic power of his own.

&gt;Chechnya is much smaller, had one major city, had a much smaller population, and had an initial ""army"" of 20k dudes. Comparing Chechnya or Georgia to Ukraine is laughably ridiculous.

Well, I didn't compare Georgia (for the record that's not part of Russia yet anyway), but there were plenty of proud and large nations assimilated into the behemoth that is modern Russia.  Plus, you claimed a ""historical trend of imperialist aggressors occupying other nations but then eventually getting bored"", and I brought up those other nations as examples of the complete opposite.  In fact, most imperial occupations end in annexation, it's why empires existed and why the nations that are big are as big as they are.

Basically, I reject the notion that that trend as stated is particularly compelling - you've now added a ""large nation"" (in either size or army strength) rider (unrelated to anything, I find your Texas example pretty funny since Texas has literally been annexed twice) which again I wouldn't call a trend - plenty of places do get conquered.

&gt;I think we may already be getting some of those signals by watching the Russians run around desperately trying to find any mercenary they can scrounge up to throw into Ukraine.

Well that's the thing - I'm getting mixed messages from that.  It suggests they clearly want more troops, but they're not **that** desperate to have them yet, if they're just bringing in chucklefucks from Syria.  Like, there are other active duty russian soldiers not committed to this invasion yet (I've heard the argument that they can't leave their posts because they're protecting other borders, but like, come on, no one's invading Russia) and I think it's an open question as to why.  

My take is that they've realized they need more men, but are not yet convinced they need **many** more men.

Anyway, I think I've made my major points.  I understand you're not convinced, but there's a limit to how much it's reasonable for me to reiterate them and I am going to leave things as they are now.

Following the referendum in mid-April with a surprising 200% voter participation rate, the residents of these areas apparently decide to become independent states. Russian troops are withdrawn from the rest of Ukraine and stationed along the new border as a ""peacekeeping force"" to ""protect the new states"". Putin declares Mission Accomplished.

Putin offers to start sending the forcibly-displaced Ukrainians back to Ukraine to reunite families as long as a ceasefire can be maintained ""to make it safe to do so"". Western sanctions against Russia merely intensify throughout this chain of human rights violations. How does Ukraine respond?

My expectation is that they continue fighting. This is basically Russia repeating their one-sided offer that Ukraine has already rejected. The withdrawal of Russian forces from northern Ukraine somewhat frees up the Ukrainian mechanized infantry brigades to move south once western long-range anti-aircraft vehicles are delivered to them.

Occasional incursions or smuggling operations through Russian lines would be sufficient to deliver weapons and supplies (ideally IEDs and sniper rifles) to local resistance fighters, ensuring that Russians continue to face attrition and insecure supply lines. The occupied territories being heavily sanctioned would force Putin to divert economic resources to sustain them or face riots and growing resistance. Russia's economy would likely falter as sanctions mount, Europe decreases their reliance on Russian oil, and war expenses continue.

Without fossil fuel revenue (70% of their exports and 23% of their GDP), Russia might lose the ability to pay its troops, or may have to implement austerity measures and raise taxes. Either way, that would likely be enough strain to eventually cause the Russian government to collapse and Russian maintenance of the 'breakaway republics' to fail. Ukraine ends up reunited.

I'm honestly not sure how victory is even possible for Russia within the next 10-15 years unless Ukraine rolls over and lets them win. If Ukraine decides to keep fighting, Ukraine is almost certain to eventually retake all of its territory.",024febf3f93afde10a7030dff2d73f2ab279d4c8,True,False,,,,,0,1647965016,,0,{},i1oc63m,False,t3_tjqfpz,False,True,t1_i1n73lk,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tjqfpz/why_cant_the_west_admit_that_ukraine_is_winning/i1oc63m/,1647965034,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647936216.0,

Anyone who has been closely following the invasion has noticed that the Russians have been consistently advancing across all fronts. The article has a point that scholars are protective of their subject matter and admire the ""cerebral"" slant of Russian doctrine despite it being based on false assumptions, but there are strong grounds to doubt the media narrative around the war as well. OSINT loss trackers and Western/Ukrainian loss estimates would have us believe that the Russians have lost 2-3 times more men and equipment than the Ukrainians, but this is bizarre because in no war in the past century has a consistently advancing force lost much more than a consistently retreating one. The flow of prisoners, abandoned and captured equipment, abandoned wounded, and opportunistic encirclements always favors the side making progress. The Russians have moreover pulled off three large-scale encirclements since the start of the offensive: Mariupol, Sumy, and Cherniv. Encirclements almost always result in the destruction of a large force for comparatively little cost, and are certainly not a sign of ""losing"".

This paradox is possible only because Ukraine has decisively won the information war. Russia bans its forces from using social media and only a fraction of its kills are picked up by OSINT. Case in point - as of the time of this post, Oryx posted a picture of a [Russian tank being captured](https://postlmg.cc/tnsN0HVn) today. The last Ukrainian tank captured was [posted *8 days ago*](https://postlmg.cc/H8sFZ82v). This is in spite of the fact that the advancing side should be expecting to capture far more vehicles. Many Ukrainian claims of success have also been disproven. The most famous is probably the ""failed VDV attack"" on Hostomel airport. In this incident, Ukraine claimed to have cleared 200 VDV paratroopers from the airport outside Kiev. However, there is video evidence of them being in the airport the morning after Ukraine claimed to have expelled them. The Ukrainian army is also constantly claiming that it is launching this or that counteroffensive. Typically, these counteroffensives are ""successes"". Yet, almost none of them register on the situation map, which shows continuous Russian advances. 

Finally, the idea that the Russians are getting clobbered does not line up with force numbers and their progress. It's widely accepted that the Russians have deployed around 200,000 regulars, supplemented by tens of thousands of auxiliaries from Donetsk, Lugansk, and Chechnya among other places. The pre-war Ukrainian army consisted of 145,000 men. An additional 45,000 personnel were part of the air force and were almost certainly pressed into ground combat after the loss of the majority of their arm's equipment. A further 15,000 personnel made up the navy, a large part of whom were naval infantry. 102,000 soldiers existed in paramilitary organizations, and Ukraine had 900,000 reservists. Though only a fraction of the latter could be called up, it's clear that Ukraine had commanding numerical superiority even on the first day of the invasion.

The Soviet Afghan war killed 14.5k Russian troops and there is no reason to think that this war wont kill a similar number of Russians if it goes one for months more so idk where you're getting that from.

&gt;This ""his generals and advisors are about to kill him I promise"" theory is also pretty fanciful

Don't characterize my argument. They're obviously not ""about to kill him"" but being ""about to kill him"" isnt the only way for them to put pressure on him is my point. Putin has to not only contend with his people's discontent but the oligarchs discontent too. He's already apparently putting some of them in ""house arrest"" and if you half believe some of the stories that have hit the headlines the FSB aren't exactly 100% thrilled about how this is shaking out either. 

&gt;why would you propose someone in his inner circle would try to depose him?

Probably because he's going to cost them a lot of fucking money, tbh.

&gt;in practice I don't think it's fair to say Ukraine isn't seeking a cease fire.

I didn't say they weren't.

&gt; If anything, Ukranian leadership is signaling willingness to negotiate far more than the Russians, even going as far as saying stuff like ""oh we're halfway there on an agreement"" - not words that sound like they were said by someone consumed by bloodlust.

Your perception of the Ukrainian leadership's stance in negotiations is wildly different than mine. As far as I can tell the ONLY think the Ukrainians have agreed to compromise on is their NATO status and that's it. I know a lot of reporting has been thrown around about their negotiations and I also know that they themselves pushed back on the reporting that said they were ""halfway"" to any sort of serious agreement. All I have read after keeping track of this conflict for the past month is Ukrainian grumbling that the Russians are being unrealistic in their terms. They haven't softened on their territorial demands at all that I know of.

&gt; To be honest I assumed you were making that assumption, given that ""Cities of people who protest against their occupiers daily and are probably going to start shooting them soon"" sounds like it's alluding to precisely that.

While that WOULD be insurrection that's not what I was referring to. I was referring to a point in this war where the Russians occupy all of Ukraine and then have to contend with trying to occupy a country the size of Texas with 40 million people in it that completely dwarfs any of their latest military campaigns in Chechnya and Georgia. I am not certain at this point that the Russians will get that far and if they don't that means this war stays conventional and bloody with a possibility of additional insurrection in the cities they have captured at the pleasure of the people living in them.

&gt; nations that have bucked your ""trend"" at some point in history, some (like Chechnya)

See above. Chechnya is much smaller, had one major city, had a much smaller population, and had an initial ""army"" of 20k dudes. Comparing Chechnya or Georgia to Ukraine is laughably ridiculous.

Neither one of those countries, by the way, had the explicit backing of the west in terms of manpower, intelligence support, and materials. Chechnya and Georgia were not the proxy wars that Ukraine is turning into.

&gt; I've explained above why that's not particularly beneficial to Ukraine

Existing as sovereign state is beneficial to Ukraine. If they lose a bunch of important territory, like their coast as you noted, their future sovereignty becomes jeopardized so how is NOT fighting particularly beneficial to Ukraine?

Furthermore it doesn't matter whether YOU think its beneficial to them or not, it matters what THEY think. And as of this moment their position is ""no territorial concessions.""

&gt; So politically, the casualties are probably completely sustainable, as I've reiterated ad nauseam.

I really don't think you should be as confident about that as you are but there's no way to prove or disprove the claim as it stands. We'll just have to see what happens.

&gt;that could signal unsustainable casualties.

I think we may already be getting some of those signals by watching the Russians run around desperately trying to find any mercenary they can scrounge up to throw into Ukraine. But other than that I will agree with you on this point at least, its too early to tell.",e160b9ec55f82a4a4ab01415e3c5d1b6a1f79a37,True,False,,,,,0,1647961756,,0,{},i1o3x5p,False,t3_tjqfpz,False,True,t1_i1nz2lo,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tjqfpz/why_cant_the_west_admit_that_ukraine_is_winning/i1o3x5p/,1647961768,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647932956.0,

Of course, this could all be high stakes posturing to try and maximize gains in a negotiated settlement, but I feel such takes minimize the popularity of Putin's vision of the restoration of an imperial Russia really is.

Would such a mobilization actually help Russia in the current conflict? Long term the answer is obviously yes to some degree and if Putin hasn't revised his war aims it's pretty much a requirement at this point. The moral answer to ""is it worth it?"" is obviously no, but those aren't the terms in which Putin is thinking. It gets murky when the price of achieving those aims effectively nullifies any realpolitick gains from doing so, which seems to be the consensus. But even then if the goal is realizing an imperial vision of Russia, realpolitick may not apply.

In terms of how quickly Russia could mobilize and how effective those troops would be in the midst of severe sanctions I'll defer to others.

[],False,,hatesranged,,,[],,,,text,t2_3svjqav4,False,False,"&gt;It didn't take a revolution to get the Soviets out of Afghanistan, who says there needs to be one to get the Russians out of Ukraine?

It took economic collapse at home (which the west is hoping for but hasn't happened yet) and one of the fiercest insurgencies in human history - an insurgency you're kind of just assuming will happen in Ukraine, but is far from guaranteed to actually happen, for reasons I've discussed, and is definitely guaranteed to be far less brutal than that of the Afghans.

&gt;Speaking of which...Putin is not the god king of Russia, there are other powerful people in Russia who are probably right now discussing ways to implement replacing him if he doesn't ""save face"" which is something you seem to think he has no need to do.

This ""his generals and advisors are about to kill him I promise"" theory is also pretty fanciful - it seems like the only reason it's prominent is that it would make our lives a lot easier (which it admittedly would) with relatively little effort on our part.  

The bigger the problem the less you should rely on it resolving itself simply.  It's like hoping a political candidate you really dislike dies of some illness before the vote - if that's what you're relying on, you're in for a bad time.

If Putin is steadfast on continuing the war (which he is), and the public are with him (they are and will likely continue to be for a while), why would you propose someone in his inner circle would try to depose him?  Because he's a meanie?  That's our perception of him.

There's plenty of russian politicians and technical advisors that are publically advocating for and justifying this invasion, and that's their unironic viewpoint.  There's a large pool of Russian elites who genuinely believe the invasion is in Russia's political interests.  Do you really think Putin couldn't populate the Kremlin entirely or mostly with candidates from that pool?

&gt;If the Russians keep it. The Ukrainians know this and so far seem to be pretty uninterested in ceasing hostilities until the Russians leave as I said further up. Until that will to fight shows signs of evaporating there's not reason to believe the Ukrainians will stop fighting for their land back. While the war goes on they pretty much have all the economic backing they need from the rest of Europe.

Economic backing isn't going to un-kill their civilians and won't un-destroy their cities (until a cease fire is made).  As long as the war goes on, no matter how confident Ukraine is that they're winning, they have a fundamental incentive to seek an ending, as every bomb and shell that drops (and there's a lot of those) drops on Ukranian soil.

And that's just theoretical incentive - in practice I don't think it's fair to say Ukraine isn't seeking a cease fire.  They're not agreeing to the current terms, but we can't judge too much from that considering Russia has basically not given realistic terms yet.  If anything, Ukranian leadership is signaling willingness to negotiate far more than the Russians, even going as far as saying stuff like ""oh we're halfway there on an agreement"" - not words that sound like they were said by someone consumed by bloodlust.

&gt;Well at this point I'm not even assuming the war gets to the point of insurrection.

To be honest I assumed you were making that assumption, given that ""Cities of people who protest against their occupiers daily and are probably going to start shooting them soon"" sounds like it's alluding to precisely that.  It's why I bothered responding to that. 
 But if you're also not sure that insurrection will happen, sure, we can shelve that.

&gt;Unless for some reason this war manages to buck the long established historical trend of an imperialist aggressor trying to invade and occupy a place and then losing the political will to do so after months or years of pointless struggle.

...Look at Russia on the map.  90% of that comically vast territory consists of nations that have bucked your ""trend"" at some point in history, some (like Chechnya) recently. 

&gt;There is no reason to believe as long as Ukraine has an army that it will stop fighting.

But... fighting where?  So far Ukraine's main focus has been defending land (especially city centers), supplemented by small village-level counterattacks.  That's the fight they're fighting.  If Russia at some point says ""aight, the land I've grabbed sates me, I'm digging in, eat shit"", to keep fighting Ukraine would have to shift focus away from defense, to one of two options - 

Advance deep into Russian held territory - not happening.  That whole ""if the Russians keep it"" - not an if.  It would be suicide to even try and I sincerely hope Ukrainian commanders keep that in mind.  I'm honestly really worried some commander somewhere gets overconfident because they've succeeded on defense and then loses his troops trying to advance into Russian artillery.

Also dig in and play artillery tennis - I've explained above why that's not particularly beneficial to Ukraine, given Ukraine's side of the court is full of Ukrainian buildings and Russia's side of the court is... also full of Ukrainian buildings.

&gt;We are looking at a war that could have killed just as many Russian soldiers in 26 days.

Sure.  The russian people didn't give a shit about those wars (and that first one was disastrous - the Russian people actively loved it tho).  If this war has double the casualties, they won't give two shits instead.

This is before we consider that the Russian public now is a lot less liberal and a lot more hawkish than it was during the early perestroika.  

So politically, the casualties are probably completely sustainable, as I've reiterated ad nauseam.

Tactically?  

That's less certain, but clearly despite tanking these casualties they've managed to take strategically important land and are still parked within 15 km of Zelensky's house, so thus far they have been acceptable to strategic command.  If we start seeing Russians actively withdrawing from entrenched positions (either in the North or South), that could signal unsustainable casualties.  But we're not there yet, unfortunately, so sustainability discussions are pretty theoretical for now.",369f237e2ae2b2c739bab0ea810d4a5ddee600c2,True,False,,,,,0,1647959780,,0,{},i1nz2lo,False,t3_tjqfpz,False,True,t1_i1ntntv,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tjqfpz/why_cant_the_west_admit_that_ukraine_is_winning/i1nz2lo/,1647959798,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647930980.0,

[],False,,Doglatine,,,[],,,,text,t2_a8hrp,False,False,"I can understand a *moral* argument that the West should have avoided 'antagonising' Russia, so as to avoid catastrophic consequences for the Ukrainian people. I don't find it particularly compelling, though, because the stakes for Ukraine of remaining in Russia's orbit (and outside the EU) are similarly vast, and it's not irrational for Ukrainians to prefer short-term catastrophe to long-term stagnation. 

But Mearsheimer's argument isn't a moral one; he's very clear about this, saying e.g. -

&gt;One also hears the claim that Ukraine has the right to determine whom it wants to ally with and the Russians have no right to prevent Kiev from joining the West. This is a dangerous way for Ukraine to think about its foreign policy choices. The sad truth is that might often makes right when great-power politics are at play. Abstract rights  such as self-determination are largely meaningless when powerful states get into brawls with weaker states.

So what exactly is his argument? What's the methodology? What are the norms he's appealing to? Having read quite a lot of few of his papers on this, I think he dithers between a strict Realist approach that appeals to brute self-interest of states, and a more old-fashioned moralising one, in which states have more or less *legitimate* interests that ought to be mutually respected (e.g. Russia's concern about Western influence in its backyard).

Once we strip away the oddly moralising language, though, he seems to be committed to a view that the West will itself be worse off thanks to having supported Ukraine, and that's where I think his analysis is not faring well in the light of actual events. So far, the West is reaping considerable geopolitical dividends from the war in the Ukraine, both internally in strengthening the bonds of its alliances and their economic and political cohesion, and externally, in the humiliation of Russia, the deterrence of China, and the permanent shifting of Ukrainian sentiments into the Western camp. It's even conceivable that the war may result in regime change in Moscow to the West's long-term advantage (unlikely, but far less so than 6 months ago). Insofar as we've made a self-interested geopolitical bet in supporting Ukraine's aspirations towards EU and NATO membership, we've been winning the bets so far.",5f57934830f47ce4481cf1b884068d58815a0da6,True,False,,,,,0,1647957512,,0,{},i1ntrm9,False,t3_tjb6cf,False,True,t1_i1nfw8r,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tjb6cf/ukraine_megathread_march_21/i1ntrm9/,1647957523,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647928712.0,
[],False,,W4RD06,,,[],,,,text,t2_m8fs0,False,False,"&gt; At some point the west will have to realize that popular opinion on this war will not sour to the point of there being a significant chance for a revolution or something - under any circumstances.

It didn't take a revolution to get the Soviets out of Afghanistan, who says there needs to be one to get the Russians out of Ukraine?

I'm not saying these things with some naive thought process that Russians think the same way westerners do but the Russian government is not magically immune to discontent because of its culture. I'm not even saying discontent is likely to grow at a quick rate but I think you're disregarding it as a factor simply because of the (western) perception that the Russian people are just too apathetic, docile, and conformist to give a shit as their economy crumbles around them and their sons return in body bags from a war that their government is obviously lying to them about.

&gt;""you won less harder than you thought"" isn't equivalent to ""you lose"".

That's the whole thing though, isn't it? The Russians have put themselves in a situation where if they don't win decisively then eventually they WILL lose. The Ukrainians are not going to accept half measures, this is their country they are fighting for.

As to that point; I think your concept of the Russians eventually ""winning"" through just turtling themselves on the front line is erroneously based on the idea that the Ukrainians lack the willpower for an extended war. Statements like:

&gt;Even if the Ukranian leadership thinks they're winning, ultimately this war is fought entirely on Ukranian soil, killing entirely Ukrainian civilians, and destroying entirely Ukrainian cities - so they have an inherent self-interest in a cease fire.

Don't take into account how high Ukrainian morale is and how firmly they, as a nation, seem to believe in fighting until the invader is expelled from their lands. It is, of course, impossible to know if that detail will hold true several months down the line if the war lasts that long but its also impossible to say that it will not hold true.

By the way I don't know where you get the idea that the Ukrainians are currently desperate for a ceasefire. They are looking for one, yes, but their government has also basically stated every time its come up that they aren't looking to concede any territory to the Russians in such talks so...they obviously are prepared to continue fighting even as their cities get pounded into dust around them.

Speaking of which, Mariupol. Something like 80% of the city is fucked at this point and the city WILL probably fall within the next days or weeks...and yet its defenders continue to fight. Why? Its a microcosm for the whole war; the people of Ukraine AND its government believe this is an existential fight for them. If they take a ceasefire and just hand all the land they've lost to the Russians what then for them? Just sit with their new borders as a weakened rump state and wait for the Russians to come back in a few years and finish them off?

The Ukrainians are not interested, publicly, at this point in any land concessions to the Russians and personally I'd be surprised if that changes even after a prolonged fight.

&gt;Saddam came back from the Kuwait thing with less than nothing and he was significantly less popular before that war than Putin is now, and he retained power.

Well, Saddam is not Putin, Iraq is not Russia and the FSB and Putin's oligarchs might be a bunch of yesmen but how long is that going to last?

I really don't know why people keep bringing up Saddam. Not every tinpot dictator in the world has the same exact circumstances playing for them not to mention the two you just compared are from two completely different cultures and countries.

&gt; ""Saving face"" is just another one of those things that the west kind of assumes Putin needs to do without strong reason to actually believe that.

Speaking of which...Putin is not the god king of Russia, there are other powerful people in Russia who are probably right now discussing ways to implement replacing him if he doesn't ""save face"" which is something you seem to think he has no need to do.

&gt;Losing over 70% of its coast is going to severely cripple any Ukrainian remnant state economically.

If the Russians keep it. The Ukrainians know this and so far seem to be pretty uninterested in ceasing hostilities until the Russians leave as I said further up. Until that will to fight shows signs of evaporating there's not reason to believe the Ukrainians will stop fighting for their land back. While the war goes on they pretty much have all the economic backing they need from the rest of Europe.

&gt; I think people should honestly think about the chances of an effective insurrection happening. It's really not a given - people are assuming it is because it was such a big feature in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Well at this point I'm not even assuming the war gets to the point of insurrection. There is no reason to believe as long as Ukraine has an army that it will stop fighting. Unless for some reason this war manages to buck the long established historical trend of an imperialist aggressor trying to invade and occupy a place and then losing the political will to do so after months or years of pointless struggle. I have seen nothing and the Ukrainians have not themselves given any indication that this will be the case.

&gt;And what if it does, but ultimately Russia is willing to tank the consequences, like in Chechnya?

The First Chechen War lasted almost two years and killed something like 6k or more Russian soldiers

The Second Chechen War lasted a year and then had an insurgency phase of about nine years and killed something like 7.5k Russians soldiers

Yeah yeah media control, dictatorship cracking down on desent, blah blah. You can't cover up the loss of a hundred thousand troops. The Russian public will figure out sooner or later how poorly the army is doing if they remain in Ukraine for months with no signs of victory.

I think most people that aren't from there really don't understand the Russian public and just how incredibly docile and conformist it's become.

Like dude, the Russians that cared have mostly either left, given up, or were murdered over the past 2 decades.  At some point the west will have to realize that popular opinion on this war will not sour to the point of there being a significant chance for a revolution or something - under any circumstances.

I think also westerners have this idea that Russians just don't know what's happening (which admittedly is partially true) and as soon as they find out they'll instantly flip over like it's a pixar movie or something.  People need to understand that **many Russians are choosing (either subconsciously or consciously) to believe what's on the telly, and they'll keep believing it even if contrary evidence does really emerge**.  There's not going to be a ""great anagnorisis"" here.

&gt; Putin went in with specific political objectives which he is having a very hard time so far in accomplishing and in fact may never accomplish at this rate.

This goes under the ""But Russia was hoping for a total victory"" counterargument which I've already explained.  ""you won less harder than you thought"" isn't equivalent to ""you lose"".

&gt;If Putin wants to come out of this saving any sort of political face he has no choice but to advance.

Saddam came back from the Kuwait thing with **less than nothing** and he was significantly less popular before that war than Putin is now, and he retained power.  Putin's not coming back with nothing.  ""Saving face"" is just another one of those things that the west kind of assumes Putin needs to do without strong reason to actually believe that.

&gt;Thousands of kilometers of hostile front lines that will keep killing Russian soldiers for as long as it exists? Cities of people who protest against their occupiers daily and are probably going to start shooting them soon?

Ok you're making two arguments here, one of which is sensible and one of which isn't.

The one that isn't sensible - you're underestimating the value of the eastern coastline to Ukraine.  Losing over 70% of its coast is going to severely cripple any Ukrainian remnant state economically.  Furthermore, Russia's on the record as wanting a land bridge between the separatist zones and Crimea, and well, they basically have it now.

The point that has some credibility is that even if Russia stops advancing, they'll keep losing troops to Ukranian harassment and insurrection.  

But again, even if Ukraine mobilizes far more troops, it would be utterly unable to make counterpushes into the meat of Russian territory.  It's not a realistic option.  So they'd be relegated to entrench themselves facing the russians and play artillery tennis for months if not years - which I'm not clear they'd be willing to do for a long period of time - ultimately they'd be losing resources and lives basically just to, what, shell their own territory to spite the Russians?  They're already mulling a ceasefire, so I don't share your enthusiasm that they'll reject a ""status quo"" ceasefire and instead choose to have a hostile front open for years.

There is the insurrection angle, which I think westerners have a lot of money riding on.  I think people should honestly think about the chances of an effective insurrection happening.  It's really not a given - people are assuming it is because it was such a big feature in Iraq and Afghanistan.  But Ukranians aren't afghans.  They've got balls, sure, but there's a world of difference between ""having balls"" and committing your life and death to the brutal and totalist mindset of insurrection.  

So I think a question no think tank in the West is asking is - what if an effective long-term insurrection doesn't materialize?   And what if it does, but ultimately Russia is willing to tank the consequences, like in Chechnya?  It's far from a foregone conclusion.

&gt;Cities of people who protest against their occupiers daily and are probably going to start shooting them soon?

They better start soon, because their occupiers are already shooting the protesters, starting that game early.

&gt;Now, I am guessing that Russia is taking time to actually reassemble their forces into functional and organized battle groups, which would take weeks. 

That's what people *think*, but are there any indications that this is what they're actually doing?

Note that the US can't even determine if there's an [actual overall commander leading the war effort](https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/21/politics/us-russia-top-military-commander-ukraine-war/index.html); if that's true, then where is the direction needed to reassemble their forces going to originate? 

Are they going to reassemble their forces *in* Ukraine, using dodgy communications, under the watch of drones and with partisans/Ukraine SOF operating in the rear?

Surely Putin wont give a single fuck but do you think the Russians as a whole wont? Yeah yeah media control, dictatorship cracking down on desent, blah blah. You can't cover up the loss of a hundred thousand troops. The Russian public will figure out sooner or later how poorly the army is doing if they remain in Ukraine for months with no signs of victory.

&gt;The land they have accumulated (once Mariupol falls) is significant, and the side that has gained significant land in a war has won.

That isn't even close to being true in this case though. Putin went in with specific political objectives which he is having a very hard time so far in accomplishing and in fact may never accomplish at this rate. These objectives are not served by the Russians simply digging in with the one or two minor cities they've captured and getting bled by Ukrainians bearing western weapons. If Putin wants to come out of this saving any sort of political face he has no choice but to advance. If the lines continue to stagnate everything only gets worse for Russia politically, economically and militarily. Its why they wanted a lightning war and framed it to their citizens as such. I have no idea how you can say ""all Russia has to do is take Mariupol and dig in and they've won."" What have they won? Thousands of kilometers of hostile front lines that will keep killing Russian soldiers for as long as it exists? Cities of people who protest against their occupiers daily and are probably going to start shooting them soon?

All the Russians have won themselves is a quagmire and Putin may have the same sensibilities about his army's losses as Stalin did but he doesn't have the existential threat to justify such losses to his own people.",d5bba40ea4b4e9083e6c43c1e20ae50e4b6a52fb,True,False,,,,,0,1647950984,,0,{},i1ngpfa,False,t3_tjqfpz,False,True,t1_i1n73lk,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tjqfpz/why_cant_the_west_admit_that_ukraine_is_winning/i1ngpfa/,1647950999,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647922184.0,

Russian nuclear doctrine calls for ""descalation"" of a conventional conflict through the use of tactical and strategic nuclear weapons. 

What does that mean? Their doctrine specifically directs them to use nuclear weapons early against NATO assets if a conventional war starts going badly. Essentially the idea being to climb the escalation ladder so quickly that the West blinks and capitulates. 

Now I'm not saying that would work, what I am saying is that your suggested course of action per doctrine directly leads to them nuking NATO airbases at minimum.

a) Mariupol **will** fall.  It might take another week, it might be tommorow, but this is one of the few things that are certain about the future of this war

b) that will leave Russia with complete control of a land bridge to Crimea, over half of Ukraines coast, and most of Luhansk.

At that point, Russia could say: ""yep I'm done advancing.  Charge into my artillery if you want any of this land back lmao"".  And that's that.  When you (Ukraine) lose a significant chunk of your land (including some with significant tactical value), you haven't won.

Now there are three possible counterarguments, all of which completely futile:

""but Russia lost a lot of troops""

Yes, but **they could not care less**.  To Putin troops are a means to an end, he could lose 100 thousand troops in Ukraine and not give a single fuck, as long as they accomplished some tactical objective.  There is one side that cares deeply about both civilian and military casualties - Ukraine.  And incidentally, they're incurring plenty of both.

""But Russia was hoping for a total victory""

Maybe, but what they've come out with thus far is still a victory.  The land they have accumulated (once Mariupol falls) is significant, and the side that has gained significant land in a war has won.

""But Ukraine can launch counteroffensives to retake the Eastern coastline""

No, they cannot.  If they're smart, they won't even try.

That is an interesting thought. NATO doesn't want to intervene bc of the nuclear question, but if Putin feels desperate enough to try breaking Ukrainian ground forces with a tactical nuke, that line's been crossed.

No, these are just my perspectives.

When the war in 2014 broke out, most of the heavy equipment Ukraine had sitting in warehouses turned out to be non-functional due to corruption / lack of maintenance.

You will have plans for how many supply companies per infantry battalion, who is predesignated staff for HQ company, how the battalions will be organized into brigades and divisions.

Complete with LINKS.

What it basically comes down to is you want us to believe that Ukraine, a country without a mechanized army, 8 years after losing said force to Russia in a six month hotwar masquerading as a insurgency, is somehow able to mount a credible defense against a MUCH LARGER, mechanized army, using a smattering of CCWS/SLM and some Man Portables, distributed about the country before the Russians closed down the roadnets.

How very _Sword Point_ ish of you.

Javelins, NLAW and Stinger are the weapons which a dedicated professional military uses to attrite a mechanized force in passing, slowing it for later engagement by proper, maneuver based, forces then in standup.  Which can then seize and hold terrain to create a FEBA and cut the enemy into pieces by counter stroking across it.

Russia has undoubtedly been hurt by the not-ZSU forces now bushwacking it.

Yet the SV is still camped on Kyiv's doorstep.  With the better part of a 200,000 man strong occupational force still intact while facing a Ukrainian Army which has, at best, 30,000 men on any given axis.  And no tanks/IFV.

And yet you still refuse to believe that everything to this point is more than a holding action by foreign Special Operations Forces.  Which would at least allow Zelensky to mass his reserves on ONE A/A, to dislodge the Russians around Kyiv while a covering force held the others.

Zelensky is doing no such thing because he doesn't have any army.  He has a bunch of 18-22 year olds from last year's recruit pool with, on average, 6 month conscription training.  A force who were generating a 16% draft dodge/desertion rate, in 2014-15, when it actually mattered, as the ZSU was chewed to pieces, in the Donbass.

Zelensky says nothing about this.  And this is the Ukrainian NCA and Military which we have centered our 'hope and change' delusions upon.

A Russian BTR infantry fighting vehicle drove up to the blown-up bridge over the Mertvovod, opening fire on the Territorial Defense base to the left. Five tanks, supported by a BTR, drove to a wheat field overlooking Voznesensk.

A group of Territorial Defense volunteers armed with Kalashnikovs was hiding in a building at that field’s edge. They didn’t have much of a chance against the BTR’s large-caliber machine gun, said Mykola, one of the city’s Territorial Defense officers; some were killed, others escaped. Russian troops in two Ural trucks were preparing to assemble and set up 120mm mortars on the wheat field, but they got only as far as unloading the ammunition before Ukrainian shelling began.


Russian soldiers took over villagers’ homes during their advance on Voznesensk; above and below, Ukrainian troops inspect such houses in Rakove.

Phoning in coordinates
As darkness fell March 2, Mykola, who owns a company transporting gravel and sand, took cover in a grove on the wheat field’s edge under pouring rain. The Russian tanks there would fire into Voznesensk and immediately drive a few hundred yards away to escape return fire, he said.

Mykola was on the phone with a Ukrainian artillery unit. Sending coordinates via the Viber social-messaging app, he directed artillery fire at the Russians. So did other local Territorial Defense volunteers around the city. “Everyone helped,” he said. “Everyone shared the information.”

Ukrainian shelling blew craters in the field, and some Russian vehicles sustained direct hits. Other Ukrainian regular troops and Territorial Defense forces moved toward Russian positions on foot, hitting vehicles with U.S.-supplied Javelin missiles. As Russian armor caught fire—including three of the five tanks in the wheat field—soldiers abandoned functioning vehicles and escaped on foot or sped off in the BTRs that still had fuel. They left crates of ammunition.

Mykola picked up a Russian conscript days later, he said, who served as an assistant artillery specialist at a Grad multiple-rocket launcher that attacked Voznesensk from a forest. The 18-year-old conscript, originally from eastern Ukraine and a Crimea resident since 2014, suffered a concussion after a Ukrainian shell hit near him. He woke the next morning, left his weapon and wandered into a village, Mykola said. There, a woman took him into her home and called the village head, who informed Territorial Defense. “He’s still in shock about what happened to him,” Mykola said.

Vadym, the reconnaissance-unit commander, said he captured several soldiers in their early 20s and a 31-year-old senior lieutenant from the Russian military intelligence. The lieutenant, he said, had forced a private to swap uniforms but was discovered because of the age discrepancy—and because Ukrainian forces found Russian personnel files in the column’s command vehicle.

“The Russians had orders to come in, seize, and await further instructions,” Vadym said. “But they had no orders for what to do if they are defeated. That, they didn’t plan for.”

Russian troops had detained a local man on March 2 after they found him to have binoculars, villagers said. “They had put him in a cellar and told him they will execute him in the morning, for correcting artillery fire,” Vadym said, adding that the detainee wasn’t a spotter. “But in the morning they didn’t have time to execute him. They were too busy fleeing.”

The Russians retreat
As the Russian forces retreated on March 3, they shelled the downhill part of Rakove. A direct hit pierced the roof of the local clinic, where Vadym’s mother, Raisa, worked as a nurse. “We’ve just built a new roof,” she sighed, showing the gaping hole. “But it doesn’t matter. The main thing is that we have kicked them out, and survived.”

When villagers returned to Rakove on March 4, they found their homes ransacked. “Blankets, cutlery, all gone. Lard, milk, cheese, also gone,” said Ms. Horchuk. “They didn’t take the potatoes because they didn’t have time to cook.”

This week, village homes still bore traces of Russian soldiers. Cupboards and closets were still flung open from looting, and Russian military rations and half-eaten jars of pickles and preserves littered floors.

The Ukrainian army’s 80th brigade was towing away the last remaining Russian BTRs with “Z” painted on their sides, the identification markers that in Russia have become the symbol of the invasion. About 15 Russian tanks and other vehicles were in working or salvageable condition, said Vadym. “We are ready to hit the Russians with their own weapons,” he said. Others, mostly burned-out wrecks, were removed from streets because they scared civilians and contained ordnance, the mayor said.

Mr. Velichko, the mayor, fielded citizen phone calls Tuesday, telling one he would take care of a possibly rabid dog and assuring another that her utilities wouldn’t be cut in wartime even if she was late in paying. He argued with an army commander because Ukrainian soldiers had siphoned fuel from the gas station.

A rapid Russian advance into the strategic southern town of 35,000 people, a gateway to a Ukrainian nuclear power station and pathway to attack Odessa from the back, would have showcased the Russian military’s abilities and severed Ukraine’s key communications lines.

Instead, the two-day battle of Voznesensk, details of which are only now emerging, turned decisively against the Russians. Judging from the destroyed and abandoned armor, Ukrainian forces, which comprised local volunteers and the professional military, eliminated most of a Russian battalion tactical group on March 2 and 3.

The Ukrainian defenders’ performance against a much-better-armed enemy in an overwhelmingly Russian-speaking region was successful in part because of widespread popular support for the Ukrainian cause—one reason the Russian invasion across the country has failed to achieve its principal goals so far. Ukraine on Wednesday said it was launching a counteroffensive on several fronts.

“Everyone is united against the common enemy,” said Voznesensk’s 32-year-old mayor, Yevheni Velichko, a former real-estate developer turned wartime commander, who, like other local officials, moves around with a gun. “We are defending our own land. We are at home.”

The Russian military says its Ukraine offensive is developing successfully and according to plan. Moscow hasn’t released updated casualty figures since acknowledging on March 2 the death of 498 troops, before the Voznesensk battle.

Russian survivors of the Voznesensk battle left behind nearly 30 of their 43 vehicles—tanks, armored personnel carriers, multiple-rocket launchers, trucks—as well as a downed Mi-24 attack helicopter, according to Ukrainian officials in the city. The helicopter’s remnants and some pieces of burned-out Russian armor were still scattered around Voznesensk on Tuesday.

Russian forces retreated more than 40 miles to the southeast, where other Ukrainian units have continued pounding them. Some dispersed in nearby forests, where local officials said 10 soldiers have been captured.

“We didn’t have a single tank against them, just rocket-propelled grenades, Javelin missiles and the help of artillery,” said Vadym, commander of the Ukrainian special-forces reconnaissance group in the area and a Voznesensk resident. “The Russians didn’t expect us to be so strong. It was a surprise for them. If they had taken Voznesensk, they would have cut off the whole south of Ukraine.”

Ukrainian officers estimated that some 100 Russian troops died in Voznesensk, including those whose bodies were taken by retreating Russian troops or burned inside carbonized vehicles. As of Tuesday, 11 dead Russian soldiers were in the railway car turned morgue, with search parties looking for other bodies in nearby forests. Villagers buried some others.

“Sometimes, I wish I could put these bodies on a plane and drop them all onto Moscow, so they realize what is happening here,” said Mr. Sokurenko, the funeral director, as he put Tuesday’s fifth Russian cadaver on blue-plastic sheeting inside his van marked “Cargo 200”—Soviet military slang for killed in action. A Ukrainian military explosives specialist accompanied him, because some bodies had been booby trapped.

About 10 Ukrainian civilians died in Voznesensk during the combat and two more after hitting a land mine afterward, local officials said. Ukraine doesn’t disclose its military losses. There were fatalities, mostly among the Territorial Defense volunteer forces, local residents said.

The Russian operation to seize Voznesensk, 20 miles from the South Ukrainian Nuclear Power Plant, was ambitious and well-equipped. It began after Russian forces fanned out of the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow severed from Ukraine and annexed in 2014, and thrust northward to seize the regional capital of Kherson on March 1. They pushed to the edge of Mykolaiv, the last major city before Odessa, Ukraine’s main port.

About 55 miles north of Mykolaiv, Voznesensk offered an alternative bridge over the Southern Bug river and access to the main highway linking Odessa with the rest of Ukraine. Russian forces raced toward the town at the same time as they made a successful push northeast to seize the city of Enerhodar, where another major Ukrainian nuclear power plant is located. Voznesensk’s fall would have made defending the nuclear plant to the north of here nearly impossible, military officials said.

Mayor Velichko worked with local businessmen to dig up the shores of the Mertvovod river that cuts through town so armored personnel vehicles couldn’t ford it. He got other businessmen who owned a quarry and a construction company to block off most streets to channel the Russian column into areas that would be easier to hit with artillery.

Ahead of the Russian advance, military engineers blew up the bridge over the Mertvovod and a railroad bridge on the town’s edge. Waiting for the Russians in and around Voznesensk were Ukrainian regular army troops and members of the Territorial Defense force, which Ukraine established in January, recruiting and arming volunteers to help protect local communities. Local witnesses, officials and Ukrainian combat participants recounted what happened next.

Missile strikes
The Russian assault began with missile strikes and shelling that hit central Voznesensk, destroying the municipal swimming pool and damaging high-rises. Helicopters dropped Russian air-assault troops in a forested ridge southwest of Voznesensk, as an armored column drove from the southeast. Mr. Velichko said a local collaborator with the Russians, a woman driving a Hyundai SUV, showed the Russian column a way through back roads.

Ukrainian officers estimate that some 400 Russian troops took part in the attack. The number would have been bigger if these forces—mostly from the 126th naval infantry brigade based in Perevalnoye, Crimea, according to seized documents—hadn’t come under heavy shelling along the way.

Natalia Horchuk, a 25-year-old mother of three, said Russian soldiers appeared in her garden in the village of Rakove in the Voznesensk municipality early March 2. They told her and neighbors to leave for their safety, and parked four tanks and infantry fighting vehicles between the houses. “Do you have anywhere to go?” she recalled them asking. “This place will be hit.”

“We can hide in the cellar,” she replied.

“The cellar won’t help you,” they told her. Hiding valuables, she and her family fled, as did most neighbors.

Outside Rakove, Volodymyr Kichuk, a guard at a walnut plantation, woke to find five Russian airborne troops in his hut. They took his phone and forced him to lie on the ground, said his wife, Hanna. “Once they realized there was nothing to steal, they told him: You can get up after we leave,” she said. By day’s end, the couple were gone from the village.

Russian soldiers took over villagers’ homes in Rakove and created a sniper position on a roof. They looked for sacks to fill with soil for fortifications, burned hay to create a smoke screen and demanded food.

A local woman who agreed to cook for the Russians is now under investigation, said Vadym. “A traitor—she did it for money,” he said. “I don’t think the village will forgive her and let her live here.”",0e0461f2e58a3774023a9361a85574fe0f6fcf50,True,False,,,,,0,1647928183,,0,{},i1mo3mh,True,t3_tjqfpz,False,True,t1_i1mn4gv,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tjqfpz/why_cant_the_west_admit_that_ukraine_is_winning/i1mo3mh/,1647928195,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647899383.0,

Assume Ukraine gets lots of weapons with a range of  up to 100km with which to locate Russian forces and destroy them -- for example drones, artillery-locating radar, and rocket artillery. And also long range SAMs to counter Russian air power.

Further assume Ukraine uses these assets to impede Russian logistics, and destroy their artillery (which is Russia's most effective weapon).

Then once Russian artillery capability is nullified, and Russian troops' morale gets even lower -- if they're badly supplied, and being regularly picked off by drones and snipers, Ukraine can launch limited counteroffensives, for example spearheaded by special forces, and aimed at weak points in the Russian lines (the front line is c. 2000 km long and Russia has about 200,000 men in 125 BTGs, so there should be lots of weak points where special forces can infiltrate at night).

Then some of these attacks might lead to Russian units disintegrating/surrendering, which might lead to a general retreat in some areas (for example to avoid being surrounded), which if badly exacuted may turn into a rout.

I could imagine something like that happening in 2-3 months.

You are sort of right. They did ""rule them out"" but they left the window open for later ""lets see in a month"". Turns out a month passes by rather quickly when lots of things are happening I guess.

&gt; NATO is a mutual defense pact. It hasn't been challenged and there is a reason for it: because Putin obviously fears that threat. If he didn't, it would certainly have been easier to invade any of the Baltic states than it was to invade Ukraine.

I think by drawing the line at NATO it essentially concedes the rest of Europe as fair game to Putin. I think NATO could do the intervention but it doesn't have to be under NATO, and its not like its the first time that NATO acted within Europe outside of defense - NATO conducted the bombing in Serbia for example without any NATO members being threated by it. 

&gt; This world is based on nuclear deterrence, not international law, and Ukraine was not protected. The nuclear weapons are not only mean words. They are in fact real. You do understand that, right?

Don't talk down to people, its rude.

&gt; You are advocating war between nuclear powers. It's suicide. If you're sure we're not bluffing about our own nuclear weapons, what makes you so willing to gamble every life in the northern hemisphere on your guess that maybe the Russians are bluffing?

This is a false choice that I've specifically called out. By ""playing it safe"" now you are just kicking the can down the road, until a time you have no choice but to ""gamble every life in the northern hemisphere on your guess that maybe the Russians are bluffing"". What if Russia decides to invade the Baltics and says well if other NATO countries intervene we will nuke you? Would you be willing to ""gamble every life in the northern hemisphere on your guess that maybe the Russians are bluffing"" in that condition?

&gt;before police slowly and calmly moved in to disperse them.

Good fucking luck doing that dispersion without the implicit threat of greater violence.

&gt;3. The protestors weren't even protesting things the Canadian federal government had control over, because they were protesting provincial vaccine and mask mandates.

Excellent reasons to sic the police on them

&gt;4. Bank accounts were temporarily frozen and vehicles temporarily impounded until they were no longer factors in the protest, and then they were returned. No seizure of property happened.

There are other cases elsewhere. I'm pointing out a recent case, but, for example, Waco ended with people getting shot, burned to death, mass deaths, and slaps on the wrists of surviving police. Bundy clan standoff ended with seizures, courts, and prisons.

&gt;This is not even to touch on the ridiculous claim that a government that thinks its citizens should be killed for opposing it

I can cite a book on the matter called Controlling Paris: Armed Forces and Counter-Revolution, 1789-1848 by Jonathan House that showed that most of the time, the government and army wasn't ready for and set out to kill.everybody. Army colonels were shot under the flag of truce trying to convince the rebels to stand down. There are the exceptions, like Bonaparte, which gave the people a whiff of grapeshots (and rewarded with his first commission). So if we judge by intentions it's not certain that they were extremely brutal.

&gt;The nature of the Canadian response to the protestors

The nature is violence and threat of violence lays at the bedrock of government powers. Of course, the army and police try to match force with force. 19th century Parisian rebels resorts to muskets do they were answered with cannons.

Tell me you don't understand the Canadian anti-mandate protests without telling me you don't understand the protests. 

1. More than 90% of all Canadian truckers were not involved in nor supportive of the protests, so to cast them as ""trucker protests"" is to believe the narrative in certain media outlets.

2. The protestors were allowed to literally shit in the street, harass food kitchens, block access for emergency vehicles, and set up saunas and camps for 3 weeks before police slowly and calmly moved in to disperse them. No tear gas, no batons, certainly no rubber bullets.

3. The protestors weren't even protesting things the Canadian federal government had control over, because they were protesting provincial vaccine and mask mandates.

4. Bank accounts were temporarily frozen and vehicles temporarily impounded until they were no longer factors in the protest, and then they were returned. No seizure of property happened.

The nature of the Canadian response to the protestors was fundamentally different from the nature of the 19th-century French military killing protestors because you have missed something that so-called ""realists"" do not understand: **governments are made up of people, and people change their governments to reflect their values** (and the values of the populace depending on their level of popular support).

[],False,,cretan_bull,,,[],,,,text,t2_93kjo,False,False,"This article matches quite closely with my own observations and beliefs.

I think the question of why this view is so much at odds with most analysts, comes down to a two factors: status quo bias and professional pessimism.

Analysts don't like to be wrong, for a variety of reasons both personal and professional, so when there's a great deal of uncertainty most are reluctant to draw conclusions or make predictions until they're very confident in them. That results in a systematic bias towards the status quo, which in this case is the pre-war prediction that Russia would roll over Ukraine but get bogged down in an insurgency. As data comes in, their beliefs will update, but only quite slowly due to how confused the picture is.

The second factor is that, in general, the consequences for being excessively pessimistic are much less bad than for being excessively optimistic, which introduces its own, separate, bias. Note that this is a separate effect, because in situations where everything seems very clearly to be going very well the status-quo bias points in the other direction (e.g. the 2003 Invasion of Iraq where the overwhelming success of the early stages of the campaign lured most into an excessively optimistic view of the ease of the occupation. Some might have been suitably pessimistic, but I believe that was very much a minority viewpoint)

I'm not saying this article's view is necessarily right. That's what uncertainty *means*. What I am saying is that I think this is an accurate (but not necessarily precise) analysis, based on the totality of the information available (limited though it is).

It's kind of funny because in other, less rigorous subs, I see many complaints that everyone is blindly believing that Ukraine is winning and ignoring reality, etc. I guess the circles you move in really do influence what you believe everyone is saying.

Certainly, I think fighting Russia to a standstill would amount to a strategic win for Ukraine, as they are more likely to be able to outlast Russia in terms of enthusiasm and actually usable manpower, so long as Western weapons and supplies keep coming. However I would hesitate to describe them as ""winning"" until I see evidence that they have decisively seized the momentum which Russia so clearly lost some days into this invasion. That, or if this remains an entirely attritional conflict, evidence that Russian losses are inflicting an intolerable political  or military cost on the Putin regime. Although there have been protests and dissent by many brave individuals, I think it will take much more for Putin to feel threatened at home. 

And while Russia has taken heavy losses so far in men and materiel (even by conservative estimates), I don't see indications that those losses have nullified their offensive capabilities altogether, merely degraded them. They are still gaining some ground and are actually engaging in urban combat (as opposed to artillery sieges) in places like Mariupol. Until Russia loses the ability to make those kinds of advances or Ukraine's resistance becomes strong enough to prevent them entirely, I'm not sure this is actually a stalemate yet, although it is strongly starting to resemble one.

Anyway, the question of who is ""winning"" is a somewhat semantic one. We know what Putin's strategic goals were before this invasion and it is abundantly clear that he is further than ever from reaching them. Just by waging this war he has already inflicted grievous damage on his strategic position by unifying NATO and the EU, and isolating Russia, in ways that seemed distant in January. The vast majority of his military objectives in Ukraine remain unachieved, nearly one month in. He seems to have abandoned the idea of regime change, instead shortening his list of demands to territorial concessions and securing Ukrainian neutrality.

Fair enough.  Yeah I certainly agree with Russia not being able to ""win"" at this point...no where near enough troops for a proper occupation anyways - Not to mention a hostile Ukrainian populace, and the massive weapon &amp; intelligence support being received from NATO.  And the crushing sanctions against Russia. 

But despite lack of remaining PGMs or other high-end systems, I assume Russia still has a ton of artillery.  Logistics is obviously yet another variable needed to make that artillery work and it's been sub-par for such a large force...so I'm more wondering how much more damage they can inflict before the Russian military machine completely breaks down.  Weeks/months?  (I know none of us know, just guesstimations)  This is of course assuming no NBC weapons.

I did read an interesting article that said the russian operational strategy may be shifting to try and cut off and encircle the Ukrainian army that's in the east near donetsk and luhansk.

&gt;Russian losses are staggering—between 7,000 and 14,000 soldiers dead, depending on your source, which implies (using a low-end rule of thumb about the ratios of such things) a minimum of nearly 30,000 taken off the battlefield by wounds, capture, or disappearance. Such a total would represent at least 15 percent of the entire invading force, enough to render most units combat ineffective. And there is no reason to think that the rate of loss is abating—in fact, Western intelligence agencies are briefing unsustainable Russian casualty rates of a thousand a day.

Rather, he seems to be taking the low end figure that he has provides, 7000 deaths (a number which was provided by US military intelligence [some days ago](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/16/us/politics/russia-troop-deaths.html)) and using the traditional rule of thumb that the dead to wounded ratio in a modern armed conflict is probably going to be about 1:3. So 7000 + (7000\*3) = 28,000. Then he rounded up to get to 30k. At least I think that's what he did.

If he was taking the Ukrainian MoD at face value and using the same rule of thumb, he would arrive at a total casualties figure of 56,000.

[],False,,SmirkingImperialist,,,[],,,,text,t2_27pmqe,False,False,"It's tricky to calculate combat effectiveness from raw casualty numbers. First of all, we can make fun all we want about the Russian logistics, but they probably also have a fat logistical tail, too, so only a small fraction of the troops are actually combat troops. On the hand, since combat troops take most of the casualties, counting casualties vs. total troops underestimate damage to the combat arms.

Combat effectiveness available at a certain troop strength level varies with the task. A squad at 30% strength can still keep all of their heavy weapons in play: the LMG/SAW, the anti-tank rocket/grenade launcher, and the DMR. If you pick a defensive positions carefully and assign the squad a narrow sectors and use multiple 30% squads to create overlapping fields of fire, a 30% rifle platoon or company can still be very effective on the defence, as long as they have a pile of ammunition on hand and keep the ammunition up.

A mechanised infantry squad with 30% strength can still have enough people to crew the IFV, which still has big fuck-off autocannons, MGs, and ATGMs. at 30% strength and one vehicle remaining, a mech infantry platoon can still be crammed into one vehicle and drive around. 

The thing that is lacking with an understrength unit is mobility. Infantry on the attack, by themselves, seek to close to hand grenade range to toss grenades and flush the enemy out of their positions; that is, if the opposition has not been destroyed or routed with indirect fire support or air strikes.

Ukrainian Army and Territorial Defence Forces excel with light infantry and light vehicles hit-and-run and ambushes, which work well enough when the Russians are strung out and on the attack. If the Russians take enough attrition that they switch to the defensive to hold on the grounds they have, it will be the Ukrainians' turn to make costly infantry-based attacks to drive the Russians out of their defensive positions. Given that the Ukrainians weren't able to do that between 2014 and now via-a-vis the two separatist regions, I'll say that's not an easy task.

So, in the absence of someone removing Putin from the equation, how does it serve either the West or Ukraine to crow about how Ukraine is winning this war? 

The best chance to end this conflict without radically destabilizing the entire region is to find Putin an off ramp that he can live with and sell as a success of his ""special military operation"".

Granted, my sample size is small, but I haven't observed much of a reluctance to say that Ukrainians are winning, but more a reluctance to make explicit statements on forecasting the war. Relatively speaking, this is still a very young war and the Russians, if nothing else, have left us all guessing as to wtf they are doing. 

As mentioned in the article, many analysts expected the Russians to pump the brakes, regroup, and continue the war in a more conventional way that coincides with their doctrine. Instead, we've seen a doubling down on their initial strategy that turned out to be an absolute blunder. It's clear the Russians did not approach the situation expecting their invasion to morph into a shooting war. 

Really the only issue I take with this article is the proposed path forward. Right now we are walking a tight rope. How much can we punish Russia and help the Ukrainians before the Russians consider it an escalation? Would openly interferring with the Russian populace be a bridge too far? Any real pressure on Putin to end this war is going to need to come from Russians and we know that as of now, they are largely in support of military action in Ukraine.

[],False,,bleepblopbloopy,,,[],,,,text,t2_4lu6l,False,True,"Concurrent with its new offensive strategy, Russia embarked on a modernization of its nuclear forces, including its less destructive arms. As in the West, some of the warheads were given variable explosive yields that could be dialed up or down depending on the military situation.

A centerpiece of the new arsenal was the Iskander-M, first deployed in 2005. The mobile launcher can fire two missiles that travel roughly 300 miles. The missiles can carry conventional as well as nuclear warheads. Russian figures put the smallest nuclear blast from those missiles at roughly a third that of the Hiroshima bomb.

Before the Russian army invaded Ukraine, satellite images showed that Moscow had deployed Iskander missile batteries in Belarus and to its east in Russian territory. There’s no public data on whether Russia has armed any of the Iskanders with nuclear warheads.

Nikolai Sokov, a former Russian diplomat who negotiated arms control treaties in Soviet times, said that nuclear warheads could also be placed on cruise missiles. The low-flying weapons, launched from planes, ships or the ground, hug the local terrain to avoid detection by enemy radar.

From inside Russian territory, he said, “they can reach all of Europe,” including Britain.

Over the years, the United States and its NATO allies have sought to rival Russia’s arsenal of lesser nuclear arms. It started decades ago as the United States began sending bombs for fighter jets to military bases in Belgium, Germany, Italy, Turkey and the Netherlands. Dr. Kühn noted that the alliance, in contrast to Russia, does not conduct field drills practicing a transition from conventional to nuclear war.

Russia-Ukraine War: Key Developments
Card 1 of 3
Mariupol refuses to yield. Ukraine rejected Russia’s demand to surrender the embattled southern port city, where an estimated 300,000 people remain trapped. In a rare firsthand account on social media, a resident who escaped described what she called a living “hell.”

A bloody stalemate. With the invasion stalled, few signs of progress on peace talks and the war appearing to have reached a stalemate, Russia is turning to deadlier and blunter methods, including a missile strike that reduced a Kyiv shopping mall to a smoldering ruin.

Biden’s diplomatic push. President Biden will travel to Europe for talks with NATO allies this week, in his most direct effort yet to rally opposition to the invasion. In a call with Western leaders ahead of his trip, he assailed Russia’s attacks on civilians and discussed providing assistance to refugees.

In 2010, Mr. Obama, who had long advocated for a “nuclear-free world,” decided to refurbish and improve the NATO weapons, turning them into smart bombs with maneuverable fins that made their targeting highly precise. That, in turn, gave war planners the freedom to lower the weapons’ variable explosive force to as little as 2 percent of that of the Hiroshima bomb.

The reduced blast capability made breaking the nuclear taboo “more thinkable,” Gen. James E. Cartwright, a vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Mr. Obama, warned at the time. He nonetheless backed the program because the high degree of precision lowered the risk of collateral damage and civilian casualties. But after years of funding and manufacturing delays, the refurbished bomb, known as the B61 Model 12, is not expected to be deployed in Europe until next year, Mr. Kristensen said.

The steady Russian buildups and the slow American responses prompted the Trump administration to propose a new missile warhead in 2018. Its destructive force was seen as roughly half that of the Hiroshima bomb, according to Mr. Kristensen. It was to be deployed on the nation’s fleet of 14 ballistic missile submarines.

While some experts warned that the bomb, known as the W76 Model 2, could make it more tempting for a president to order a nuclear strike, the Trump administration argued that the weapon would lower the risk of war by ensuring that Russia would face the threat of proportional counterstrikes. It was deployed in late 2019.

“It’s all about psychology — deadly psychology,” said Franklin C. Miller, a nuclear expert who backed the new warhead and, before leaving public office in 2005, held Pentagon and White House posts for three decades. “If your opponent thinks he has a battlefield edge, you try to convince him that he’s wrong.”

When he was a candidate for the presidency, Joseph R. Biden Jr. called the less powerful warhead a “bad idea” that would make presidents “more inclined” to use it. But Mr. Kristensen said the Biden administration seemed unlikely to remove the new warhead from the nation’s submarines.

It’s unclear how Mr. Biden would respond to the use of a nuclear weapon by Mr. Putin. Nuclear war plans are one of Washington’s most deeply held secrets. Experts say that the war-fighting plans in general go from warning shots to single strikes to multiple retaliations and that the hardest question is whether there are reliable ways to prevent a conflict from escalating.

Even Mr. Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, said he was unsure how he would advise Mr. Biden if Mr. Putin unleashed his nuclear arms.

“When do you stop?” he asked of nuclear retaliation. “You can’t just keep turning the other cheek. At some point we’d have to do something.”

A U.S. response to a small Russian blast, experts say, might be to fire one of the new submarine-launched  warheads into the wilds of Siberia or at a military base inside Russia. Mr. Miller, the former government nuclear official and a former chairman of NATO’s nuclear policy committee, said such a blast would be a way of signaling to Moscow that “this is serious, that things are getting out of hand.”

Military strategists say a tit-for-tat rejoinder would throw the responsibility for further escalation back at Russia, making Moscow feel its ominous weight and ideally keeping the situation from spinning out of control despite the dangers in war of miscalculation and accident.

In a darker scenario, Mr. Putin might resort to using atomic arms if the war in Ukraine spilled into neighboring NATO states. All NATO members, including the United States, are obliged to defend one another — potentially with salvos of nuclear warheads.

Dr. Tannenwald, the political scientist at Brown University, wondered if the old protections of nuclear deterrence, now rooted in opposing lines of less destructive arms, would succeed in keeping the peace.

“It sure doesn’t feel that way in a crisis,” she said.",8e659bc3ab13f3e688edae66fdc33a70311fc29f,True,False,,,,,0,1647913008,,0,{},i1lwwpr,True,t3_tjrn7m,False,True,t1_i1lwtuw,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tjrn7m/the_smaller_bombs_that_could_turn_ukraine_into_a/i1lwwpr/,1647913024,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647884208.0,
[],False,,bleepblopbloopy,,,[],,,,text,t2_4lu6l,False,True,"In destructive power, the behemoths of the Cold War dwarfed the American atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. Washington’s biggest test blast was 1,000 times as large. Moscow’s was 3,000 times. On both sides, the idea was to deter strikes with threats of vast retaliation — with mutual assured destruction, or MAD. The psychological bar was so high that nuclear strikes came to be seen as unthinkable.

Today, both Russia and the United States have nuclear arms that are much less destructive — their power just fractions of the Hiroshima bomb’s force, their use perhaps less frightening and more thinkable.

Concern about these smaller arms has soared as Vladimir V. Putin, in the Ukraine war, has warned of his nuclear might, has put his atomic forces on alert and has had his military carry out risky attacks on nuclear power plants. The fear is that if Mr. Putin feels cornered in the conflict, he might choose to detonate one of his lesser nuclear arms — breaking the taboo set 76 years ago after Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Analysts note that Russian troops have long practiced the transition from conventional to nuclear war, especially as a way to gain the upper hand after battlefield losses. And the military, they add, wielding the world’s largest nuclear arsenal, has explored a variety of escalatory options that Mr. Putin might choose from.

“The chances are low but rising,” said Ulrich Kühn, a nuclear expert at the University of Hamburg and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “The war is not going well for the Russians,” he observed, “and the pressure from the West is increasing.”

Mr. Putin might fire a weapon at an uninhabited area instead of at troops, Dr. Kühn said. In a 2018 study, he laid out a crisis scenario in which Moscow detonated a bomb over a remote part of the North Sea as a way to signal deadlier strikes to come.

“It feels horrible to talk about these things,” Dr. Kühn said in an interview. “But we have to consider that this is becoming a possibility.”

Washington expects more atomic moves from Mr. Putin in the days ahead. Moscow is likely to “increasingly rely on its nuclear deterrent to signal the West and project strength” as the war and its consequences weaken Russia, Lt. Gen. Scott D. Berrier, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told the House Armed Services Committee on Thursday.

President Biden is traveling to a NATO summit in Brussels this week to discuss the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The agenda is expected to include how the alliance will respond if Russia employs chemical, biological, cyber or nuclear weapons.

James R. Clapper Jr., a retired Air Force general who served as President Barack Obama’s director of national intelligence, said Moscow had lowered its bar for atomic use after the Cold War when the Russian army fell into disarray. Today, he added, Russia regards nuclear arms as utilitarian rather than unthinkable.

“They didn’t care,” Mr. Clapper said of Russian troops’ risking a radiation release earlier this month when they attacked the Zaporizhzhia nuclear reactor site — the largest not only in Ukraine but in Europe. “They went ahead and fired on it. That’s indicative of the Russian laissez-faire attitude. They don’t make the distinctions that we do on nuclear weapons.”

Mr. Putin announced last month that he was putting Russian nuclear forces into “special combat readiness.” Pavel Podvig, a longtime researcher of Russia’s nuclear forces, said the alert had most likely primed the Russian command and control system for the possibility of receiving a nuclear order.

It’s unclear how Russia exerts control over its arsenal of less destructive arms. But some U.S. politicians and experts have denounced the smaller weapons on both sides as threatening to upend the global balance of nuclear terror.

For Russia, military analysts note, edgy displays of the less destructive arms have let Mr. Putin polish his reputation for deadly brinkmanship and expand the zone of intimidation he needs to fight a bloody conventional war.

“Putin is using nuclear deterrence to have his way in Ukraine,” said Nina Tannenwald, a political scientist at Brown University who recently profiled the less powerful armaments. “His nuclear weapons keep the West from intervening.”

A global race for the smaller arms is intensifying. Though such weapons are less destructive by Cold War standards, modern estimates show that the equivalent of half a Hiroshima bomb, if detonated in Midtown Manhattan, would kill or injure half a million people.

The case against these arms is that they undermine the nuclear taboo and make crisis situations even more dangerous. Their less destructive nature, critics say, can feed the illusion of atomic control when in fact their use can suddenly flare into a full-blown nuclear war. A simulation devised by experts at Princeton University starts with Moscow firing a nuclear warning shot; NATO responds with a small strike, and the ensuing war yields more than 90 million casualties in its first few hours.

No arms control treaties regulate the lesser warheads, known sometimes as tactical or nonstrategic nuclear weapons, so the nuclear superpowers make and deploy as many as they want. Russia has perhaps 2,000, according to Hans M. Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, a private group in Washington. And the United States has roughly 100 in Europe, a number limited by domestic policy disputes and the political complexities of basing them among NATO allies, whose populations often resist and protest the weapons’ presence.

Russia’s atomic war doctrine came to be known as “escalate to de-escalate” — meaning routed troops would fire a nuclear weapon to stun an aggressor into retreat or submission. Moscow repeatedly practiced the tactic in field exercises. In 1999, for instance, a large drill simulated a NATO attack on Kaliningrad, the Russian enclave on the Baltic Sea. The exercise had Russian forces in disarray until Moscow fired nuclear arms at Poland and the United States.

Dr. Kühn of the University of Hamburg said the defensive training drills of the 1990s had turned toward offense in the 2000s as the Russian army regained some of its former strength.",00666c2bb3c91c2f940bbb398edefc49e2d58802,True,False,,,,,0,1647912971,,0,{},i1lwtuw,True,t3_tjrn7m,False,True,t3_tjrn7m,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tjrn7m/the_smaller_bombs_that_could_turn_ukraine_into_a/i1lwtuw/,1647912988,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647884171.0,

I do admit that I am one of those people who have been very cautious and thinking that Russia could turn things around any day now. The amount of poor planning, execution, and just overall military professionalism on Russia's part has been so staggering that it is hard to let it all sink in. The thought/worry that there must be professionals in the ranks somewhere just waiting to take command and stop the bleeding is something I cannot shake. 

About the author: 

&gt; Eliot A. Cohen is a contributing writer at The Atlantic, a professor at The Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, and the Arleigh Burke chair in strategy at CSIS. From 2007 to 2009, he was the Counselor of the Department of State. He is the author most recently of The Big Stick: The Limits of Soft Power and the Necessity of Military Force.

Selected quote:

&gt; When i visited iraq during the 2007 surge, I discovered that the conventional wisdom in Washington usually lagged the view from the field by two to four weeks. Something similar applies today. Analysts and commentators have grudgingly declared that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has been blocked, and that the war is stalemated. The more likely truth is that the Ukrainians are winning.

&gt; So why can’t Western analysts admit as much? Most professional scholars of the Russian military first predicted a quick and decisive Russian victory; then argued that the Russians would pause, learn from their mistakes, and regroup; then concluded that the Russians would actually have performed much better if they had followed their doctrine; and now tend to mutter that everything can change, that the war is not over, and that the weight of numbers still favors Russia. Their analytic failure will be only one of the elements of this war worth studying in the future.",dfebe780bcbe97fd18347b8e54dfc33147b1c171,True,False,,,,,0,1647909797,,0,{},i1lpv98,True,t3_tjqfpz,False,True,t3_tjqfpz,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tjqfpz/why_cant_the_west_admit_that_ukraine_is_winning/i1lpv98/,1647909813,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647880997.0,

The Ukrainians are doing their part. Now is the time to arm them on the scale and with the urgency needed, as in some cases we are already doing. We must throttle the Russian economy, increasing pressure on a Russian elite that does not, by and large, buy into Vladimir Putin’s bizarre ideology of “passionarity” and paranoid Great Russian nationalism. We must mobilize official and unofficial agencies to penetrate the information cocoon in which Putin’s government is attempting to insulate the Russian people from the news that thousands of their young men will come home maimed, or in coffins, or not at all from a stupid and badly fought war of aggression against a nation that will now hate them forever. We should begin making arrangements for war-crimes trials, and begin naming defendants, as we should have done during World War II. Above all, we must announce that there will be a Marshall Plan to rebuild the Ukrainian economy, for nothing will boost their confidence like the knowledge that we believe in their victory and intend to help create a future worth having for a people willing to fight so resolutely for its freedom.

[],False,,bleepblopbloopy,,,[],,,,text,t2_4lu6l,False,True,"When i visited iraq during the 2007 surge, I discovered that the conventional wisdom in Washington usually lagged the view from the field by two to four weeks. Something similar applies today. Analysts and commentators have grudgingly declared that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has been blocked, and that the war is stalemated. The more likely truth is that the Ukrainians are winning.

So why can’t Western analysts admit as much? Most professional scholars of the Russian military first predicted a quick and decisive Russian victory; then argued that the Russians would pause, learn from their mistakes, and regroup; then concluded that the Russians would actually have performed much better if they had followed their doctrine; and now tend to mutter that everything can change, that the war is not over, and that the weight of numbers still favors Russia. Their analytic failure will be only one of the elements of this war worth studying in the future.

At the same time, there are few analysts of the Ukrainian military—a rather more esoteric specialty—and thus the West has tended to ignore the progress Ukraine has made since 2014, thanks to hard-won experience and extensive training by the United States, Great Britain, and Canada. The Ukrainian military has proved not only motivated and well led but also tactically skilled, integrating light infantry with anti-tank weapons, drones, and artillery fire to repeatedly defeat much larger Russian military formations. The Ukrainians are not merely defending their strong points in urban areas but maneuvering from and between them, following the Clausewitzian dictum that the best defense is a shield of well-directed blows.

The reluctance to admit what is happening on the ground in Ukraine stems perhaps in part from the protectiveness scholars feel for their subject (even if they loathe it on moral grounds), but more from a tendency to emphasize technology (the Russians have some good bits), numbers (which they dominate, though only up to a point), and doctrine. The Russian army remains in some ways very cerebral, and intellectuals can too easily admire elegant tactical and operational thinking without pressing very hard on practice. But the war has forcibly drawn attention to the human dimension. For example, most modern militaries rely on a strong cadre of noncommissioned officers. Sergeants make sure that vehicles are maintained and exercise leadership in squad tactics. The Russian NCO corps is today, as it has always been, both weak and corrupt. And without capable NCOs, even large numbers of technologically sophisticated vehicles deployed according to a compelling doctrine will end up broken or abandoned, and troops will succumb to ambushes or break under fire.

The West’s biggest obstacle to accepting success, though, is that we have become accustomed over the past 20 years to think of our side as being stymied, ineffective, or incompetent. It is time to get beyond that, and consider the facts that we can see.

The evidence that Ukraine is winning this war is abundant, if one only looks closely at the available data. The absence of Russian progress on the front lines is just half the picture, obscured though it is by maps showing big red blobs, which reflect not what the Russians control but the areas through which they have driven. The failure of almost all of Russia’s airborne assaults, its inability to destroy the Ukrainian air force and air-defense system, and the weeks-long paralysis of the 40-mile supply column north of Kyiv are suggestive. Russian losses are staggering—between 7,000 and 14,000 soldiers dead, depending on your source, which implies (using a low-end rule of thumb about the ratios of such things) a minimum of nearly 30,000 taken off the battlefield by wounds, capture, or disappearance. Such a total would represent at least 15 percent of the entire invading force, enough to render most units combat ineffective. And there is no reason to think that the rate of loss is abating—in fact, Western intelligence agencies are briefing unsustainable Russian casualty rates of a thousand a day.

Add to this the repeated tactical blundering visible on videos even to amateurs: vehicles bunched up on roads, no infantry covering the flanks, no closely coordinated artillery fire, no overhead support from helicopters, and panicky reactions to ambushes. The 1-to-1 ratio of vehicles destroyed to those captured or abandoned bespeaks an army that is unwilling to fight. Russia’s inability to concentrate its forces on one or two axes of attack, or to take a major city, is striking. So, too, are its massive problems in logistics and maintenance, carefully analyzed by technically qualified observers.

The Russian army has committed well more than half its combat forces to the fight. Behind those forces stands very little. Russian reserves have no training to speak of (unlike the U.S. National Guard or Israeli or Finnish reservists), and Putin has vowed that the next wave of conscripts will not be sent over, although he is unlikely to abide by that promise. The swaggering Chechen auxiliaries have been hit badly, and in any case are not used to, or available for, combined-arms operations. Domestic discontent has been suppressed, but bubbles up as brave individuals protest and hundreds of thousands of tech-savvy young people flee.

If Russia is engaging in cyberwar, that is not particularly evident. Russia’s electronic-warfare units have not shut down Ukrainian communications. Half a dozen generals have gotten themselves killed either by poor signal security or trying desperately to unstick things on the front lines. And then there are the negative indicators on the other side—no Ukrainian capitulations, no notable panics or unit collapses, and precious few local quislings, while the bigger Russophilic fish, such as the politician Viktor Medvedchuk, are wisely staying quiet or out of the country. And reports have emerged of local Ukrainian counterattacks and Russian withdrawals.

The coverage has not always emphasized these trends. As the University of St. Andrews’s Phillips P. O’Brien has argued, pictures of shattered hospitals, dead children, and blasted apartment blocks accurately convey the terror and brutality of this war, but they do not convey its military realities. To put it most starkly: If the Russians level a town and slaughter its civilians, they are unlikely to have killed off its defenders, who will do extraordinary and effective things from the rubble to avenge themselves on the invaders. That is, after all, what the Russians did in their cities to the Germans 80 years ago. More sober journalism—The Wall Street Journal has been a standout in this respect—has been analytic, offering detailed reporting on revealing battles, like the annihilation of a Russian battalion tactical group in Voznesensk.

Most commentators have taken too narrow a view of this conflict, presenting it as solely between Russia and Ukraine. Like most wars, though, it is being waged by two coalitions, fought primarily though not exclusively by Russian and Ukrainian nationals. The Russians have some Chechen auxiliaries who have yet to demonstrate much effectiveness (and who lost their commander early on), may get some Syrians (who will be even less able to integrate with Russian units), and find a half-hearted ally in Belarus, whose citizens have begun sabotaging its rail lines and whose army may well mutiny if asked to invade Ukraine.

The Ukrainians have their auxiliaries, too, some 15,000 or so foreign volunteers, some probably worthless or dangerous to their allies, but others valuable—snipers, combat medics, and other specialists who have fought in Western armies. More important, they have behind them the military industries of countries including the United States, Sweden, Turkey, and the Czech Republic. Flowing into Ukraine every day are thousands of advanced weapons: the best anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles in the world, plus drones, sniper rifles, and all the kit of war. Moreover, it should be noted that the United States has had exquisite intelligence not only about Russia’s dispositions but about its intentions and actual operations. The members of the U.S. intelligence community would be fools not to share this information, including real-time intelligence, with the Ukrainians. Judging by the adroitness of Ukrainian air defenses and deployments, one may suppose that they are not, in fact, fools.

Talk of stalemate obscures the dynamic quality of war. The more you succeed, the more likely you are to succeed; the more you fail, the more likely you are to continue to fail. There is no publicly available evidence of the Russians being able to regroup and resupply on a large scale; there is plenty of evidence to the contrary. If the Ukrainians continue to win, we might see more visible collapses of Russian units and perhaps mass surrenders and desertions. Unfortunately, the Russian military will also frantically double down on the one thing it does well—bombarding towns and killing civilians.",cabc4b737aa656de2decddf96687388f802fbd4b,True,False,,,,,0,1647909212,,0,{},i1lokdu,True,t3_tjqfpz,False,True,t3_tjqfpz,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tjqfpz/why_cant_the_west_admit_that_ukraine_is_winning/i1lokdu/,1647909227,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647880412.0,
