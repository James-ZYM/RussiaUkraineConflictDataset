[],False,,Daniels_2003,,,[],,,,text,t2_44up5lts,False,False,"I doubt the Chinese are particularly afraid of drones. Attack drones lack the firepower to pose a serious threat to them. They are best suited for chipping away at the enemy's strenght, they are a force multiplier, not a war winning weapon like people on the internet, who are impressed by a few shinny explosives, make them out to be. 

The Chinese can and they will shrug off the losses they take from drones. Drones kill soldiers, they destroy tanks. They do not defeat divisions, especially if said divisions can be properly reinforced and if they have the Anti Aircraft weaponry to cause significant losses against the enemy's drone forces. The PLA tiks those boxes. 


The Chinese are not as vulnerable to defeat in detail, they do not have a fear of tactical defeats, hence they are not investing in attempting to achieve tactical supremacy.



They are constantly improving and developing new weapons, and making them in large numbers. Simply put, they aim to have the aircraft, the tanks, the artillery, the helicopters etc to fight and defeat any enemy. It sounds stupidly simple, I know. 


I don't think they count on any clever geniously planned operations. They will mass their forces and send them forth. Their soldiers will fight, and they will kill the enemy.  When more soldiers are needed, more soldiers are sent. More artillery is sent, more aircraft are sent. 

This doesn't translate to human wave tactics or anything, but put it simply they would rather make more rifles than give their soldiers body armor, because it's the rifle that kills enemy soldiers. More rifles translates to more soldiers. They want their weapons to be good, because good weapons kill enemies, and they want to have more weapons, because more weapons means more divisions you can send into battle. Anything less is deemed not a priority.

Let's start off with the rhetoric that came from western media in the opening stages of this ""special operation"" or ""invasion"" depending on which side of the fence you reside. To the Western world this would have highlighted the plight of Ukrainians, but unfortunately came at the expense of those who the media outlets pretty much referred to as ""uncivilised"". Riddle me this but I don't know how there would be an expectation of support after this from Africans.
 Furthermore, folk are being brutalised at borders during attempts at migration. Yes, there are serious issues that need to be repaired in African states instead of burdening others with the consequences, however no-one is just going to forget being brutalised. This goes without mentioning the discrimination faced by some who even have legal status in the Western suburbs. I have to say, this does not apply to all, but it adds up. Even while trying to exit Ukraine since the war, there was still energy for racism and not just to Africans.
 Additionally, going back to the colonial period, rampant cases of abuses towards African ""subjects"" have been recorded. There was exploitation on a grand scale of resources and natives to little benefit of the de-facto states of that period. In the immediate time after some of these states gained independence from their colonial overlords, there were actions from the West subverting governance of newly created states. Such subversions included assassinations of promising leaders.
 Where the West have only been able to belittle African states and their sovereignty, on the flip side, Russians have been able to offer support. When a majority of African states had been making efforts to secure their independence and freedoms which came through armed struggle with the West, support came from Russia in the form of training and materials. It has to be noted these events took place in the time of the Cold War. A number of African states had to open themselves to communist ideologies as a consequence of this support. 
 Lastly, I want to make the point in modern time when Western nations have dolling out coercive based sanctions like confetti to African states, Russians have been able to make headway in helping with development projects. This creates an environment which some of these states are amenable to Russian interests.
 On a side note the blunder with Iraqi WMD's and the Gaddafi situation makes others not too quick to give support. Recently there was outrage over biased Western media coverage of the situation in Ethiopia which even saw protests in the USA from Ethiopian migrant communities. With all this and much more I did not mention, some African states are apprehensive with their support.

At the United Nations level, most African states representatives either abstained or went against booting Russia. The reason given by some was to keep open a line of communication and mediation with both the belligerents in order to resolve the issue.

I have to include that for what may be perceived as support for Russia from Africans, there are also some Africans on the frontlines with the Ukrainians.

People do wish this event in Ukraine did not happen for various reasons including humanitarian and economic interests.

I just thought would offer something with a little more intellectual basis compared to some of the comments I have read, some of which the views  would make you think no wonder some Africans would be seen as supporting Russia.",86a5d1fc209facb258efc4700eb4a63362101ca5,True,False,,,,,0,1651779275,,0,{},i7gqfn9,False,t3_uig425,False,True,t3_uig425,/r/war/comments/uig425/african_support_for_russia/i7gqfn9/,1651779293,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1651750475.0,

A handful of Americans have been killed. Killing a bunch of innocent people from a different country than the one you hate is a pretty stupid way to protest our policies.

They have a very large army with huge reserves to be mobilised, and numbers are valued to quality of the individual. 

They put emphasis on discipline, obedience, fighting spirit and coordonation, more so than the skill level of the individual soldier. 


My impression is the following: 


The Chinese soldier is cold and disciplined. He does not have the attitude and the pretentiousness of the NATO soldier. He is not as accurate, as skilled, as fast, as fit or as well equiped as the NATO soldier, but he is better oiled and a more reliable fighter. He can be expected to keep fighting when the NATO soldier would surrender. He can be expected to obey orders which the NATO soldier would refuse. He puts the objective before himself. He is politically indoctrinated, he is sacrificial, he does not complain, he does not think twice.


The Chinese soldier better acts as a single piece in a larger puzzle. He does not need to have served alongside his fellow soldiers to be effectively integrated in his unit. He merely needs to be told what to do. 


As units, they are more agressive, they are better at fighting in harsh conditions. They are better at retaining combat effectiveness in the face of heavy losses, they are quick to rebuild their combat effectiveness once reinforced.

 They can more reliably conduct combat operations without ideal heavy fire support. 


I strongly believe, based on what I know about them, that their method of offensive operations against defended positions is the traditional supress, attack and overrun, instead of NATO's supress, overwealm, destroy and mop up. 


That means that the goal of Chinese infantry will be to reach your positions, jump in your trench and kill you with rifle fire and grenades, and the job of the Chinese heavy assets is to allow their infantry to do that. To give their infantry the necessary firepower to  supress you and to  prevent your own heavy assets from breaking their attack. 


By contrast, the NATO unit relies on their aircraft and artillery to supress and overwealm the defender, while the tanks and mobile infantry approach under the protective blanket of said assets, and engage with their own fire once in range, by which time the back of the enemy's resistance will have been broken, and most of the enemies will be killed, wounded, fleeing or surrendering. After that, the infantry moves in and mops up the last of the enemy resistance.


The NATO unit cannot mount an attack without the necesarry fire support. The Chinese unit, if they deem it important enough to break the enemy's defensive lines, can attack with less than ideal quantity of fire support, which they will make up by deploying larger amounts of infantry and armored vehicles for the attack, ensuring success trough the blood of their soldiers.",5344d3d49e9b05ea16d63d9e9631c6b18a295d86,True,False,,,,,0,1651764284,,0,{},i7fpinx,False,t3_uij8sm,False,True,t3_uij8sm,/r/war/comments/uij8sm/how_well_trained_is_the_pla/i7fpinx/,1651772379,1,False,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1651735484.0,1651765022.0
