For Ukrainian losses nobody really knows. Zelensky mentions estimates occasionally, but they sound quite a bit on the low side.

Or maybe the ratio is less extreme, since Ukrainians have proportionally more infantry and less heavy equipment. But Russian losses are definitely much higher than Ukrainian, no way around it.

Nothing Russia says is worth paying attention to.

A typical electric cars battery is enough storage capacity for several days usage of an average house. *Once every house has one* thats basically a couple of days usage for the whole grid. I live in the UK, we have 46m cars and LGVs. When they are almost all electric with a 50 Kwh battery each..... thats 2,300 *Giga* Watt Hours of storage the grid can access, for free, with the consumers willingly paying to have the storage installed in their houses. 

If they're being charged preferentially when the sun is shining, or when the wind is blowing, due to highly reactive electricity rate changes.... and the battery connectors are made to support two-way-flow.... across an entire grid you've got giga-watts of storage capacity and people *pursuing their own economic self-interest* will use them to balance the electricity between the cheap periods and the expensive periods. 

If the price varies from 5p per KwH when its sunny and windy, to 20p per KwH at night/in low wind conditions.... people will set their cars to charge when the price is low (unless the charge gets to less than 1 days commute, in which case charge at any price). That electricity charged when the renewable inputs are plentiful will be used that for driving or dischanged it to their house when the price is high.... and then you have built in large scale storage for day/night cycles, and other variances that are under a week or so (its no good for summer/winter cycles tho).

It'd certainly balance the solar day/night issue very effectively.... and may form the bulk of the ""storage bulwark"" needed for day-to-day type wind variances.

You'd have to use pumped hydro, or concrete block cranes, or other  physical energy storage mediums as well (not least for seasonal issues if you have a lot of solar)...... and you would want to have a good baseload of something like nuclear to take up the bulk of the ""always needed load"" so the renewables are just handling the variable load...... but it'd lift the strain of a lot of the day-to-day storage/load issues renewables have because ""its nighttime and the wind ain't blowing today"" those are the times people will discharge their battery into their house.... and when its sunny and windy, they'll ""fill the car up when its super cheap to do so"".

If you've got 2 days worth of 100% of the national electricity budget sitting in batteries plugged into each house..... then smoothing out a 30% total budget variance between day/night .... or a 20% total budget variance week-to-week as the wind is still this week..... is something you can handle by just ""bumping the price up to 20p per KwH until it goes away"" and a ""Super-Sunny Days with Heavy Winds"" can be easily stored up for use later by ""dropping prices to 5p per KwH until it goes away"".

The consumers will willingly pay for thousands of giga-watts of battery storage *if the batteries have wheels* .... and do a huge amount of the neccessary load balancing *if the prices give them the incentive to use those batteries for that purpose* (and the computers in the cars/houses allow them to set this up so it happens automatically, of course).",78dbbe55b637a277d20c3acea33519823c970409,True,False,,,,,0,1651792379,,0,{},i7hlbvy,False,t3_uivuq1,False,True,t1_i7hfvn9,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uivuq1/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_05_2022/i7hlbvy/,1651792393,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651763579.0,,
[],False,,VideConspectus,,,[],,,,text,t2_ftzys,False,False,"&gt; * The book “Unrestricted Warfare” (UW), published in 1999 by People’s Liberation Army officers Qiao Liangi and Wang Xiangsuiii has been thoroughly discussed and lauded by many in the West as an important document for understanding the Chinese strategic perspective. An article published in War on the Rocks went as far as to say the authors, “were about a decade and a half before their time.”1 

&gt; * The narrative that UW represents an authoritative source that provides valuable insight the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) follows is extremely problematic. 

&gt; * The book is unoriginal, not authoritative, both the authors themselves and examples from history contradict their thesis and much of the writing is designed to sound profound, but falls flat under closer examination. 

&gt; * Moreover, the authors do not provide an applicable plan for a military to follow. 

&gt; * Chapter 3 “A Classic That Deviates from the Classics” builds on the ideas of the first two chapters examining the Gulf War, particularly Operation Desert Storm, as the new paradigm for war expanding the battlefield with the use of technology. 

&gt; * The authors go on to explain the United States is ill-prepared to handle the new expanded battlefield particularly in regards to nonmilitary war and non-state actors (such as terrorist organizations) because a lack of unified strategy or command structure. 

&gt; * The authors get at the heart of implementing UW writing, “first of all, to transcend ideology. Only secondarily does it mean, when taking action, to transcend limits and boundaries when necessary, when they can be transcended, and select the most appropriate means (including extreme means).” 14 

&gt; * However, while extreme means are an option they point out that they should not be the default option. At the heart of UW is transcending limits (although they point out it does not mean there are “no limits”) and combining opportunities. 

&gt; * In the afterword of UW, the authors describe the reason they wrote the book. They write that they simply wanted to “concentrate together the concerns and thoughts each of us had over the past several decades and especially during the last ten years concerning military issues“.20 The Gulf War in particular is cited as a major event; they wanted to provide their opinion not write a textbook or guide. At no time do the authors express their desire to create a plan or stratagem for Chinese leadership to follow. They were not commissioned by the military or government to write this book (there are many books available that are commissioned by the PLA). Moreover, the publisher they used, PLA Literature and Arts Publishing House, is known for publishing military entertainment. While there is not one publisher that has sole command of what is authoritative out of the PLA, it would be extremely unlikely this particular publisher would produce something authoritative. 

&gt; * Finally, it is true that UW is talked about in China in the present day, but it seems more a 
result of just how much the United States and the West as a whole have covered the book. 

&gt; * The whole idea of the book is that war is fundamentally changed and become “unrestricted”, going beyond the sphere of the military. However, the authors correctly point out this is rarely if ever the case with this example in ancient times. 

&gt; * While the authors may want to indicate war is fundamentally changed in their thesis they make a solid argument as to why war has simply evolved as technology improved as they trace major historical changes from smokeless gunpowder to cyber-attacks. However, the authors never make a case the nature of war itself has changed. Technology simply enhances capability and lethality, but the basic idea of warfare stays the same whether you are throwing rocks or firing missiles. 

&gt; * In a now declassified document titled, “The Inauguration of Organized Political Warfare” by George F. Kennan dated April 30, 1948 on the very first page it defines political warfare as, “the employment of all the means at a nation’s command, short of war, to achieve its national objectives”.24 This sounds suspiciously like the nebulous definition the authors provide for unrestricted warfare. 

&gt; * In the academic journal Judgement and Decision Making there is an excellent article titled, “On the reception and detection of pseudo-profound bullshit”. The article defines pseudo profound bullshit as, “seemingly impressive assertions that are presented as true and meaningful, but are actually vacuous”. 26 Much of UW’s only original contributions and most defining features by the authors fall into this category. 

&gt; * Four major factors likely contributed to UW’s popularity: availability, timing, branding and confirmation bias. 

&gt; * Many of the stereotypical expectations of Chinese military strategy are met in the book involving indirect conflict and deception. 

&gt; * With China notoriously difficult to understand, this book may appear like a secret document giving a 
true insight into the mind of China. 

&gt; * The CCP leadership is not incompetent and the U.S. military and policy makers cannot gamble that China’s strategy is based on UW. 

&gt; * Understanding China and its strategic intentions is difficult. While it would be nice for China to give us all the answers in an easily accessible pdf translated into English, with UW it is simply not the case.

The class of missile that we are talking about, theater ballistic missiles, are not as large as you think they are (much smaller than ICBM).

Is it a reasonable view that the West has (at least until recently) introduced armaments somewhat slowly to reduce the likelihood of Russian escalation (i.e. a ""boil a frog slowly"" approach; in a way, this seems akin to Russia's history of ""salami slicing"")? Assuming Russia attempts to hold what they have currently, to what degree can the West control the level of Russian fatalities by metering the lethality and quantity of armaments it supplies Ukraine? Assuming the West wants to force Russia out of DPR/LPR at a moderate rate that will inexorably result in Russia leaving DPR/LPR (balancing risk of Russian escalation against Ukrainian civilian/infrastructure losses), what Russian fatality rate would that be over what timeframe?

My 2.5k Russian KIA/mo guesstimate (more than an order of magnitude greater intensity than the 2014-2021 timeframe) was what I thought might be that unsustainable Russian attrition rate since unlike the past, where DPR/LPR residents were coerced to fight on Russia's behalf, Russia would directly bear these personnel costs. If so, what timeframe would Russia be able to maintain that? You propose Russia could maintain that indefinitely; really? If so, the West seems likely to increase that attrition rate by providing armaments with greater quantity and lethality.

Hate to be that guy too, but I disagree. I think the statement that ""every Russian agrees that 90s were far more corrupt"" is false. I followed your advice and googled up [Russia Corruption Index](https://tradingeconomics.com/russia/corruption-index). TBF it doesn't cover the entire decade, but the data is ... inconclusive? Most perceptually corrupt years were 2000, 2008 and 2010, with the least corrupt 2020 (when everybody was buying Covid certificates). It's kinda all over the place, but there might be a positive trend, still not supporting the ""far more corrupt"" characterisation.

The hell of the 90s and the figure of Putin as the saviour of the nation from the horrors of chaos is a big part of the official mythos. I am not sure this picture is factual. Sure, 90s saw a giant rise in corruption, organized crime, homelessness, poverty, drug use. But I'm not sure Russia today is much better? You could buy a degree in the 90s, you can buy a degree now. You could buy your way out of a driving offence, you can do so now. You needed bribes and a ""krysha"" to do business in the 90s, and you need bribes today. Drugs were a gigantic problem then, they are a gigantic problem now (just today there was a video of a person dying of an overdose on the street https://t.me/dvachannel/91083). The only thing I am sure everyone will agree on is organised crime. But that's not exactly corruption, right?

Era of PRC minimum deterrence is over, I'm deeply skeptical of future where US will develop and roll out sufficient ABM umbrella to protect CONUS that PRC can't simply out build. Most assessments of RU-UKR conflict has affirmed PRC's  desire to enhance / establish parity nukes buildup for deterrence in TW scenario. But this one reaches for the stars and spend too many paragraphs on US can crush escalation dominance by eroding nuclear deterrence and securing nuclear supremacy. IMO proposal is hopium if central struts of the strategy is to win nuclear arms race 2.0 and erode MAD, as if that would not be aggressively countered.

On victory denial, the assumption is PRC victory can only be fait accompli, when CCP can calibrate victory based on domestic politics. I'm of the opinion a TW blockade and quarantining island after disarming it via air campaign without any boots on ground can be spung as victory in future. Sentiments will continue to shift cross strait, increasingly few subscribes to possibility of amicable east/west Germany reunification anymore, eventually subsuming TW as Palestine tier appendage will (have to) suffice, even if it means reducing TW to Palestine. Rich history of calamitous Chinese civil wars to rationalize such things.

Finally, the overarching PRC consideration of any TW scenario is the flip side of this article, PRC denial strategy against US intervention. And historically, I would argue victory conditions for TW cannot be divorced from PRC ""triumph"" over US meddling. If PRC can sufficiently deter US intervention with nukes, and a broader war with conventional build up, then it doesn't matter if TW is fait accompli - deterring mighty US military intervention in PRC domestic issues is as much of a significant political victory. As long as that's achievable, which PRC is building towards, then PRC has leisure to pursue wide range of TW strategies and victory conditions.

The increasing lethality of fire support and increasing perceptiveness of IRSAT assets has created a form of war where targets can be identified and quickly destroyed at minimal cost to the “hunter”. This has changed the balance between shock (overwhelming the enemy with huge forces to make them lose nerve and retreat) and fire decisively in favor of the latter. In WW2, the two worked in harmony - huge forces were required to perform “reconnaissance in force” and identify the enemy by actually fighting him. Today, drones, signals intelligence or a small team with excellent optics can identify even the best concealed enemies without giving away their own positions. This has posed huge problems for the shock based armies of the past, especially since many fire support assets are area of effect and inflict disproportionate losses on concentrated enemies.

At present all competent armies have essentially shifted to a model where infantry and armor perform a mix of small scale aggressive actions and recon in force missions, the former relying on speed and dispersion to avoid casualties. Assault breaker 2 is little more than the natural reaction to an enemy forming a mass in an age of dispersion and recon-strike.

As for how this applies to American and Chinese multi domain concepts, the two both employ recon-strike but in different ways. In the American concept, recon-strike is primary and attack is secondary. In the Chinese concept, attack is primary and recon-strike is secondary. Both armies have large long range strike capabilities, but China also has a mass of direct fire support assets in its infantry battalions and plans for them to get in close and win man to man firefights even if they lose the “long ranged war”.",c7afb1a8629715455ca104384bf96e48f2ebdbeb,True,False,,,,,0,1651778218,,0,{},i7gnr2x,False,t3_uik9pj,False,True,t3_uik9pj,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uik9pj/assault_breaker_2_and_the_unfolding_events_in/i7gnr2x/,1651778230,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651749418.0,,

Some will no doubt take a ""if Ukraine's happy, we're happy"" approach, or may be satisfied with a cease fire, but others will likely take a harder line.

While a lot has been done to train and assist Ukraine for the last 8 years, I doubt that they really have enough western-style experience to plan and enact something so integrated. They plainly lack the native sensor/intelligence infrastructure to do so.

I think you're being a little generous with how complex the Ukrainian defense has been so far. I suspect, in essence, what is happening, is western intelligence is being passed to the Ukrainians on a piece-by-piece basis. There is no ""reconnaissance strike complex"" because the west has not truly integrated its intelligence with Ukraine in real time. Plainly, this is more just an old fashioned intelligence advantage.

Case in point: A Ukrainian Javelin team can only really benefit so much from strategic intelligence. Javelin's can't directly receive targeting data; the soldiers on the ground have to receive the info by radio, and then the troops still have to move to a position where they can observe and engage the targets themselves. There are a LOT of opportunities for mistakes and lost time here. This is ""networked"" in the absolutely most loose definition.

To be more fair to your argument, however,  I think what we are seeing is the ""image"" of assault breaker. Western weapons are designed to destroy massed armor, and western intelligence is designed to detect and track those massed forces.

&gt;At the risk of sounding conspiratorial, I suspect that the Biden admin holds a grudge against Putin for election interference and the Hunter Biden story and views this as a great opportunity to potentially remove him from power.

I'll keep repeating this till the day I die. Biden could not give a rat's ass about Ukraine. He wants to go back to concentrating on domestic issues and ukraine is a huge distraction. The events leading up to the war were CIA and state department led, including all the intelligence shared, which even then the Whitehouse insisted it be delayed by 1 hour so as to not be ""real time"". The weapons shared initially were really the least amount the US can supply without looking completely apathetic. When the UK, whose armed forces budget is smaller than the entire USMC, has shared more than half of the hardware you've sent, that's saying something. And for the longest time Biden refused to share armored vehicles or artillery and even prevented Poland from sending MiGs.

All of Biden's reluctance is gone now. I think his visit to the refugee camp in Poland really affected him as well as how popular helping Ukraine is domestically (huge props to Zelensky for playing that crowd well).

&gt; The RKG-3 (pictured) is an anti-tank grenade designed in the Soviet Union that was first introduced in 1950. The weapon is the size and weight of a slender bottle of wine and made to be thrown by hand at enemy armored vehicles.

[],False,,an_actual_lawyer,,,[],,,,text,t2_6pvo3,False,True,"&gt; Unless the Russians were looking to take over the entire of Ukraine, that move made no sense - unless it was a feint. Now, I have recently read elsewhere that this ""feint"" concept is wrong because (1) it (the move towards Kyiv) was too heavy to be a feint, (2) because the Russians lost a lot of personnel and equipment in the process. But I am not convinced. This is because of two reasons: (1) It is difficult to understand how and under what circumstances Russia could have convinced itself that it could take over all of Ukraine. It makes more sense for them to concentrate on the eastern and south eastern part of Ukraine because not only are the inhabitants relatively well-disposed towards them but also because those are some of the richest areas in the Ukraine. (2) More importantly, Russian strategists would have had to know that a grab attempt of the whole of Ukraine would necessarily provoke NATO and the US and that would be counterproductive to their strategic aims. It could have been possible that they assumed that the capture of Ukraine would have been an easy job, but they could not have failed to learn from the problems that the US faced in Iraq and Afghanistan when it's pacification programs failed and they had to withdraw. So a sharp limited war with limited objectives would make more sense. Put differently, the operation against Kyiv does not make sense unless it is seen either as an expression of an insane and misguided plan OR as a feint with the specific objective to tie down Ukrainian forces in that area while initiating operations in the East and South East to achieve the real objectives.
&gt; 

This is not difficult for me at all.  Putin is surrounded by yes men who don't give opinions counter to the group opinion.  Everyone decided Ukraine was full of evil people who wouldn't fight, with the exception of a few hardcore Nazi groups such as Azov.  No one said ""wait, they've been training with NATO for almost 6 years and seem to have made strides, perhaps they will stand and fight?""

When you combine this with the successful ""green men"" invasion of Crimea and the separatist areas, where local leaders were essentially bought by Russia, it makes sense that Putin would believe that Ukraine's leadership would either be bought or would flee with suitcases or a plane full of money.  Russia thought Zelensky would flee 99 out of 100 times - the drive toward Kyiv was designed to scare him into fleeing if the quick strike special forces operation failed at the airport, with the backup goal being to just drive into Kyiv over light resistance.",67565047c9331fcf1e5548c2782b253b9186cbbe,True,False,,,,,0,1651765007,,0,{},i7frckf,False,t3_uik9pj,False,True,t1_i7dufka,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uik9pj/assault_breaker_2_and_the_unfolding_events_in/i7frckf/,1651772271,2,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651736207.0,,

&gt; 

This is absolutely one of the keys to UA success.  They deserve credit for ballin' on a budget, but Russia's military has apparently been a shell for a few decades, both in terms of equipment and leadership.

&gt;The early days of the war seemed to leave Ukraine in shock and in places without heavily fortified regular forces the Russians seemed to drive mostly unrestricted deep into the country. The leadership in Kyiv has often been criticized for not mobilizing sooner and a failure to block roads with mines and demo bridges. This is unfair I think as the leadership was trying to not panic the country and send the economy reeling and therefore provide Putin a victory without ever firing a shot. But it does seem that the early days was a happy time of kilometers made by the Russians in several areas.

I think there are valid criticism's of Ukraine's preparations, but they prepared where it mattered most:  (1) Hardening against cyber attacks; (2) Turning Russian intelligence operations into a clown show; and (3) Keeping key assets such as fighters, SAM batteries, etc. moving so they couldn't be targeted. 


&gt;My personal take on many of these developments is that information for targeting is getting better, cheaper, and more widely available to adversaries. And the ability to hit and kill these sensitive things with advanced missile tech is a hard lesson that the US is going to have to learn. Dispersing and moving forces to avoid devastating early attacks is going to vital in any future conflict.

Another outstanding point.  Missile defense would seem to be a key for any static infrastructure, at least in terms of protecting against peer and near-peer adversaries.",f21c921f369559e9ba2c6ee352a1344b953fc3e1,True,False,,,,,0,1651764661,,0,{},i7fqgzd,False,t3_uik9pj,False,True,t1_i7ddna6,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uik9pj/assault_breaker_2_and_the_unfolding_events_in/i7fqgzd/,1651772320,2,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651735861.0,,

There are plenty of kids who have served conscription or ex army in taiwan. Go and ask them.

Easy to write on a poll. Even then its only 50% lol. Go to taiwan. Talk to people there. Maybe u will understand more. Taiwan is filled with mainlanders and vice versa.

Its not unusual for family to fight about politics at the dinner table. You really think they're willing to die and kill each other? Life is too comfortable now to die for something so dumb.

Losing a civil war and not getting your way is very different to being invaded by a foreign country. Yeah you dont get your way but please dont compare it to being invaded lol.

If this was the case then the US wouldn't be doing all it could to force china into making its own chips.

For years US policy has encouraged countries to seek alternate methods less dependent on the US and which the US can't control to throw its weight around and enforce its will on others unilaterally.

I think you're giving long term strategic considerations way too much credit. Mostly it's about short term internal politicking and various groups looking out for their perceived self interest. The US is scared of losing its unipolar hegemonic role and is throwing its weight around in ever more divisive ways without giving any consideration to the wider consequences.

----
&gt;It doesnt mean 65% are willing to die for independence. They arent desperate to be independent despite what we call ""lip service"".

To be clear, Taiwan IS already independent from the PRC...

Also according to polls, 77% of adults are willing to fight in the event of an invasion by the PRC...

[Taiwan Center for International Strategic Studies and the Taiwan International Studies Association](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2020/10/25/2003745764) poll:
&gt;Asked about their willingness to defend national security, 66 percent of respondents said that they would fight for Taiwan if a cross-strait war breaks out in the wake of Taiwan declaring independence, while 26.1 percent said they would not, the survey showed.
&gt;
&gt;**When facing an invasion by China, the ratio of people willing to fight for the nation rose to 77.6 percent**, and that of opponents fell to 15.9 percent, it showed.

[Poll conducted by National Chengchi University,](https://thediplomat.com/2019/03/are-taiwans-citizens-willing-to-fight-against-china/) from The Diplomat Magazine:

&gt;We asked 1001 Taiwanese respondents above 20 years old: **“Is there a casualty threshold beyond which you will consider the conflict (with China) is not worth the trouble?”** Subjects chose from six options: 1) 0 deaths; 2) 1 – 50 deaths; 3) 51 – 500 deaths; 4) 501–5,000 deaths; 5) 5,001–50,000 deaths; and  6) over 50,000 deaths.
&gt;
&gt;**The most popular categories were over 50,000 deaths (32.2 percent)** and 0 deaths (20 percent), whereas 51-500 deaths (7.7 percent) and 5,001-50,000 (9.9 percent) are the least selected options. The result is surprising, as there is not a linear association between battle deaths and Taiwanese tolerance of war. Existing studies on American support for war overseas have often pointed out that the higher the number of deaths, the less popular the war. Such a pattern is non-existent in Taiwan.
&gt;
&gt;According to the poll, about one-fifth of the population is completely opposed to war (not willing to tolerate a single death), **but many more were also willing to endure quite a significant number of fatalities (50,000).** This number is even higher than American support for the military mission in Iraq early 2003 (when public support for the mission was still high). At that time, only 11 percent of the public would tolerate a casualty threshold of 50,000.",32fcd6aa59660e233494d91358a3374b9f08d32f,True,False,,,,,0,1651762383,,0,{},i7fkrjq,False,t3_uigw3g,False,True,t1_i7e1c54,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uigw3g/deterring_china_a_victory_denial_strategy_the/i7fkrjq/,1651762396,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651733583.0,,

[],False,,Peace-Bone,,,[],,,,text,t2_7efzc7q5,False,False,"Okay, first of all: Russia/Putin doesn't need to win this war. They don't even really need to continue it. Putin's legitimacy is in no way staked on winning this war. If the entire invasion is utterly routed and they lose Donbas and Crimea then that would not really threaten him. He totally has the option of flat out withdrawing today and he'd be fine.

Could he be assassinated suddenly or overthrown at any time? Yeah, but there's no clear line between losing and Ukraine and getting killed. He's not some elected official who came in on promises of conquering Ukraine, nor a warlord who's government is built around constant conquest. It's based on constant control of the opposition to make them ineffectual, assassination of any actual threats, constant undermining of any sort of faith in democracy, stuff like that.

Putin's supporters were saying that there would be no invasion until the moment it happened. And if they pulled out tomorrow, the Russian government could say that they totally won and killed all the nazis and everything is great. Their supporters would say that it's a brilliant tactical move and meant to do it the whole time and they won anyway so shut up. All the issues that come about would be used as more justifications to crack down on anything resembling dissent.

Am I saying Putin's invincible? No, he's not. But there's no real direct line connection between losing in Ukraine and losing power in Russia. At this point it's way more likely he'll die of being super old.

And second: Full mobilization would not help. A lot of people meme about Russia shoving guns in people's hands and throwing them out there, and with the sheer stupidity on display, I'm starting to think that Russian leaders have been convinced that this is a tactic. It's just not. If you want anything resembling a solider who will contribute more than literally nothing, you need like six months of training, you need equipment and money to feed them, to arm them, and to run the logistics to get them anywhere remotely meaningful. 

If Russia called up two million soldiers and tried to give them all guns and throw them out there, it wouldn't even be a mob charging Ukraine, it would be a logistical crisis of even trying to get them to Ukraine at all, at which point it would be a mass execution. People don't appreciate logistics. Simply having hundreds of people in one place needs tons of organization, planning, money. Moving them to another place takes even more, giving them equipment takes even more, expecting them to use it takes even more, making it more people takes even more, and so on and so on.

What's more likely is that there will be some kind of partial mobilization to bolster up manpower losses. Call in internal troops that haven't moved yet, more recent conscripts, dudes with military skills that aren't in the military, police officers, security guys of all kind. It'll get them thousands of more troops, but at best, they could get back to an inferior version of their starting invasion force, cause they're still missing tons of equipment they can't replace. It's sure as hell not enough to open up a *new* front.

Although, it would be really darkly hilarious to watch them try. If they try for the 'conscript everyone' strategy, it would be a humanitarian disaster of Russians dying en masse in poorly funded training, poorly organized deployment, and then getting blown up in Ukraine. If they go for opening up a new front, congratulations, they have now stretched Russian forces slim sacrificing the few advantages they had.

Really, Russia's best move is to make a slow withdraw to February borders while they still have the strength to defend those lines. Ukraine would accept ceasefire, but they can't join NATO or the EU with an ongoing territorial dispute. Then Russian media declares their total victory, and things continue to be kind of bad in Russia.",5637360c6731320df74fdde53fcd3d6f297fc4e4,True,False,,,,,0,1651759652,,0,{},i7fe51w,False,t3_uivuq1,False,True,t1_i7ezopf,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uivuq1/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_05_2022/i7fe51w/,1651759669,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651730852.0,,

You're not going to get that sort of information from an active war zone, and I don't keep lists of everything I read on Twitter. But throughout the conflict I've seen notices they're recruiting generally, that they're recruiting artillerymen specifically, and that they were blowing up a railway bridge somewhere. The need for artillerymen specifically suggests a rather large operation.

&gt;This is a very sly way to say that they are still fascists. 

You're wrong twice here.

The first way you're wrong is that you're assuming they have a uniform political identity, as if political beliefs are a litmus test for joining Azov. There's no reason to believe that.

The second way you're wrong is that you're conflating nationalists and fascists. Political beliefs are a spectrum, and fascists are different than nationalists.

Nationalists are still problematic in my view, but equating them with fascists is ignorant.

&gt;You need keep up to date. [ISW have reported that Russia has stormed the steel plant last night and is operating freely inside the facility. ](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-may-4)

Ukraine has communication restored with Azovstal and reports the situation is stable. ISW was reporting the fall of Azovstal within days a month ago. Nobody has enough information there to really understand the situation.

&gt;[Reports published by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) have connected the Azov Battalion to war crimes such as mass looting, unlawful detention, and torture.[160][161] An OHCHR report from March 2016 stated that the organization had “collected detailed information about the conduct of hostilities by Ukrainian armed forces and the Azov regiment in and around Shyrokyne (31km east of Mariupol), from the summer of 2014 to date. Mass looting of civilian homes was documented, as well as targeting of civilian areas between September 2014 and February 2015](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azov_Battalion).

That's all outdated because it predates Azov's reorganization and absorption into the Ukrainian armed forces.

-----------------

The inner workings of the US and South Korean alliance and the steps taken by SK to counter North Korea's conventional and nonconventional weapons is not something that you get to read about everyday. As the authors state this is  ""...a topic that has been long shrouded in ambiguity and largely ignored by the academic community."" 

If SK was developing these capabilities without the North being dominant in press coverage; then it would be a major news story, and a major topic in the study of security issues. The amount of money and resources spent by SK on the conventional abilities to hold NKs deterrent at risk, and to kill its leader, is remarkable. 

This paper is by far the best I have ever read on the issue and by reading it, it will give you a better understanding of many other issues like; readiness of airpower, the utility of stealth aircraft like the F-35, the time for SK to break out with its own nuclear weapon capability, the give and take of the US-SK relationship, the proliferation of ballistic and cruise missile technology, NK nuclear weapons, the security of Kim Jong-un in a conflict, the destabilizing affect of short range ballistic missiles, and a few more that I am forgetting at the moment. 

The point is that an article like this will give the reader far more knowledge of security issues than just the main topic listed in the title. I highly recommend it.",6d55117aa7c672600f796747b6857e8e7d73a99e,True,False,,,,,0,1651758863,,0,{},i7fcav5,True,t3_uixj8f,False,True,t1_i7fa18n,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uixj8f/conventional_counterforce_dilemmas_south_koreas/i7fcav5/,1651758878,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651730063.0,,

&gt; * …military planners in Seoul are facing a dire challenge, as they seek to secure South Korea under the strain of both North Korea's nuclear threat and an intensified fear of abandonment by the United States.

&gt; * This article sheds light on South Korea's military response to this challenge, a topic that has been long shrouded in ambiguity and largely ignored by the academic community.

&gt; * What is South Korea's strategy for managing the dual threats of a nuclear North Korea and potential U.S. abandonment?

&gt; * South Korea is operationalizing an independent conventional counterforce strategy, or offensive and defensive measures designed to destroy or deplete the nuclear forces of an adversary.

&gt; * To bolster deterrence, South Korea is also threatening countervalue strikes, seeking to hold the North Korean leadership at risk. 

&gt; * This strategy is unique. Few, if any, nonnuclear states have sought to rely on advanced conventional capabilities to deter a nuclear-armed adversary.5 

&gt; * Although South Korea is developing this strategy within the framework of its alliance with the United States, the ultimate goal is a fully independent operational capability.

&gt; * We argue that South Korea's approach should be understood as both a short- and long-term hedge against U.S. abandonment.

&gt; * Many of the capabilities South Korea is acquiring or considering—particularly advanced ballistic and cruise missiles—will shorten the time frame for development of a credible nuclear deterrent.

&gt; * Developing the capability to threaten the North Korean nuclear arsenal based solely on conventional weapons is difficult and places major demands on the South Korean military.

&gt; * The overall strategy rests on both a deterrence by denial and punishment logic. South Korea believes it will enhance deterrence by raising within the minds of the North Korean leadership the possibilities of attack failure and significant retaliation. 

&gt; * We demonstrate how South Korea's new capabilities may function as a hedge, namely by providing a stopgap deterrent if the U.S. alliance fails in the short term, while over the longer term providing South Korea with strengthened nuclear latency. This fits within a long-standing strategy of hedging against U.S. abandonment, and we argue that the United States has—somewhat counterintuitively—largely supported this approach.

&gt; * As North Korea is close to or has developed the ability to strike the continental United States with nuclear weapons, fears of alliance abandonment have increased in South Korea.27 While clichéd, the question of whether Washington would sacrifice a West Coast city for Seoul remains pertinent in the minds of South Korean decisionmakers. 

&gt; * The United States largely has supported South Korea's efforts to develop greater capabilities and is not necessarily opposed to its hedging behavior. Following the sinking of the Cheonan and the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island, South Korea and the United States sought to alter their traditional and largely passive deterrence policy. Through this process, the United States agreed— despite the Barack Obama administration's initial skepticism—to revise missile guidelines and allow South Korea to build more potent ballistic and cruise missiles.30

&gt; * In addition, South Korean leaders realize, while refusing to fully network their missile defense systems with the U.S. forces, that combined forces provide a more credible deterrent.36 

&gt; * …South Korea is progressively drawing closer to its goal of obtaining an independent conventional counterforce and countervalue capability. As South Korea strengthens these capabilities, it will no longer be dependent on the United States to initiate counterforce strikes. 

&gt; * South Korea's reliance on the United States is declining. South Korea is thus approaching a point where it could employ its strategy without U.S. support.

&gt; * In a scenario where the alliance has ended, U.S. forces have left the peninsula, or the United States is unwilling to commit to the use of force, South Korea's counterforce capabilities would provide a stopgap deterrent.

&gt; * Rather, the key problem for South Korea is the credibility of its capabilities.40 As we outline in detail below, there are daunting challenges facing South Korea's operationalization of its deterrence strategy. Its ability to preemptively destroy the North Korean arsenal and retaliate in the event of an attack are far from assured.

&gt; * South Korean threats to retaliate and kill North Korean leaders are minimally credible, as the mere possibility of such strikes may be enough to instill uncertainty. South Korea's retaliatory strategy resembles nuclear strategies premised on “first-strike uncertainty,” which rests on a state's ability to make its opponent uncertain about whether it could prevent retaliation after a nuclear attack. Although less effective than a secure second-strike capability, such capabilities nevertheless may have a deterrent effect.42

&gt; * South Korea's advanced conventional capabilities may also provide a longer-term hedge by bolstering its nuclear latency. If the U.S. alliance broke down, South Korea would arguably be likely to seek to develop nuclear weapons.

&gt; * South Korea has for several decades pursued a nuclear hedging strategy. It had a nuclear weapons program during the 1970s (abandoned in large part because of U.S. pressure), and a majority of the South Korean public favors developing nuclear weapons to respond to the North Korean threat.44

&gt; * Even if North Korea only sought to engage in a limited preventive strike, its leaders would have to consider the risk of escalation into a full-blown conflict, where South Korea could attempt to hold its leaders at risk.

&gt; *  …the missiles South Korea is developing would greatly ease South Korea's path to deliverable and survivable nuclear weapons.

&gt; * South Korea's nascent drive to acquire a nuclear-powered attack submarine to hold North Korean missile submarines at risk also may be driven partly by a nuclear hedging logic.53 The most important hurdle South Korea would face were it to build the bomb is a lack of access to the technology necessary to produce weapons-grade fissile material.54 To produce fuel for a submarine, South Korea would need the ability to enrich uranium. Some analysts therefore believe that the country's plans are at least partly informed by a desire for enrichment technology.55 

&gt; * …as many as 200 launchers and more than 1,000 missiles, most of which are nuclear capable.64 As it would be highly challenging to ascertain which missiles carried nuclear warheads, South Korea would likely be forced to take out all of them.65

&gt; * Finally, the regime in Pyongyang has constructed thousands of hardened underground shelters around the country.66

&gt; * …North Korea now could launch a ballistic missile in about twelve minutes.69 

&gt; * One South Korean news report suggested that South Korea's goal was to have 1,700 ballistic and cruise missiles by 2017 and more than 2,000 by the 2020s.78 This, in theory, would allow South Korea to destroy 70 percent of North Korea's long-range artillery and missiles within twenty-four hours of a conflict starting.79

&gt; * Even if South Korea had sufficient missiles, numbers alone are not a good indicator of capability. Instead, the key variable is readiness: ease and time of deployment and clarity of C2 procedures determine effectiveness. 

&gt; * As the preceding analysis showed, for South Korea to establish a credible counterforce capability is technically and operationally challenging. The arms race instability it almost certainly will create on the Korean Peninsula compounds these challenges. Arms race instability refers to a situation in which states race for new arms because they fear the other side is developing capabilities that might enable a preemptive or preventive attack.96 South Korea's strategy gives North Korea strong incentives to race for new weapons to ensure the survivability and penetrability of the North Korean nuclear arsenal.

&gt; * South Korea's key problem is that offensive nuclear capabilities are easier and less expensive to develop than the conventional capabilities designed to stop them.98

&gt; * A further broad challenge springing from South Korea's strategy is its potential negative impact on crisis stability. Crisis stability refers to situations in which one or both parties have limited reason to fear a preemptive or a premediated attack, and thus limited incentives to strike first in a conflict.103 

&gt; * This study's findings have several important implications for contemporary discussions about the theory of the “nuclear revolution,” which maintains that the dominance of nuclear second-strike strategies have altered the nature of warfare and international relations more broadly.116 

&gt; * …as James Acton recently argued, the increasing entanglement between nuclear and conventional weapons is likely to lead to increasing risks of inadvertent escalation in the future.121

&gt; * Even if they are primarily a hedge against a nuclear-armed North Korea and U.S. abandonment, South Korea's increasingly challenging security environment puts a premium on these capabilities in other contexts as well. They provide South Korea with additional conventional options against a rising China, and their development indicates that Seoul will not automatically bandwagon with Beijing in an abandonment scenario, but rather seek to preserve its autonomy.",9be4306bb1565a11b4518c499984227a5a57c8b2,True,False,,,,,0,1651757849,,0,{},i7fa18n,True,t3_uixj8f,False,True,t3_uixj8f,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uixj8f/conventional_counterforce_dilemmas_south_koreas/i7fa18n/,1651757867,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651729049.0,,

I have a pet theory that the existence of Taiwan is far more useful to the CCP as a propaganda tool/ source of a common nationalist narrative than it is as chinese territory.

But yes it's a bit ridiculous how much we emphasise taiwan as dominating the whole of chinese internal discourse. I couldn't even find any sort of public sentiment polling from the chinese public towards taiwan, but it wouldn't surprise me if on the whole they're largely indifferent.

The CCP's power is based on an implicit agreement whereby people are happy to work together for a 'common cause' and accept reduced political freedoms so long as they perceive the government to be working in their interest and improving their lives. If the CCP say 'we have no choice but to invade taiwan' then people will go probably along with it. If they completely shift the narrative over time and say 'we don't need taiwan' then again people will probably go along with it. A war that devastates the chinese economy/ quality of life poses FAR more risk to the CCP than a failure to conquer taiwan IMO.

Your view would be a perfect fit if this was a less corrupt, more competent nation.

I believe that the erosion of institutions and concentration of power allowed Putin to plan and execute the operation in a way that bypassed the General Staff almost entirely, therefore stumbling into the obviously avoidable clusterfucks that characterise the conflict. I think he was fed over-optimistic intelligence assessments that signaled a Crimea-like takeover of the entire nation was doable. In order to achieve the element of surprise that made 2014 successful, the plan was hatched in secrecy, within an echo chamber that failed to appreciate the grave risks involved. They did not expect an insurgency, nor the West rallying behind Ukraine. They did not expect careful *military* planning or even C2 to be required to achieve their objectives: a mere show of force, some paratroopers landing on pivotal locations and some armored vehicles cruising to Maidan, coincident with the activation of covert assets, would be all that was required to topple this house of cards. 

In early February I shared that view, and believed that the Ukrainian nation would fold in days with nothing more than token, sporadic resistance -- I had swallowed the propaganda whole, as it turns out. But what I failed to appreciate then was that none of what Putin has publicly stated since Autumn were actually meant to sound ludicrous. I think they truly believed everything they said, from Ukraine being a non-nation whose people yearned to be liberated, to the entire venture being a ""special military operation"" that was orchestrated not by the General Staff, but by Kremlin directly.

I would even hazard that the build-up prior to the invasion was much delayed, that perhaps the operation was envisioned to be conducted with a relatively small number of high-readiness forces during the winter months; perhaps the invasion was so delayed as during the deployments more and more military leaders were clued into the plan, and these men closer to the ground were able to offer some resistance about the feasibility of what they were being asked to do.

[In Ukraine, Corruption Is Now Undermining the Military
 | The NY Times | 2018](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/world/europe/ukraine-corruption-military.html)

Leadership made a decision to work towards NATO standards.

[The Ukrainian Military: From Degradation to Renewal | Foriegn Policy Research Institute | 2018](https://www.fpri.org/article/2018/08/the-ukrainian-military-from-degradation-to-renewal/)

""Although we often refer to this process as “reform,” it would be more accurate to speak of the creation of a new military. Changes have taken place in all spheres—from strategic defense documents to management to logistics. Most significantly, Ukraine has officially declared NATO membership a strategic state goal, thus abandoning its two-decades-long multi-vector policy of cooperation with both NATO and Russia. It has altered the management of its armed forces—i.e., personnel training, logistics, and medical support—accordingly to achieve compatibility with NATO member states.

The government has also increased its budget for the military, which is receiving more funds than at any time since independence. Whereas in 2013 Ukraine’s military budget amounted to approximately 1.9 billion dollars, in 2015, it was 3.1 billion dollars. Of course, it is hard to say that any amount of funding is sufficient when facing Russia. Nonetheless, funds are flowing not only toward the maintenance of the armed forces, but also toward the development of new capabilities.

Increased funding has helped Ukraine significantly boost both the volume and combat-readiness of its troops. Since 2013, the number of military personnel has risen 36% to 250,000. This is particularly notable as the Ukrainian army gradually abandons its unpopular draft and moves to a contract service model. According to official plans (it was approved in 2017), by 2020, up to 80% of servicemen will be professional soldiers. At the same time, the Ukrainian military has also begun conducting numerous exercises with the support of foreign states to enhance the level of combat training of personnel. In 2016 alone, the Ukrainian military held nearly 900 exercises, including those with international participation. For comparison, in 2009, zero full-scale multinational military exercises in the territory of Ukraine were conducted due to lack of funding. Thus, in case of resumption of the active phase of hostilities in the Donbas, the Ukrainian army will be more effective than in 2014 because of the combination of its own combat experience and the technologies and experience of the military from NATO countries.

Last, the military has created units for information and psychological special operations and has reformed its territorial defense system. Today, in each region of the state, formed units of territorial defense are based on reservists, volunteers, and demobilized soldiers. By the end of this year, these units will be reorganized into battalions and consolidated into brigades, which will be managed by the command of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of the Ukraine. The next stage will be the training of brigades in accordance with the standards of the NATO.""

Then they worked their asses off and made it happen with a bunch of help from other countries.  

[How Ukraine went from a corrupt army ""in ruins"" to one that amazed the world | Univision | 2022](https://www.univision.com/univision-news/world/ukraine-military-reform-us-assistance-russia-invasion)

""Collins, and other military experts, attribute the astonishing turn around to a “herculean effort” in barely six years by Ukrainian military leaders, coupled with millions of dollars of training and military equipment from an international group of countries, led by the United States, along with the U.K., Canada, Germany and Lithuania.

In 2014, Ukraine’s defense minister said the country had 6,000 combat-ready troops. Today, Ukraine’s army numbers around 170,000 active duty troops, as well as 100,000 reservists and volunteer Territorial Defense Forces.

“Boy they were motivated to defend their country and they were taking the steps to develop,” said retired Major General Tim McGuire, who was deputy commander of U.S. Forces in Europe from 2016-2018.""

Part of the reason the Russia was able to capture the Crimea and the so-called Donbas region in the south-east was that Ukraine’s army relied on untrained conscripts with little training and experience. Things could have been worse had not thousands of volunteers, and militias helped in the war effort.

In 2016, then-president Petro Poroshenko asked for senior defense advisors from the U.S., Canada, the UK, Lithuania and Germany to advise the country on how to bring its armed forces up to NATO standards.

Gen John Abizaid, the former head of U.S. forces in the Middle East, was appointed as advisor to Ukraine’s Defense Ministry. To assist him, Abizaid picked Collins, a decorated former U.S. Army Special Operations commander who served in Iran and Afghanistan before becoming director of the Modern War Institute at West Point, the nation’s top military academy.

The U.S. had been conducting training exercises with Ukraine for a number of years, with names like Sea Breeze and Rapid Trident. But the intensity dramatically picked up, with up to five battalion (roughly 400-500 men each) being trained a year.

Since 2014, U.S. military advisers have trained more than 27,000 Ukrainian soldiers, U.S. officials say. Training included everything from “basic fundamentals” to the importance of camouflage and dispersion tactics and cyber operations.

It also included training for Ukrainian units at the Joint Multinational Training Center in Hohenfels, Germany. “That's where we do our realistic, largescale training exercises replicating the rigors of combat,” said McGuire.

An entire Special Forces branch was created from scratch. Training was done at tactical troop level to senior advisors within ministries.

“ The ultimate mission of the Green Berets is train the trainers. Their job is to work with indigenous forces. That's their classic mission. And I think what you're watching in Ukraine is how that mission truly paid off,” said Roger Pardo-Maurer, a former Special Forces officer who was also the top official for Latin America at the Pentagon. “Our tactics, our training, our organization, our system, our weapons, they picked it all up,” he added.

“Our fighter pilots have been telling everyone for years that the Ukrainian Air Force is pretty good,” the head of the California National Guard, Maj Gen David Baldwin, said in a recent interview after hosting Zelensky at a California Air National Guard base in September.

Over time, the Ukrainian armed forces established their own trainers the U.S. and its allies took on a more advisory role. The Ukrainians also gradually acquired what McGuire called “the intangibles that I believe are really what sets a military apart - the importance of professionalism, of discipline, of leadership, of initiative in the chain of command.”

“At the end of the day, it comes back down to the equipment only works if you've got a disciplined, well-trained, well-led, motivated military that can use it,” he added.

Western military teaching encourages lower ranking troop commanders to use their initiative in order to be ready to give expedient battlefield orders when necessary.

“The training and advice spread to every level, pretty much across the board,” said Collins. “This cultural shift, combined with eight years of fighting (southern separatists) in the Donbas, has created a generation of combat-ready officers,” he added.

The formation of Territorial Defense Forces in Ukraine, has also boosted morale, as well as valuable human intelligence in towns and villages.""",af70536e102558a10b7e2df9aec118004c97b3d7,True,False,,,,,0,1651756205,,0,{},i7f6iae,False,t3_uivuq1,False,True,t1_i7f4mkf,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uivuq1/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_05_2022/i7f6iae/,1651756220,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651727405.0,,

Disagree. People who think they planned to occupy all of ukraine are being silly. They were well aware that NATO had spent years training and arming ukraine. Also that occupation isn't plausible due to the level of hostility that exists, especially in the west.

At the same time a feint also doesn't make sense either.

*Maybe* they were hoping that there'd be so much armour they wouldn't be attacked, but they could also distract a significant amount of forces from the eastern front, but it doesn't really fit with what happened. 

Assuming reports are correct (a big assumption), they were hoping for a multiple pronged attack.

A. The size of the column would inspire fear in the 'newer' ukrainian troops leading to them saying 'fuck this' and cowering/running.

B. There would be defections or surrenders from various entities within the ukrainian army, some of whom had been 'paid off' beforehand. 

C. Their spec ops people could create chaos within Kiev, and they could capture Zelensky himself, leading to a collapse in morale and maybe even the political capitulation of ukraine immediately in a snowball effect.

It has the added benefit of seriously stretching the ukrainian defenses across the country, but it certainly looks like they were hoping that things would all fall into line and it would be a swift march to kiev with manageable resistance, followed presumably by some sort of televised public spectacle in independence square (god knows what). They'd presumably enforce their demands for Ukraine to 'grant independence' to the donbas/south.

It also makes sense if you interpret that there was no plan B when this strategy failed.... because this WAS the plan B. The 'invasion' was a last resort, and when the 'calculated plan' failed miserably everything went to shit because there wasn't a backup strategy in place.

&gt; * What the Ukrainians did have was a large body of older troops who had experienced fighting in 2014/2015 - and in some cases going back to Afghanistan - who were serving across all ranks. If you went to UAF units you would find 20 year olds and 40 years at the same rank. 6/13

&gt; * In addition, because of the retention problem, and therefore training more specialists than normal, there was a large body of experienced military personnel in civilian roles who could be mobilised. 7/13

&gt; * Another aspect to this was that commanders kept rollerdexes of old comrades with specialist skills in areas like signals and logs and when their unit was rotated into the JFO - for example - would call them up and issue short term contracts.

So the question stands: What accounts for the failure of this Russian initiative? You are wholly attributing it to Russian incompetence.

Indeed, I suggest that the US is probably instrumental in stiffening Ukranian resolve to resist the Russians. (3) It's easy to look at overt actions in the battlespace where reportage is undermined by the intense information warfare and research conclusions. Your assertion presumes that the Russian strategic objectives was to comprehensively defeat the Ukrainians by taking control of the country. There is no evidence that this was so. Indeed, it just does not make any military-operational sense from the Russian point of view.

[],False,,robothistorian,,,[],,,,text,t2_2inubrvw,False,False,"&gt;I concur with your analysis on most everything, well put.

And I concur with yours. And very well put too!

&gt;Due to the quasi-insurgent nature of the Ukrainian defence, the Russian army has lacked a coherent counter-force to push against. Their conventional doctrine revolves around generating mass against more-or-less solid front lines, creating breakthroughs and then exploiting those against opponents that can no longer bring sufficient firepower around to stop their spearheads.

&gt;Now the Russian battering ram faces not a wall but a porous swamp, where there's generally nothing to pit massed fires against, and armored spearheads are completely unable to generate shock to disrupt the defenders, instead getting bogged down and attrited. 

This is, in my opinion, accurate. The Russian (formerly Soviet) theory of ""deep battle"" did consider putting massed fire against strong defensive lines, which were expected to shatter under the weight of fire thus allowing their ""operational manoeuvre groups""  (OMG) to execute maneuver operations deep within any territory.

Your description of how this force employment model of the Russians has been effectively countered is, in my opinion, very accurate.

&gt;Comparisons to the Winter War seem more apt by the day, except of course for the fact that the Ukrainian military is backstopped by the whole of NATO.

Indeed! Moreover the Russians are being hampered by the fact that the Ukrainians are not standing and offering a fight. They are being elusive and chipping away at the Russian battering ram. And, they know *where* to chip away given the likely excellent Intel support they must be receiving from the US/NATO.

&gt;I now see no other possible outcome but an utterly humiliating defeat for the Russians

This is the only point where I may not agree with you. I have a few reasons for this. (1) This idea of Russia trying to take over *all* of Ukraine is a conjecture. We have assumed that this is Russia's strategic intent and the Russian operations around Kyiv seems to have reinforced our idea about this. But I am still not convinced that this was the Russian objective. If it was, then I have to accept the fact that the Russian General Staff and their political strategists (including President Putin) are dolts because they would have known that the US/NATO/the EU would not standby and let that happen. As it is, they have already succeeded in rallying the most powerful forces against themselves and they are nowhere close to capturing all of Ukraine. (2) President Putin and his strategists would have known that even if they had captured all of Ukraine, they would be faced with an expensive insurgency, which would only be a losing proposition for them (the Russians). They have not only the US experience in Iraq to look at, but also their own experience in Afghanistan. So, I tend to think their strategic objectives were more limited to begin with. (3) If this reasoning hold, then what would those limited objectives be? If you look at the map of Ukraine and focus on the East and South East parts, you will notice that the major waterways provide a natural defensive line. It also gives the Russians, if they consolidate along that line (which is why I also think Kherson is an important objective for the Russians) then they would have control over some of the richest parts of Ukraine. They could not only extract whatever that is to extract from that region, but they can also use it as a bargaining chip in any postwar negotiations. 

The only fly in the ointment is that I strongly suspect that Ukraine is not going to stop for an unconditional Russian withdrawal. I don't think so because I think this is more of a US demand and not a Ukranian one. The US stands to gain much by inflicting an unmitigated strategic defeat on Russia. It could mean the fall of President Putin (unlikely but can't be ruled out) and it would be a serious weakening of the Sino-Russian axis (though in the short term Russia would lean heavily on the PRC, but equally it would mean that the PRC would have to expend energy and resources to prop up Russia).",3aa259c8764c1f64d510ee1afa0ce0013ab1a4dd,True,False,,,,,0,1651753392,,0,{},i7f0z8h,True,t3_uik9pj,False,True,t1_i7evhhw,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uik9pj/assault_breaker_2_and_the_unfolding_events_in/i7f0z8h/,1651753404,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651724592.0,,

On the lack of artillery employment, I think the Russians have simply been unable to bring their guns to bear on meaningful targets. Due to the quasi-insurgent nature of the Ukrainian defence,  the Russian army has lacked a coherent counter-force to push against. Their conventional doctrine revolves around generating mass against more-or-less solid front lines, creating breakthroughs and then exploiting those against opponents that can no longer bring sufficient firepower around to stop their spearheads.

Now the Russian battering ram faces not a wall but a porous swamp, where there's generally nothing to pit massed fires against, and armored spearheads are completely unable to generate shock to disrupt the defenders, instead getting bogged down and attrited. 

All of this is endemic of the information gap between the two sides. Whereas the Russian guns can't effectively engage targets more mobile than *cities,* the defenders can pinpoint and engage enemy advances, and recently even staging areas, with ease.

Comparisons to the Winter War seem more apt by the day, except of course for the fact that the Ukrainian military is backstopped by the whole of NATO.

I now see no other possible outcome but an utterly humiliating defeat for the Russians.

1. Does Ukraine have the combat power to push the Russians back.
Versus.
2. Does Russia still have enough mass to hold their positions.

So, for this there is a lot of fog of war around this as though Russians are around 25% percent atrophied for their current force according to British MoD, we don’t know how damaged the Ukrainians are and that determines a lot about their offensive capabilities. From how the fighting is brutal but the Ukrainians are still counter attacking, I would wager that JOF and professional troops are functional, but the territorial defense force has suffered pretty horrific casualties (I could be entirely wrong here though).

On one hand, I don’t think the Ukrainians are just dominating at casually smacking the Russians around with minimal losses. The Russians, thought tactically, strategically, and operationally lacking, still pack a tremendous amount of firepower, though that gulf is shrinking more from their losses, new weapons for Ukraine, and ingenuity and tactical inferiority.

From this, I’d say that the Russians are probably stumbling forward into a mistake still, though my assumption has a margin of error in that they could still totally achieve some operational successes if they manage a breakthrough (not impossible; but they need to do it soon). 

The big problems that Russia are facing now multi-fold. 1. Their best soldiers have been beyond decimated. The causalities they are reportedly taking are gut churning for any force to say the least. The VDV, 4th Tanks, and other units of note have all suffered terrible losses. And those would be the ones I want to establish a defense as soon as possible rather than less experienced, less motivated conscripts. 2. Shifting to defense needs to be done quickly or will necessitate a bit of retreat in places. They need to hold ground they are certain they can defend. This means fighting close to the pocket for them, shortening supply lines (if they decide to make a last stand at Izyum, I suspect the JOF will just massacre the logistics troops and wait for the BTGs to starve before offering terms of surrender. This means moving back to a held city or other secured areas. Reasonably, but politically and morale-wise would be massively unpopular due to it being an outright admission of strategic defeat. I could be wrong about Izyum’s long term defensibility and other matters but the commanders in the field are basically at the point where they might considering death in combat or disgrace at home if they pull back. 3. They’re still fighting in enemy territory. If they try to hold Kherson for a long time, they will need to establish 2 fronts. One to keep civilians and partisans from killing or blowing up defenses at night. One to fight the army proper. There is no hearts and minds here. The people are part of the enemy and have good odds of going berserk if they push too hard or prove to be too soft. So, they’re in a hard place here too as they get to possibly fight both a conventional war and an insurgency at the same time.

What I’m interested in is what happens should they retreat to the Separatist regions. Those are their areas and should be much more defensible, but previously the Ukrainians were reluctant to go as hard due to the threat of Russian invasion. Well, now that the blades are drawn and Russia has be found wanting, I suspect we’re going to see mass devastation tear through the area even if the Russians hunker down. Additionally, I don’t know the exact separatist casualties, but from what I’ve heard they’re past several thresholds of brutalized. What happens if that force shatters entirely in the region? Can the Russians hold that area alone? This remains to be seen of their remaining forces against Ukraine’s. By the point that they are retreating to those regions though, I would be surprised if desertions and refusals to fight spike. That territory is prolonged defeat and death rather than any kind of win. 

Politically, I can can see a “we lost 20-30 thousand men to change nothing” as politically viable for anyone back home.

Another thing I’m morbidly interested in is how the Ukrainians might treat the separatists and the region. Russians, though the enemy, are worth political capital alive as currency and bargaining chips.

No one needs the Separatists if Russia loses entirely. So, I’m curious to what discipline and control the Ukrainians hold themselves if they get there. If they obliterate the entire territory, I doubt anyone would make too much noise, but I’m curious how they’ll sort the people there. Might trade the native Russians for Ukrainians. What happens to Separatists caught is likely imprisonment at best.",b4f5f79412581393e909349fd2d2fe541a227b23,True,False,,,,,0,1651749433,,0,{},i7eueez,False,t3_ui4xlp,False,True,t1_i7eqex3,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ui4xlp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_04_2022/i7eueez/,1651749445,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651720633.0,,

Russia's current aim it to control the Donbas and southern Ukrainian coast, whilst it may never actually achieve these goals totally it controls much of that area now. The general belief is that Russia cannot hold this ground in the long term using conventional means, Ukraine's mobilisation and arming by the west will inevitably lead to them overwhelming the Russian forces and liberating their territory. Russia's only way of maintaining its territorial gains is if it convinces Ukraine to stop fighting, something that will be very difficult to do. This is where nukes may become a factor.

What if Putin announces a general ceasefire stating that the special operation is over, that the territory they control is now part of Russia and that any attack on Russian territory will be met by a nuclear response.

1. Russians out of their territory. All of it. (Their rhetoric on Crimea leans more towards diplomacy than outright assault though. But expect them to fight for every inch of the Donbas.)
2. Their filtrated citizens back. (Unlikely to get all of them. But trading POWs will come in handy here.)
3. Reassurances that Russia won’t invade again (Either by castrating Russia militarily or through western assurances. The way seems to be proceeding, both things are happening.

Ukraine doesn’t want to fight and butcher every last Russian to a total annihilation victory because a. It’s going to drag out the war for years and years if they go that farm b) it comes at the cost of more civilians getting bombed every day. If all the Russians just surrendered or went home back beyond the 2014 borders, Ukraine probably wouldn’t keep fighting them.


As for whether Ukraine would stop fighting if Russia were to propose peace, then it really depends on what the Russians are offering and the situation at the time. If Ukraine continues to win or savage the Russians militarily and Russia offers terms in which they keep the current territory they’ve gained, then no. If it is a full retreat along with return of all territory, then maybe (but Russia has blundered badly in terms of trustworthiness and therefore will probably have to make additional assurances before any kind of trust is established.)

How? The Ukrainians have an intel advantage against Russia because 1. the Russians are using shitty unsecured radios, walkie talkies, and even cellphones, easily intercepted by US/Ukrainian intel. Even a Russian general was killed because he was using a cellphone. And 2. the US provides intel to Ukraine by flying aircraft/drones in NATO countries along the border with Ukraine. Ukraine knew every move the Russians were making in the north.

So how can we assume that the PLA will also have such poor equipment, and that the US will be able to fly recon near Taiwan?",c4a7e37fb84e42344e3a97317d7df80345d9fc24,True,False,,,,,0,1651744594,,0,{},i7enylx,False,t3_uigw3g,False,True,t1_i7dyeen,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uigw3g/deterring_china_a_victory_denial_strategy_the/i7enylx/,1651744607,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651715794.0,,

On my part, thank you. 

&gt;I believe that the Russian leadership truly envisioned that this would be a ""special military operation,"" a fait accompli in the style of Crimea at a vast scale. For a minute there it looked like it could indeed be successful, but then to the shock of many, the Ukrainians fought back instead of submitting

Yes, I think so too. But it was also a bit OTT for being what in the West is referred to as MOOTW (military operations other than war). That said, in my opinion, I don't think the Ukranians would have managed to hold off the Russians if they were left to their devices. The success that they have achieved - without diminishing their spirit of combat - is completely and totally dependent on the US and NATO.

&gt;I believe that the Ukrainian military is effectively subordinate to NATO/US command, in the sense that they are acting primarily based on intelligence and recommendations generated by the non-combatant allies, down to the company level in some cases. Ad-hoc lines of communication, first established between intelligence and ground units to enable kill-chains, have likely coalesced into a battlespace where units operating relatively independently in their respective AOs are directed very dynamically to counter threats and exploit vulnerabilities as they present themselves

I agree with this and I think it feeds into the pony I was making above. In fact, in many instances, I think the Ukrainian forces adopted a quasi-insurgency posture, which just made (and makes life) exceedingly difficult for the Russians.

This leads me to a third point, namely, why did the Russians not employ the full force of their artillery? While it is true that they may have taken some losses, but the havoc they would have reigned on the Ukranians would have probably been many magnitudes greater than the already considerable damage they have already done. I can think of two reasons: (1) Like you mentioned, they began the operation as a ""special operation"" and did not factor in the use of their heaviest guns. Moreover, they likely assumed that since the operation would have been relatively easy, they would avoid the large-scale destruction (and attendant casualties) and thereby they would have fought a considerably less brutal campaign than what they are usually known for. And (2) I don't think they can use their heavy guns any more because now they recognise that the scope of the operation has widened and has, effectively, slipped out of their control. Whereas when they began they assumed they would maintain control over the op, but, like Moltke said, (paraphrasing very generously here) once operations start, they usually take a life of their own and all one can do is to follow it to its logical conclusion.",9bf1a080f945be09f3be2cc825062f9b867ed4b9,True,False,,,,,0,1651734760,,0,{},i7ectss,True,t3_uik9pj,False,True,t1_i7eaa9z,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uik9pj/assault_breaker_2_and_the_unfolding_events_in/i7ectss/,1651734776,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651705960.0,,

Because they can't. They have no avenues to respond that aren't an escalation to direct warfare. 

They've previously put bounties on US soldier's heads in Afghanistan - but something similar to that is about the only response they can muster. There is no conflict the West is involved with where they can share intel with the opposing side, they can't meddle in elections/politics as much as they used to because Western countries have already started clamping down, and they have no economic tools with which to harm Europe or the US. 

The only thing would be to shut off the gas, but that would a) be quite the escalation, and b) cut off Russia from basically their only source of government revenue with no way to replace it.

They don't have to, they need to overmatch whatever the US can deploy to the region.

Let's keep in mind that China is expected to have a $40 Trillion economy by 2030, China spends 1.7% of gdp vs USA 3.5%, that Taiwan is within range of missiles, airbases and ports from the mainland, whereas the US has a few bases in Japan and SK and those have to be supplied from across the Pacific Ocean, 

Let's do some simple math: China in 2030, $40 T economy x 3% = $1.2 Trillion military budget, most of which is focused eastward, from their coastline, compared to the US which is engaged all over the world.  US estimated will be $24T economy x 4% = $0.96 T and far more of this money will be spend on Europe, and veteran healthcare, burdens China doesn't have to deal with. Let's also dismiss the real possibility that China will continue to steal anything of military value soon after the US develops it, like they have with so many other programs.

Are you so sure that a military that enjoys such a budget couldn't destroy US bases and deter US assets from intervening??

&gt;The strait is massive and they'd have to somehow get troops over it while we sink their entire navy from the air

Why would China send over their navy before they blow up anything that looks like an airbase first?

I believe the placement of the semi conductor factories were planned with larger strategic goals. Taiwans control of the worlds chip manufacturing acts as a deterrent  from a direct attack. Previously the was also filling cheaper labor production and ease of access to eastern markets. However now it acts as a geopolitical asset for taiwans sovereignty.Damage the foundry’s and the world is thrown into disarray including China. Therefore the world has a stake in avoiding a physical war on Taiwans soil. While also adding a cause that would be supported by the west for direct US intervention if an attack were to occur.

Why would this be changing? Geopolitical Negotiations is my belief. The world is attempting to rebalance its power structure in the face of peak oil and global warming. Concessions are being made by the west to avoid nuclear war and maintain the status quo with not only China but Russia. Each of which are looking for claiming their “historical lands” but doing so as not to incite a direct confrontation with the west. 

We also must ask the question, what is the future of Taiwans geographical and economic  significance. companies are automating, and bringing back manufacturing to something inhouse has become more appealing. Is Taiwans geographical location worth fighting for when cyber warfare and space command becomes more prevalent. I believe China and US policy both have this in mind.

The only reason the Qing attempted an invasion was because Zheng Jing died of an illness. When Qing inhabited Taiwan, they only controlled the western plains and used it as a base for fishing, not allowing any of its citizens to actual settle there with their families.

When Japanese invaded, they knew the Qing had no interest in defending Taiwan and they didn't.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Medvedchuk


""On 11 May 2021, Medvedchuk and fellow Opposition Platform — For Life lawmaker Taras Kozak were named as suspects for alleged high treason and the illegal exploitation of natural resources in Ukraine's Russian-annexed Crimea.[77][78] Three days later Medvedchuk was put under house arrest and fitted with an electronic tracking device.[79] On 14 May 2021 Russian authorities began the process of liquidating the Russian company Novye Proekty which was allegedly used by Medvedchuk for his alleged illegal exploitations in Crimea.[80]""


""During a massive build-up of Russian troops around Ukraine's borders in the first weeks of 2022, Medvedchuk was one of two people (the other one being Oleg Tsaryov) identified by the United States intelligence community as a possible Kremlin-supported choice to lead a pro-Russia puppet Ukrainian government.[85][a] In January 2022 Medvedchuk was placed under sanctions by the US, accusing him of involvement in a plot to set up a collaborator government in the wake of a Russian invasion.[87]

On the opening day of the invasion, 24 February 2022, some analysts expected that Putin may have wanted to install Medvedchuk as president of Ukraine if Russian forces captured Kyiv.[88][b]

Medvedchuk escaped house arrest on 27 February 2022.[11][91] The Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs claimed that Medvedchuk had fled house arrest, while his lawyer claimed that he had been ""evacuated to a safe place in Kyiv"", after alleged threats had been made to his personal safety.[91]

On 8 March 2022, Medvedchuk was deprived of the post of co-chairman of the political party Opposition Platform — For Life.[13]

Although Medvedchuk's whereabouts were still unknown on 18 March 2022, on that date an investigating judge granted the prosecutor's request to impose a in absentia precautionary measure.[92][93][c]

On 12 April 2022, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) arrested Medvedchuk in ""a lightning-fast and dangerous multi-level special operation.""[14] Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy released a photo of Medvedchuk in handcuffs wearing a Ukrainian military uniform.[14]

The SBU claimed on 12 April 2022 that they had foiled an attempt by Russia to get him out of the country.[94]""",334f5c9163da4fea5757deb1e28c3cff55e80980,True,False,,,,,0,1651726408,,0,{},i7e1fay,False,t3_ui4xlp,False,True,t1_i7dzwr7,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ui4xlp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_04_2022/i7e1fay/,1651726421,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651697608.0,,

&gt;Those searching for detailed policy positions searched in vain. While he solicited advice from voters on a campaign website, his platform published online contains only a few anodyne sentences each on key issues of security, the economy, health care, education and the fight against corruption. Throughout the campaign, short video blogs showed Zelenskiy interacting with a range of informal advisers, usually well-regarded reformers or NGO leaders who over the course of three months explained to the public what they think the candidate might believe.

[],False,,robothistorian,,,[],,,,text,t2_2inubrvw,False,False,"Thanks for your post. It was very interesting and informative. I will try to address your queries below.

&gt;Can you expand upon that thought a little more? I don't know what you are referring to. 

&gt;You could be referring to drone and javelin attacks that harassed and halted Russian advances into Ukraine. Which bought the Ukrainians time to bring their artillery to bear on the Russian formations. 

In part, yes I am. But first I would like to draw attention to the fact that the Assault Breaker program was both a strategic and a op-tactical model. It was op-tactical in the way you described it. It was strategic in the sense that the op-tactical measures would have bought NATO/the US time to bring up and deploy the necessary combat capabilities to stem the Soviet tide.

In the context of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, I see a similar dynamic at play. To begin with, my premise is that while the Ukrainians would have no doubt fought bravely, but with lout US/NATO assistance to the level they are receiving, they would likely have been decimated by the Russians. In that sense, the initial days and couple of weeks of the conflict was the time during which Ukraine (backed by the US initially) was able to fight (in the manner in which you described), which stalled the Russians and gave NATO to rally around the Ukrainians. Significantly, it also allowed the US and, to some extent, the EU O sanction Russia (though I still maintain that the sanctions remain half-hearted for a variety of reasons). 

&gt;But I also think that much of the Ukrainian success over the Russians so far has been due to rot in the Russian military, exemplified by poor training and discipline problems, and not fighting with a military strategy at all, as shown by the disasterous race to Kyiv in the crucial early part of the war. 

I agree, for the most part with you here. I do think our estimation of the Russian combat capability was erroneous to a large extent, but more importantly, I think the Russian self-assessment of their own capabilities - both in terms of training and equipment - was seriously flawed. Brutality towards one's own personnel and towards the adversary gets one only thus far in the battlespace as the Russians and the Germans found out in the 2nd World War. Operational and tactical skill counts for a lot more. And, in this conflict the Russian op-tactical skill appears to be very poor.

That said, I recall being in a conversation with someone in one of these subs and he (or she) did bring something interesting to my attention. Building off the initial Russian declaration as the Ukraine conflict being a ""military operation"" and not a war, it could have been possible that the Russians had originally planned for this to be an ""intensive policing operation"", which may have been nothing more than a fig leaf. That leaves the Russian move towards Kyiv unexplained. Unless the

&gt;I honestly am not sure that the US surveillance being provided to Ukraine has seen any benefit of a very recent program like Assault Breaker II, if anything it has more pieces of the original flavor. With the JSTARS flying around the borders of Ukraine

 Russians were looking to take over the entire of Ukraine, that move made no sense unless it was a feint. Now, I have recently read elsewhere that this ""feint"" concept is wrong because (1) it was too heavy to be a feint, (2) because the Russians lost a lot of personnel and equipment in the process. But I am not convinced. This is because of two reasons: (1) It is difficult to understand how and under what circumstances Russia could have convinced itself that it could take over *all* of Ukraine. It makes more sense for them to concentrate on the eastern and south eastern part of Ukraine because not only are the inhabitants relatively well-disposed towards them but also because those are some of the richest areas in the Ukraine. (2) More importantly, Russian strategists would have had to know that a grab attempt of the whole of Ukraine would necessarily provoke NATO and the US and that would be counterproductive to their strategic aims. It could have been possible that they assumed that the capture of Ukraine would have been an easy job, but they could not have failed to learn from the problems that the US faced in Iraq and Afghanistan when it's pacification programs failed and they had to withdraw. So a sharp limited war with limited objectives would make more sense. Put differently, the operation against Kyiv does not make sense unless it is seen either as an expression of an insane and misguided plan OR as a feint with the specific objective to tie down Ukrainian forces in that area while initiating operations in the East and South East to achieve the real objectives.

&gt;I honestly am not sure that the US surveillance being provided to Ukraine has seen any benefit of a very recent program like Assault Breaker II, if anything it has more pieces of the original flavor

This is difficult to say - at least for me. What seems obvious to me is that Ukraine is the beneficiary of not simply weaponry but also of quite rich intelligence across the strategic and op-tactical levels. It is also clear to me that the Ukrainians - brave fighters though they may be - do not have the technical means or even the skill to cull the kind of intelligence that is required to stall an adversary like Russia (despite the already discussed shortcomings of the Russians). This intel, I'd argue, is even more valuable than the weapons that Ukraine is getting. The question is what are the assets that the US are employing to support this extraordinary intelligence collection and analysis effort. I would guess that while they are using some of their legacy systems from the original Assault Breaker programs, they must also be leveraging some of their newer platforms and capabilities.

I say this because if we take a step back and look at how this conflict in Ukraine manifested itself, we (or at least I) cannot help but take note of the deep complicit of the US in contributing to the shaping of the ""strategic battlespace"". In that sense, Russia's primary adversary is no longer Ukraine but is the US (and NATO). And, in this sense, Russia has already suffered a strategic defeat since this was precisely the situation that it would have wanted to avoid. Conversely, from the point of view of the US and NATO, the way things are progressing in Ukraine is exactly what the Assault Breaker program was designed to bring about.

Lastly, about Multi-domain Battle/warfare. I have two points to make about this:

(1) I think the Multi-domain Battle Concept was designed to explore the ways and means by which to move beyond the purely op-tactical concepts/models of the Air-Land (and Sea-Land) Battle to provide a macro theory of war for the 21st Century (by the Americans). I say this because it stands as a replacement of the  theory of Network-centric Warfare, which 99% of the people misunderstood as being an extension of [Admiral Owens' ""system of systems"" concept](https://web.archive.org/web/20100105160638/http://www.ndu.edu/inss/strforum/SF_63/forum63.html) but whose original designers were clear that it was nothing less than [""a theory of war for the Information Age"".](http://dodccrp.org/files/Alberts_NCW.pdf). Now, having being stung by the adverse reaction that the Force Transformation project had faced, US theorists were more careful this time around and spoke in terms of a ""concept of a battle"" than as a ""concept of war"". I came across a very interesting [document](https://cenjows.in/pdf-view/?url=2022/02/The-Multi-Domain-Battle_03-11-18.pdf&amp;pID=5832) produced by, of all the places, an in-house think-tank of the Indian Integrated Defence Staff HQ , which dealt with this topic in some detail.

(2) It is a common misnomer that the Multi-domain concept implirs and/or involves dominance in and of every domain. The idea of dominance in any domain was a fantasy perpetuated by the Full Spectrum Dominance model, which met a fast death in the Battlefields of Iraq in latter stages of the 2nd Iraq War. The Multi-domain Battle (or warfare) concept is quite innovative (again the document from the Indian Integrated Defence Staff goes into this in some detail). It includes but is in excess of what we traditionally consider as domains (land, air, space, hydrosphere, electromagnetic spectrum etc). It includes or can include other ""domains"" such as culture, society, finance, economics etc etc. These are domains where contestation is to be expected as the more kinetic operations are underway. In other words, war is not so much a question of ""forever war"" but a question of ""everywhere war"". Some have argued that this is a dilution of the concept of war, but I am not sure I would agree especially if we look at the etymological.roota of the word war. Interestingly, the Chinese with their concept of ""unrestricted warfare"" seem to share this perspective.

Again, this has ended up being a lengthy response to your most excellent post. I will draw this to a close here and hope that I have addressed at least some of your queries/points.",68a89a8bccd442da23b98cca0a325a5deae65e54,True,False,,,,,0,1651722410,,0,{},i7dufka,True,t3_uik9pj,False,True,t1_i7ddna6,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uik9pj/assault_breaker_2_and_the_unfolding_events_in/i7dufka/,1651722425,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651693610.0,,

&gt;* there will be no significant ""cyber warfare"" - the whole idea is pretty much a scam by contractors to steal taxpayer money - totally validated

I don't know that we really have enough information to conclude this yet. I've read that as a general rule it's hard to spot cyber warfare, both successes and failures, and that makes sense to me since it's not kinetic. But we have things that could be cyber warfare, like all those fires you mentioned. And the Ukrainian internet keeps crashing periodically. So we might be seeing the effects of cyber warfare without it being announced.

Also, this may not be a great conflict for assessing the utility of cyber warfare. Both Ukraine and Russia have modern technology, but they are economically depressed so they may not have as much connectivity in infrastructure as richer nations. It's plausible that Taiwan and China would offer more targets for cyber warfare, for example.

Lastly, it seemed to me that the fields of cyber warfare and electronic spying are more of a continuum than separate things. You try to hack anything you can get your hands on in the opposing nation, and sometimes you get information, sometimes you get access to something you can break or hijack, and sometimes you get both. If it's just information 90 or even 95% of the time, that doesn't mean you shouldn't break things when you get the chance, or harden your systems against it.

&gt;* there will be no significant Ukrainian guerilla in occupied territory, war will be decided conventionally - as no low birthrate society ever had major resistance movement - totally validated

I think this is right in the narrow sense that wars, especially modern conventional wars, tend to rarely if ever be decided by resistance movements. I can't recall an example of that happening off the top of my head, where a resistance movement sprung up and found its feet before the conventional fighting stopped.

But I think there are a couple reasons for that. One is that most wars end in months, and resistance movements develop over years. We haven't had the time to grow a resistance movement in Ukraine.

We also haven't had the circumstances, because there is still some freedom of movement even in occupied Ukraine, as the refugees movement demonstrates. So people who want to fight Russia can just join the military and do it more effectively then they could in a resistance movement. The collapse of organized resistance would naturally divert people into disorganized resistance. Given the popularity of organized resistance, it doesn't seem intuitive to me that there wouldn't be disorganized resistance down the road if Ukraine somehow was conquered.

It's also interesting in this case because the occupier, Russia, has the same demographic problems as the occupied, which likely plays a role in why they are invading with such a small army. Presumably they would also occupy with a small army, and that might make the birthrate issue less significant than it would otherwise be.

&gt;* current sanctions are total bs, and Russian economy will do totally fine unless Russian energy exports are massively restricted - pretty well validated, looks like Russians have more problems with fire safety than sanctions

I don't think Russia is running out of money, but it seems to be running out of supplies, especially things like electronic components. The picture of that fighter jet cockpit with the commercial GPS clamped to the dashboard and the rumor the only tank factory in the country shut down for lack of parts seem to point towards success in sanctions to me - but that the critical dimension is refusing to sell Russians things, not refusing to buy Russian things.

&gt;* Western fear of escalation over heavy weapon delivery is idiotic, if Russia wanted Lake Moscow, it would have escalated itself to get Lake Moscow - totally validated, NATO keeps escalating in baby steps, with zero reaction from Russia except coping and seething; we should have sent those damn MiGs

We don't have a counterfactual to test here. The baby steps may have altered Russia's reaction, like the difference between cooking a lobster and tossing it into boiling water. We know the path we took worked, it isn't clear it jumping straight to heavy armor and jets would have avoided conflict too.


FWIW my personal opinion is that the way the escalation has played out has demonstrated that Russia is bluffing, and unwilling to do anything that would risk conflict with NATO. I think the most likely result of NATO going into Ukraine to fight Russia would be Russia retreating to their borders. But I don't have enough confidence in this to conclude that I've been proven right, and it seems to me NATO has taken the safe path.

&gt;* Russian will likely abandon Kherson and blow up the bridges behind them so they can focus all troops on Donbas offensive - failed here

I don't think it's right to call this a failure. Again we don't have the counterfactual, and we don't have the outcome of the war yet, but Russia's current offensive isn't looking good, and most of the assessments I see attribute that to their inability to concentrate sufficient forces. Reducing the front by sealing of the river would have helped there.

Then, Korea was absolutely a victory in a sense. Why? Because China was basically an agarian state going up against industrialized state with air support and combine arms. Chinese soldiers would be happy with just the idea that Soviet air craft is backing them hundreds of milea behind them. China perserved an ally in NK, expelled the UN forces approaching Yalu, and cemented the alliance with USSR, although in the long run whether that was good or not may be debated but Soviet advisors help China industrialized, until Mao decided to go with the GLF.

Then, the idea that China is a revisionist power has been said as if it's 100% truth. So then we must ask why is Chinese institutions like the AIIB just like any other western institutions? Why does China demand more power in existing institutions?

Or do you think China wanting larger roles is an act of revisionism? That there is somehow a place a state is in, and that is it. They should know their place?

I don't know what Taiwan would choose. I only know that, absent U.S. support, continued autonomy would become impossible.

&gt;Keep amphibs from crossing the strait. A few hundred CAPTOR mines could make a landing (or any naval action, for that matter) nearly impossible. Without amphibs, China can't land heavy vehicles or large quantities of troops and certainly can't sustainably resupply any large invasion force that it might airdrop.

CAPTOR mines are anti-submarine weapons.

&gt;Deny air superiority. **If** Taiwan can defend its airfields against missile strikes with C-RAM or similar close-in defense systems, and can sustain air defense with PATRIOT missiles or other medium-to-long range SAM systems in combination with fighter aircraft, it can use its own air power to destroy approaching Chinese ships, again denying amphibious landing.

To quote the Lacedaemonians, ""if"". Otherwise, China could conduct a SEAD / DEAD campaign and establish air superiority and, eventually, air dominance over the island and its surrounding waters.

&gt;Cripple attempted landings: If Taiwan can quickly disperse minefields along any beaches China might try to use, and if they can defend those beachheads with mobile anti-ship missiles, shoulder-fired missiles, or shore-launched torpedoes, they can again shut down any attempted landing.

Or China can suppress the defenders with a large-scale CAS and air interdiction campaign.

&gt;Win the war of attrition: If all else fails, having tens of thousands of people trained and equipped to serve as snipers and saboteurs, and having extra weapons/ammo at hundreds of distributed caches would allow them to quickly recruit and train hundreds of thousands of volunteers who could engage in guerrilla warfare against an occupying Chinese force. Over many years, this could cause unacceptably high casualties and costs, eventually leading China to withdraw.

Or China can crush the insurgency with a brutal repression campaign, including deportations to the mainland if necessary.

&gt;If Taiwan can succeed at any one of these, it wins.

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/04/us/politics/russia-generals-killed-ukraine.html?referringSource=articleShare

WASHINGTON — The United States has provided intelligence about Russian units that has allowed Ukrainians to target and kill many of the Russian generals who have died in action in the Ukraine war, according to senior American officials.

Ukrainian officials said they have killed approximately 12 generals on the front lines, a number that has astonished military analysts.

The targeting help is part of a classified effort by the Biden administration to provide real-time battlefield intelligence to Ukraine. That intelligence also includes anticipated Russian troop movements gleaned from recent American assessments of Moscow’s secret battle plan for the fighting in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, the officials said. Officials declined to specify how many generals had been killed as a result of U.S. assistance.

The United States has focused on providing the location and other details about the Russian military’s mobile headquarters, which relocate frequently. Ukrainian officials have combined that geographic information with their own intelligence — including intercepted communications that alert the Ukrainian military to the presence of senior Russian officers — to conduct artillery strikes and other attacks that have killed Russian officers.

The intelligence sharing is part of a stepped-up flow in U.S. assistance that includes heavier weapons and tens of billions in aid, demonstrating how quickly the early American restraints on support for Ukraine have shifted as the war enters a new stage that could play out over months.

U.S. intelligence support to the Ukrainians has had a decisive effect on the battlefield, confirming targets identified by the Ukrainian military and pointing it to new targets. The flow of actionable intelligence on the movement of Russian troops that America has given Ukraine has few precedents.

Since failing to advance on Kyiv, the capital, in the early part of the war, Russia has tried to regroup, with a more concentrated push in eastern Ukraine that so far has moved slowly and unevenly.

Officials interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the classified intelligence being shared with Ukraine.

The administration has sought to keep much of the battlefield intelligence secret, out of fear it will be seen as an escalation and provoke President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia into a wider war. American officials would not describe how they have acquired information on Russian troop headquarters, for fear of endangering their methods of collection. But throughout the war, the U.S. intelligence agencies have used a variety of sources, including classified and commercial satellites, to trace Russian troop movements.

Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III went so far as to say last month that “we want to see Russia weakened to the degree it cannot do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine.”

Asked about the intelligence being provided to the Ukrainians, John F. Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said that “we will not speak to the details of that information.” But he acknowledged that the United States provides “Ukraine with information and intelligence that they can use to defend themselves.”

Not all the strikes have been carried out with American intelligence. A strike over the weekend at a location in eastern Ukraine where Gen. Valery Gerasimov, Russia’s highest-ranking uniformed officer, had visited was not aided by American intelligence, according to multiple U.S. officials. The United States prohibits itself from providing intelligence about the most senior Russian leaders, officials said.

But American intelligence was critical in the deaths of other generals, officials acknowledged.

The United States routinely provides information about the movement of Russian troops and equipment, and helps Ukraine confirm the location of critical targets. Other NATO allies also give real-time intelligence to the Ukrainian military.

The Biden administration is also supplying new weaponry that should improve Ukraine’s ability to target senior Russian officers. The smaller version of the Switchblade drone, which is now arriving on the battlefield, can be used to identify and kill individual soldiers, and could take out a general sitting in a vehicle or giving orders on a front line.

American officials have acknowledged publicly that the United States began giving Ukraine actionable intelligence in the run-up to Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24. Ahead of the invasion, for example, U.S. intelligence agencies warned of an impending attack on the Hostomel airport north of Kyiv. That allowed Ukraine to strengthen its defenses. Russian airborne forces were ultimately unable to hold the airfield.

While the information the United States has provided Ukraine has proved valuable, Russian generals have often left themselves exposed to electronic eavesdropping by speaking over unsecure phones and radios, current and former American military officials said.

“It shows poor discipline, lack of experience, arrogance and failure to appreciate Ukrainian capabilities,” said Frederick B. Hodges, the former top U.S. Army commander in Europe who is now with the Center for European Policy Analysis. “It is not hard to geo-locate someone on a phone talking in the clear.”

Fears of an expanded war rise. With the Russian military still struggling, Western officials are looking with increased alarm to Russia’s Victory Day holiday on May 9. Anxiety is growing that President Vladimir V. Putin will exploit the celebration of the Soviet triumph over the Nazis to intensify attacks and formally declare war.

Russian oil embargo. The European Union unveiled a plan to halt imports of Russian crude oil in the next six months and refined oil products by the end of the year. If approved as expected, it would be the bloc’s biggest and costliest step yet toward ending its own dependence on Russian fossil fuels.

Support for Moldova. The E.U. promised to provide additional military support for Moldova, the increasingly pressured neighbor of Ukraine. Security fears have grown there during the invasion, swelling after a series of explosions rocked Transnistria, the country’s own breakaway region, where Russia has maintained soldiers since 1992.

On the ground. Moscow continued to demonstrate its destructive power. In the western city of Lviv, strikes on three power substations knocked out electricity in many areas. In the eastern region of Donetsk, 21 people died on May 3, the highest number of casualties in a day since last month.

Russian military tactics have also left senior generals vulnerable. A centralized, top-down command hierarchy gives decision-making authority only to the highest levels — compared to the more decentralized American structure that pushes many battlefield decisions to senior enlisted personnel and junior officers — forcing Russian generals to make risky trips to the front lines to resolve logistical and operational issues.

“When there are problems, the general officers have to go sort it out,” said General Hodges.

Although the administration remains wary of inflaming Mr. Putin to the point that he further escalates his attacks — President Biden has said he will not send American troops to Ukraine or establish a “no-fly zone” there — current and former officials said the White House finds some value in warning Russia that Ukraine has the weight of the United States and NATO behind it.

Some European officials believe, despite Mr. Putin’s rhetoric that Russia is battling NATO and the West, he has so far been deterred from starting a wider war. American officials are less certain, and have been debating for weeks why Mr. Putin has not done more to escalate the conflict.

Officials said Moscow has its own calculations to weigh, including whether it can handle a bigger war, particularly one that would allow NATO to invoke its mutual defense charter or enter the war more directly.

“Clearly, we want the Russians to know on some level that we are helping the Ukrainians to this extent, and we will continue to do so,” said Evelyn Farkas, the former top Defense Department official for Russia and Ukraine in the Obama administration. “We will give them everything they need to win, and we’re not afraid of Vladimir Putin’s reaction to that. We won’t be self-deterred.”

But intelligence sharing is considered a safe form of help because it is invisible, or, at least, deniable. American intelligence has given secret information to Ukraine in a wide range of areas, from Russian troop movements to targeting data, officials said.

Last month, the United States increased the flow of intelligence to Ukraine about Russian forces in the Donbas and Crimea, as Kyiv’s military forces prepared to defend against a renewed offensive by Moscow in eastern Ukraine, U.S. officials said.

“There’s a significant amount of intelligence flowing to Ukraine from the United States,” Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a Senate panel on Tuesday. “We have opened up the pipes.”",ba18ee5dbe8155f45a219ae6d954046ae5763886,True,False,,,,,0,1651715902,,0,{},i7dh394,False,t3_ui4xlp,False,True,t3_ui4xlp,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ui4xlp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_04_2022/i7dh394/,1651715918,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651687102.0,,

Russia has already lost a significant chunk of it's Black Seas Fleet to a country with very little air force (and almost no- anti-ship strike capability), very few anti-ship weapons (the Neptune was barely off the testing line), and almost no Navy.  That doesn't bode well for any long-term blockade attempt. 

2.  Taiwan, like every other Island nation during wartime, will institute rationing and food self sufficiency programs the minute war is declared  Britain in WW1 suffered heavily and managed to greatly reduce food and fuel imports for WW2 as a result. Taiwan (with a much easier climate) will undoubtedly do even better factoring in more recent technology. 

3. Taiwan will have the greatest military power on earth at it's side in a war. China's Navy and air force will suffer heavily attrition very quickly in combat operations against the USA and (likely) Japan. Taiwan and Japan's Islands are an unsinkable series of aircraft carriers parked off the coast of China.  They will never be able to put it out of commission and the USA will be able to ferry airplanes/critical materiel from a distance using their other islands and carriers. 

4. Taiwan can obtain all three assets needed to render China's Navy inoperable even without the USA.  

5. Once war is declared the only assets China will be able to 100% protect will be their submarines which, while they'll certainly attempt to inflict damage, are unlikely to be a war winner against the entire US Navy.  China's Anti-Ship missiles will be greatly reduced in effectiveness as long as the US Navy operates at a distance. 

6. Operation Vittles. 

7. China's entire economy relies in exports. they attempt a blockade and that ends right quick.  their economy collapses overnight.  They attempt any sort of blockade and their energy imports end overnight too.  Best of luck finding energy for 1.4 Billion people.

And their government is arming up for war.

In short, war is inevitable, and the question is whether the US and its allies and the Chinese and their allies are prepared for it.

Would *you* lie down and roll over for China if they invaded your country? What makes you think Taiwan would do that?

Taiwan has multiple victory conditions, any one of which would block a Chinese invasion: 

* Keep amphibs from crossing the strait. A few hundred CAPTOR mines could make a landing (or any naval action, for that matter) nearly impossible. Without amphibs, China can't land heavy vehicles or large quantities of troops and certainly can't sustainably resupply any large invasion force that it might airdrop.

* Deny air superiority. If Taiwan can defend its airfields against missile strikes with C-RAM or similar close-in defense systems, and  can sustain air defense with PATRIOT missiles or other medium-to-long range SAM systems in combination with fighter aircraft, it can use its own air power to destroy approaching Chinese ships, again denying amphibious landing.

* Cripple attempted landings: If Taiwan can quickly disperse minefields along any beaches China might try to use, and if they can defend those beachheads with mobile anti-ship missiles, shoulder-fired missiles, or shore-launched torpedoes, they can again shut down any attempted landing.

* Win the war of attrition: If all else fails, having tens of thousands of people trained and equipped to serve as snipers and saboteurs, and having extra weapons/ammo at hundreds of distributed caches would allow them to quickly recruit and train hundreds of thousands of volunteers who could engage in guerrilla warfare against an occupying Chinese force. Over many years, this could cause unacceptably high casualties and costs, eventually leading China to withdraw.

If Taiwan can succeed at any one of these, it wins. Unfortunately, virtually all of these would likely need to be kept secret to avoid major diplomatic upsets with China. This makes them ineffective as deterrents, except in the abstract sense that Taiwan may have these sorts of plans and assets in place already, and China wouldn't know which (if any) until they try to invade.

Taiwan has 2.4x the GDP of Ukraine. It has been receiving US military aid for years including aid which is delivered in secret initially and revealed later. I would not be at all surprised if Taiwan has one or more of these victory conditions all but guaranteed already. If they do, they have every reason to fight and expect to win, with or without direct US military intervention.",bc7b7f912d92c39cbd6c50877f1d6f58d94343e9,True,False,,,,,0,1651714580,,0,{},i7de64v,False,t3_uigw3g,False,True,t1_i7cwiqx,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uigw3g/deterring_china_a_victory_denial_strategy_the/i7de64v/,1651714594,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651685780.0,,

This is just predictions, so I'm not including controversial opinions without obvious observable consequences (like who's a Russian asset):

* there will be no significant ""cyber warfare"" - the whole idea is pretty much a scam by contractors to steal taxpayer money - totally validated
* there will be no significant Ukrainian guerilla in occupied territory, war will be decided conventionally - as no low birthrate society ever had major resistance movement - totally validated
* current sanctions are total bs, and Russian economy will do totally fine unless Russian energy exports are massively restricted - pretty well validated, looks like Russians have more problems with fire safety than sanctions
* Russian economy would crash if Europe cut its energy exports, while Europe would do totally fine - never had a chance to test it
* in conventional war between NATO and Russia, Russian army would melt away in days just like Saddam's army did - not directly validated, but given how Russia is doing against a country that didn't even have an army 8 years ago, I still totally stand by this prediction
* Western fear of escalation over heavy weapon delivery is idiotic, if Russia wanted Lake Moscow, it would have escalated itself to get Lake Moscow - totally validated, NATO keeps escalating in baby steps, with zero reaction from Russia except coping and seething; we should have sent those damn MiGs
* Donbas offensive is the last major offensive Russia can do, after that they're spent - not validated yet, but I like my odds
* Russian will likely abandon Kherson and blow up the bridges behind them so they can focus all troops on Donbas offensive - failed here
* Mariupol will fall anyday now (predicted very long time ago) - failed here, but so did everybody else
* Russians won't call mobilization, as by the time these troops would hit the frontlines they'd have nothing to equip them with, and it would be very risky politically - prediction still standing very strong
* nothing significant will happen on May 9 - only a few days to find out
* nothing significant will happen with Transnistria - we'll see in coming months
* if Crimea Bridge gets destroyed, Ukraine will take Crimea without much trouble - we might find that out soon enough

And for a bonus, predictions not related to the current war:

* antiship missiles can easily neutralize much stronger navy by forcing them to keep so much distance it might as well not exist (I said that many times about China vs Taiwan / China vs US; should have said that about Ukraine vs Russia, as same logic applies, oh well)
* China could easily blockade Taiwan into surrender, as Taiwan has 1-3 months worth of food and fuel, &lt;30% food self sufficiency, zero fuel self sufficiency, and just preventing civilian shipment from a distance basically achieves this

&gt; Notice how the Ukrainians (in effect, the US and it's NATO allies) struck ""in the early hours of a major attack"" to degrade their adversary's assets and consequently to retard their arranging ability. More importantly, notice how this initial action ""bought time"" for NATO and the EU to rally behind Ukraine and to ""mobilize"" (i.e., to provide it with weapons etc.).

Can you expand upon that thought a little more? I don't know what you are referring to. 

You could be referring to drone and javelin attacks that harassed and halted Russian advances into Ukraine. Which bought the Ukrainians time to bring their artillery to bear on the Russian formations. 

I do believe that much of this anti-tank technology was developed to solve the 'Soviet armored hordes' problem. So to a degree, yes the Ukrainians have implemented the West's counter to Soviet armor some 30 years after the end of the Cold War.

But I also think that much of the Ukrainian success over the Russians so far has been due to rot in the Russian military, exemplified by poor training and discipline problems, and not fighting with a military strategy at all, as shown by the disasterous race to Kyiv in the crucial early part of the war. 

The early days of the war seemed to leave Ukraine in shock and in places without heavily fortified regular forces the Russians seemed to drive mostly unrestricted deep into the country. The leadership in Kyiv has often been criticized for not mobilizing sooner and a failure to block roads with mines and demo bridges. This is unfair I think as the leadership was trying to not panic the country and send the economy reeling and therefore provide Putin a victory without ever firing a shot. But it does seem that the early days was a happy time of kilometers made by the Russians in several areas. 

I honestly am not sure that the US surveillance being provided to Ukraine has seen any benefit of a very recent program like Assault Breaker II, if anything it has more pieces of the original flavor. With the JSTARS flying around the borders of Ukraine. I do not know if these systems are able to see all the way to the front lines from Poland, but I have no doubt that the satellites can. 

&gt; Assault Breaker leveraged existing airborne surveillance and targeting programs: the Army’s helicopter-mounted Stand Off Target Acquisition System, an airborne targeting system similar in concept and operations to the Air Force’s E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System. The first production version of the Sentry was delivered in 1975 for testing and evaluation and entered operational service with the 552nd Airborne Warning and Control Wing, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, in 1977. During Air Force demonstration flights in Europe, Sentry operators discovered that autobahn traffic was being picked up on radar, fueling interest in a ground moving target indicator radar.

&gt; Existing efforts to develop a long-range synthetic aperture radar for the high-altitude TR-1 surveillance aircraft were adapted to modify the radar for an aircraft called PAVE MOVER – which became the basis for the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS). JSTARS remains a key legacy of Assault Breaker.

&gt; While multidomain battle emphasizes fighting across all domains — land, air, sea, space and cyber — the evolved concept recognizes that in a contested environment, the joint forces won’t have dominance across the entire spectrum.

I have never been a fan of the 'fight in all ways' theories of warfare, because this seems astoundingly obvious to me as most wars have been fought this way in history. But the point about the fight for the US being in a real contested fight where they do not have unrestricted air dominance and indeed dominance is contested in all areas, is a real thing that we need to recognize and prepare for. 

The fight in Ukraine will be more similar to how the US would have to fight a peer/near peer than many realize. Rear areas of assembly and lines of communication will be targeted by adversaries, which ISIS and the Taliban were never able to accomplish. 

My personal take on many of these developments is that information for targeting is getting better, cheaper, and more widely available to adversaries. And the ability to hit and kill these sensitive things with advanced missile tech is a hard lesson that the US is going to have to learn. Dispersing and moving forces to avoid devastating early attacks is going to vital in any future conflict. 

Even the US has experienced these things before with Iran hitting US bases Iraq with ballistic missiles, and Saddam's forces hitting a stationary barracks in 1991 with a ballistic missile.

It used to be that these precise, fast, and long range munitions were rare and expensive. A few of them making headlines at the start of a war then the stocks depleting quickly, with the result being that the rest of the war proceeded without them having an impact. This is of course not the case in Ukraine with Russian still hitting targets deep in the country after almost 10 weeks of war. 

Couple this with the knowledge that China has the largest missile forces in the world, and targeting islands where it is hard to hide, and we are looking at a paradigm shift in how a war with China would look compared to wars in the past. The reforms the US needs to be doing are shown by the USMC with its *Force Design 2030* and it should be applauded as forward thinking and bold, of course.

Key Takeaways

Russian forces engaged in several unsuccessful ground offensives to the south of Izyum and did not significantly advance efforts to encircle Ukrainian troops in the cauldron to the southeast of Izyum and west of the Donetsk-Luhansk frontline.
