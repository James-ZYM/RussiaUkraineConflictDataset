China's expansionism is purely protecting trade routes.  That's what the whole South China Sea and XinJiang situation is about.  One is for rail, the other is for ocean transportation.  China will do everything it can to make sure their products get out and are safe.

China did not have this non-expansionist ideology for a century.  In fact, China was pretty expansionist at the beginning of the century as you noted with Tibet.  However after the Sino-Vietnam war, China has stopped any ideas of expansionism.  I'm pretty sure gaining control of land in Vietnam and not know why they are even there, thus returning the land and declaring victory and leaving is the last time China had any expansionist ideas.  It's a really weird situation because right after that Vietnam declared victory and the two sides have been somewhat bitter about it ever since.

So the current Chinese government is very anti-expansionism.  Largely due to their history of expansionism where they were confused and felt like they made huge mistakes.  China will never admit this, but they've turned their backs on Mao and Communism.  They've actually returned to dynastic bureaucratic rule that they've done for thousands of years.

Now to your other question, do it's neighbors or really the whole world have anything to fear from China then.  In a strange an completely unintended way, yes absolutely.  China's Westphalia ideals has created really really interesting situations.  For example, Kazakhstan stood up to Russia at the UN voting in lock step with China who basically owns Kazakhstan now.  Or Solomon Islands, signing a military agreement with China to stand up to Australia.  Both these situations are fine and not a big deal, BUT China is giving countries the confidence to do whatever they want without the fear of reprisal from western liberalism.

So what about situations where it's not so, uh fine.  Well the biggest elephant in the room is Russia.  Russia got China to say we got your back and then proceeded to genocide Ukrainians.  Afghanistan got China to say we got your back and started to oppress women again.  This is the return to authoritarianism the west keeps talking about.  Strongmen rulers feel safe with China, so they start to commit atrocities.  I expect this is going to get a LOT worse.  So no, the countries don't have anything directly to fear from China.

The Western public certainly has an overblown sense of Chinese expansionism.  Expanding its territory does not seem to be a primary aim or strategy of the CCP, but it also seems the CCP has not been alien to expansionist acts and doctrine as it has grown across the past century:

-	Invasion and annexation of Tibet
-	Five fingers of Tibet strategy which does not appear to be completely dormant as a force within Chinese political actions (desired expansionism into Bhutan, Nepal, and the Indian territories of Ladach, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh)
-	Chinese claims in the East China Sea
-	9 dashed line assertion that wildly clashes with both historical holdings and modern international agreements
-	The Taiwan disagreement that has already been discussed

It also seems like the predatory interactions that have developed out of some of China’s Belt and Road dealings should be given some consideration. 

It’s certainly true that China is primarily focused on its own economic development and does not have grand territorial ambitions in the vein of something like Imperialist Japan or the USSR. It also seems be unreasonable to say that China does not engage with expansionism and will not continue to do so as it grows. 

I’ve really appreciated your description of the exaggeration of China’s ambitions and how that misunderstanding puts the west on a collision course with it. But it appears to me as if you’re claiming that China’s neighbors do not have any need to be concerned about China’s expansionist tendencies.

In any sudden NATO-Russia conflict, the Baltics were pretty much expected to be overran within hours or days at most. They are surrounded by Russia and Belarus. They are basically indefensible, NATO strategy is probably to protect the Suwalki gap and take Kaliningrad before meaningful help to the Baltics can be sent. Although now the Ukraine war shows the incompetence of Russia, that assessment looks false but still the Baltics are not as strong as Ukraine militarily. They can't be expected to hold the line long enough for NATO forces to get deployed in force. And deploying NATO forces in numbers sufficient enough to stop the Russian advance there at the border is just huge escalation (tens of thousands would be needed), for no need since no one actually expects Russia to attack NATO - that would be suicide for them. That's also overlooking the huge costs in deploying such numbers where likely no infrastructure is yet present for them, just so they can chill in peace-time. 

Deploying to Poland is better, its more powerful than Ukraine, so we can see they are likely capable of halting the Russian advance on their own for long enough for NATO troops to deploy in force.  But still, needless escalation since they can likely hold at least most of the country long enough for a sufficient deployment of allied troops to turn the tide.

Those peace-time deployments are basically political rather than military though. So the politicians can say how tough they are on security.  Also small forces act as a deterrent, if NATO troops are present Russia knows the treaty will be taken seriously, but they are not enough to seriously worry Russia that NATO is planning an invasion.

*""As the conflict in Ukraine shows no signs of subsiding after almost four weeks of fighting even though diplomatic dialogue continues, there is much to reflect on some deeper issues of how war and conflict are likely to play out in the 21st Century. Whether it is shaping the environment before the actual application of force; the difficulties of force application in urban environments; how much force to apply to drive home expected outcomes; or what kind of external support can weaker belligerents hope to garner from the international environment, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has much to offer as takeaways.""*

*""Firstly, the utility of force as an instrument of statecraft in the 21st Century has not followed the trajectory as predicted by both practitioners and intellectuals in the recent past such as General Rupert Smith and Francis Fukuyama. While the former seriously questioned the utility of force in conventional conflict and the likelihood of war being conducted mainly ‘amongst the people’ in his bold book The Utility of Force :The Art of War in the Modern World, the latter predicted the rapid spread of the liberal world order, the continued pre-eminence of the US in global geopolitics and the declining propensity of nation-states to use force to drive political outcomes in his book The End Of History and the Last Man. Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Galwan, South China Sea dynamics and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, all point at a return to the ‘laws of the jungle’ in global geopolitics that assert the continued presence of military power at the high table of deterrence and coercion along with economics.""*

In my opinion China is right in that the US is trying to control China. That is not a mis understanding in china's part. To keep them fairly land locked.

This is not to say I agree with it, and in terms of misunderstandings, I think both countries would stand to gain much more if there was no war and there was some sort of comprehensive security agreement.

Eg Taiwan is recognised as independent by China, in exchange for free passage and perhaps the presence of a Chinese base.

Meanwhile the United States and Japan gets guarentees else where.

Probably won't happen, as the nature of China means that they will insist that Taiwan becomes exclusively theirs and US won't accept that, so as you say huge terrible flash point which has the potential to be ruinous for all involved.

""In the ten weeks since Russia began its assault on Ukraine, tensions between Russia and Western countries have been greater than at any point since the Cuban missile crisis. U.S. President Joe Biden has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin, leader of a nuclear-armed superpower, of carrying out a “genocide,” called him a “war criminal,” and stated that he “cannot remain in power.” According to U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, the United States now seeks to “weaken Russia” to the point that it can no longer threaten its neighbors. Liz Truss, the British Foreign Secretary, has called the war in Ukraine “our war.”  
Other European leaders have been more cautious in their choice of words but just as clear in their opposition to Russian aggression. “Atrocious. Unbelievable. Shocking,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said after visiting the town of Bucha in early April. The conflict has put EU members on military high alert and dramatically underlined the dangers of European energy dependence on Russia. Complacency about Putin’s willingness to use force and weaponize trade has vanished, as has reluctance to welcome Ukraine into the European Union. NATO has deployed thousands of new troops near Russia’s borders, and the alliance will likely soon add Finland and Sweden to its ranks.  
Russian leaders, meanwhile, have dramatically shifted their framing of the war—from a limited “special operation” to “liberate” parts of eastern Ukraine to an all-out existential struggle against NATO. Putin has accused the United States and others of trying to “destroy Russia from within,” and on multiple occasions, Russian leaders have threatened to deploy nuclear weapons against any country that dares intervene in the conflict.""",bd327d29bec883d5cd7c0b82bfa8252df8bd5f66,True,False,,,,,0,1651761512,,0,{},i7fimc0,True,t3_uiyvzf,False,True,t3_uiyvzf,/r/geopolitics/comments/uiyvzf/ian_bremmer_the_new_cold_war_could_soon_heat_up/i7fimc0/,1651761525,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1651732712.0,

Instead, it's continuing it's tradition of being a giant bureaucratic mess that started with Confucius.  The communist party is acting just like another one of it's dynasties.  And the communist party has returned China to it's place 3000 years ago as the producer of products for the world.  And now that China has returned to it's spot it's always believed it should be, we're also seeing it's confusion and bureaucracy doing to it, what it did to it 3,000 years ago.  Due to China not really knowing exactly what it wants and it's leaders arguing about the way forward now, since it's no longer clear once they've gotten to the point of being the producer of the world, it's once again becoming complacent and trying not to change anything while it figures out what exactly it wants to do.  Which it never does figure out and this is why they fear outside forces so so much.  They're terrified history will repeat itself.

So unlike last time they built a giant technologically advanced military.  Because last time they got crushed militarily and had a century of humiliation.  The problem is, this military, they don't actually know what to do with it.  So like EVERYTHING ELSE, they're using it as a marketing slick so they can become the producers of all things military as well and hopes the world will buy all their stuff.  But then we ask, wait, what about their soldiers, how good is their training and ability.  And as many analysts have already said, beyond corruption, their soldiers have no experience nor the right kind of training.

This excerpt from a recent piece that appeared on Lawfareblog.com provides some great context and cogent analysis of the predicament CAR finds itself in navigating the murky waters of geopolitics in 2022.

""**Filling the Void in CAR**  
CAR—arguably the world’s least developed and poorest country—is not a U.S. foreign-policy interest. The nation of five million people is still struggling to emerge from the devastation of its 2013 civil war, which killed tens of thousands of citizens, displaced a third of the population and left the country’s territory in the hands of predatory armed groups. The crisis began when a violent takeover of Bangui, the capital, by a coalition of predominantly Muslim militias triggered equally violent reprisals by Christian and animist militias, with whom the overthrown president, François Bozizé, then became associated. After an international military intervention led by France, CAR’s former colonizer, and then a period of transition, Bozizé’s former subordinate, Faustin-Archange Touadéra, was elected president.  


In 2016, pressure from the French public brought about Paris’ exit, and a U N peacemaking mission took the reins as the sole foreign supporter of the weak CAR government, under arms embargo and in control of little territory outside Bangui. The following year, when President Touadéra approached the UN with a request for arms, France’s response was both scanty and overpriced, but Russia won over the Central African leader by obtaining a formal embargo exception and delivering ample amounts of weapons as well as security instructors. The assistance program has been largely executed by Kremlin-linked Russian businessmen receiving payment in the form of mining concessions.  
In 2020, a rebellion instigated by former President Bozizé failed and a relapse into civil war was averted, in significant part owing to Russian PMCs’ and Rwanda’s support for Touadéra—a reality that Western humanitarians and government officials acknowledge in private.  


Now, thanks to the brutal, often abusive assistance from Russian PMCs, CAR’s formal military controls most major towns. During recent fieldwork, many Central Africans expressed such fatigue with the country’s long-term disorder and resentment toward rebel militias that they favor the restoration of territorial integrity by the Bangui government, even if it receives Russian PMC support.  
Last year, France postponed its usual budgetary aid to CAR, citing concerns over Russian mercenary groups’ growing influence. This and other punitive measures, by financially strangling Bangui, only push it further into Moscow’s embrace, strengthen the hand of armed groups and add to civilian suffering. If other international donors fail to provide relief aid—a prospect rendered more probable by Russia’s war on Ukraine—CAR will experience an acute fiscal crisis. And the ensuing state fragility, far from Washington’s radar screen, may bring back the bloodiest days of the 2013 civil war.  


Recent press reports of Russian departures from CAR were not borne out by Central African sources contacted by one of the authors. If Russian PMCs were indeed to leave, with no other foreign reinforcements filling the void, civilians would likely suffer more than in their current predicament. Despite the numerous crimes committed by the Russians in CAR, their presence still contributes to stability by preventing rebel armed groups from exacting collective revenge and causing mass displacement. Growing indifference to the country from the United States and its European partners explains part of this tragic dilemma.""",b4733da98367db7e73d3b65fc8133d366484c839,True,False,,,,,0,1651749033,,0,{},i7ett5a,False,t3_ui4rqz,False,True,t1_i7epgya,/r/geopolitics/comments/ui4rqz/central_african_republic_abuses_by_russialinked/i7ett5a/,1651749047,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1651720233.0,

In fact numerous times in the 20th century the US seriously subverted  the UK (see for example suez). After all their key foreign policy goal for a long time was to destroy the empire/s. Fortunately in the post empire/ Nato world we are in a position where we (brits) can't make major foreign policy decisions without the blessing of the US anyway, so that's not much of a problem any more.

There is a group of companies that are very well known to be associated with Russian mercenary operations. One very famous one, Evropolis.

So that has been well-documented and that, you know, that particular company of has been the subject of a great deal of scrutiny from U.S. authorities and has been properly sanctioned because it is an entity that does exist legally in St. Petersburg, Russia. There are lots of other companies affiliated with Evropolis or at least believed to be linked to Yevgeny Preghozhin’s empire. However, there is no Wagner Group company. There is no LLC Wagner Group, right?

In the public discourse, China has managed to create an impression globally that “India does not feature prominently in Chinese strategic calculations”, and that it views India primarily “through the American lens”. However, a very different picture emerges when one studies the Chinese internal literature on India and the strategic relationship between the two countries.

China seeks India’s cooperation to weaken the United States’ Indo-Pacific strategy, because, in the Chinese assessment, India is the “key variable” determining the success or failure of the strategy. It's Two Oceans Strategy scheme designed to create a China-centered Indo-Pacific depends on a friendly (or atleast neutral) India. And besides, a peaceful relation with India allows Beijing to focus solely on the Eastern frontier. This understanding of the importance of India for Chia's rise is nearly universal.

However, there are two schools of thought on how to achieve it:

1. the optimistic school of **Major Power Diplomacy,** in which India is wooed to hedge against the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy and making it a key partner in the Belt and Road Initiative, and
2. the pessimistic **Neighborhood Strategy,** of securing a China-centered regional order with Beijing as the sole leader or rule-maker in the region, by suppressing India.

It is the existence and the struggle between these two schools that has given rise to the schizophrenic India policy from China, where a Chinese leader offers peace while it's soldiers clash with Indians at the same time. Since 2013, these two schools have waxed and waned in importance within China's strategic community, with the **Neighborhood Strategy** school becoming dominant by the beginning of 2020, leading to Galwan clashes.

The gruesome clash caused public outrage in India, and anti-China sentiment reached its peak. Meanwhile, in China, a sense of shock over the rapid deterioration in China-India ties was palpable. But the two schools again disagreed with each other on the way forward. A portion of the strategic community defended Beijing’s actions on the border with India, while another offered strong criticism of Chinese behavior. However, both groups agreed that it was in China’s interest not to publicly project India as an “enemy.”

For India, the lesson should be to no longer fall for China’s long-standing and highly successful propaganda strategy of outwardly trivializing India’s capability and role. India would do well to come to terms with and perhaps leverage its increasing strategic value to China, whether in the realm of China’s foreign policy or its future development strategies,  allowing it to shape Beijing’s behavior and extract adequate benefits from it.",0dde777dc48be8a566cc2524a9f80274aa775f59,True,False,,,,,0,1651726386,,0,{},i7e1e29,True,t3_uipiu2,False,True,t3_uipiu2,/r/geopolitics/comments/uipiu2/chinas_evolving_strategic_discourse_on_india/i7e1e29/,1651726400,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1651697586.0,

Territorial conquest has declined because it makes less and less economic sense and the rise of nationalism makes it far more trouble than its worth:

To quote the “[dirt theory of conquest](https://www.theatlantic.com/daily-dish/archive/2006/09/i-need-dirt-and-i-dont-care/233635/)”:

“Sailer's Dirt Theory of War: In the past, when thinking about whom to conquer, the key fact was that most of the value of the potential conquest was in the dirt acquired. You could use the ground to raise crops or mine for valuable minerals, which made up two large parts of the economy back in the good old days. War couldn't hurt dirt. Conquering California in the 1840s, for example, did almost zero damage to the place, which turned out, immediately afterwards, to have lots of gold in the ground.

Today, though, most of the asset value of a territory is in the buildings on top of the dirt, which are very easy to blow to smithereens during the course of modern war. And if you don't raze your enemy's cities, they provide formidable makeshift fortresses for conducting resistance to your invasion. So, you just can't win. The expected profit isn't worth your trouble. You might as well stay home.”",2377f33db53203b99e0e3bb777e2663b5cf3abb4,True,False,,,,,0,1651721844,,0,{},i7dtcq1,False,t3_uhze2z,False,True,t3_uhze2z,/r/geopolitics/comments/uhze2z/countries_rarely_act_fully_in_their_selfinterest/i7dtcq1/,1651721855,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1651693044.0,
