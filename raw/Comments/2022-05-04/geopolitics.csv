&gt; Your point about the Kosovo war probably reflects a difference in how we see the conflict. In my opinion this war for Russia is about territorial gain (closer to defensible Borders), demographics (taking in the largest population of Russian speakers outside of Russia),

Sorry yeah I'd agree with this. In that regard it's multifaceted. They clearly want to seize a land bridge to crimea and 'detach' the russian speaking lands.

Alternatively however, secession is illegal in ukraine and they were arresting anyone who advocated for it (they demanded the arrests of eastern polticians for discussing it before the donbas conflict started). Much like they refuse to consider allowing any sort of regional autonomy to the eastern provinces. the crimean referendum may well be considered illegitimate, but western polling since seems to indicate that mass popular support for joining russia very much exists... just as it did in the 90s when ukraine was first independent.

There are obviously huge amounts of obfuscation going on, but isn't self determination part of democracy? Hell 40 odd people were burned to death in odessa for advocating *federalism* ffs. Not even secession. From everything i can tell the political climate was dire in 2014, and arguably has gotten far worse now after 8 years of consistent moves to essentially ban russian and russian language from public life. It's telling that the day after seizing power, the new government's first move was to remove russian as an official language. That's.... not the act of an inclusive government seeking to bring people together and ease tensions whilst looking forward to a 'bright democratic future'. IMO Maidan and everything surrounding it is ludicrously misrepresented in the west. But hey.... we didn't like russia and wanted to neuter them so great work i guess.

'protecting the oppressed russians in ukraine' is very much a nationalist/imperialist sentiment, but then so is 'protecting the oppressed democrats in taiwan'. Both are simultaneously about imperialist strategic desires, whilst also underlined by a close affinity to the group you feel you are 'protecting'. That is to say, we wouldn't defend taiwan on the basis that it's democratic, but because we want to contain china. However the fact that it's democratic makes it a much more appealing and 'morally righteous' decision. the same applies here. The motivation is primarily geostrategic, but the bonus of helping 'oppressed russians' is a nice addition.",b9aca23772a08b6dfc1f7e078f7f297a611752ce,True,False,,,,,0,1651686442,,0,{},i7bhvr0,False,t3_uhvxm8,False,True,t1_i7b9h3j,/r/geopolitics/comments/uhvxm8/the_west_vs_the_rest/i7bhvr0/,1651686455,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1651657642.0,

Now to be clear, Wagner pretty consistently has terrible discipline compared to let's say troops in Western interventions or even Western Private Military Corporations and these sort of atrocities are unfortunately common, but most African countries don't really have a choice. 

The only people willing to send troops into the CAR are Wagner and Rwanda. Western countries seem to be wholly unwilling to send meaningful military aid or boots on the ground into many of these African countries. 

So where else can legitimate governments turn? Without outside intervention, the CAR's civil war will return to the previous phase where control of the government changed several times as the fortune of different militias changed. The status quo at least offers a semblance of stability to half of the country

If we take your preferred course of action and declare Wagner a terror group and indirectly declare the CAR government a state sponsor of terrorism, then what? The rebels will obviously get a massive boost, many more people will die and more people will fall under rebel control which is usually much more brutal than Wagner's

If the West wants to take action against Wagner like your suggesting, the only way it would be at all morally justifiable would be if it provided an alternate arrangement to the CAR and other African countries to stabilize the situations in their nations.

So they're mercenaries doing the bidding of the government, but the government is also not responsible?

Mercenaries in general are a hugely problematic issue and in all likelihood they should be banned globally to some extent, but they also work for their paymasters. In fact the whole point of mercs is that they're basically unaccountable and can do what governments can't. 

Hell the syrian conflict basically devolved into mercenaries fighting mercenaries. Even terrorists hire them these days. There are literal jihadi mercenary groups like the uyghurs.

I don't inherently disagree with the actions in isolation (though the sanctions are potentially very problematic - We better not see a repeat of the popular suffering in iraq in the 90s).

In simple terms however every single thing we've done or said has been laced with hypocrisy. I've been forced to completely rethink the way I see western military action, and frankly now I've gone from broadly thinking intervention is a useful tool to being almost totally against it without full international consensus.

There's also the problem of denying eastern ukrainians agency and framing it as an invasion rather than an intervention. To pretend that there was no justification behind russian ukrainians wanting at least autonomy is laughable revisionism caught up in western mythmaking about the maidan revolution. I genuinely struggle to see how this is any different to the kosovan war.

The west isn't just saying 'this is wrong and shouldn't be happening' either, they're espousing moral and legal *principles* to justify why russia is in the wrong. The same principles that we ourselves have repeatedly ignored.

I genuinely laughed aloud when the US and UK governments repeatedly attacked russia for violating the sovereignty of another country, ignoring international law and committing war crimes.

You cannot use morality to attack someone when you do not possess the moral high ground. And especially you cannot attack someone based on a principle that you demonstrably do not hold or consider yourself bound to.

Beijing abstained on U.N. votes condemning Russia and voted against the resolution to suspend the country from the Human Rights Council. Chinese media reiterate, with some fidelity, Russian propaganda about “denazifying” and demilitarizing Ukraine and blame the United States and NATO for the war. They have questioned whether the Bucha massacre was carried out by Russian troops and have called for an independent investigation.

I'm so tired of the way we report on this kind of stuff. The only people i've seen in china actively arguing that bucha was a western/ukrainian plot was a random academic (i haven't actively been looking in fairness. Happy to be shown otherwise). For some reason we deem everything that happens in China as 'the chinese state' and it's a bit ridiculous. Someone on weibo makes an image attacking the US? Blatant *chinese state propaganda*! You might as well report the views of infowars as the official US position.

The same applies pretty much universally, where we take for example the statement of a random politician as being the official government line, or the view of the entire country. This is clearly ridiculous. Random politicians say all sorts of nonsense. It's not helpful, but it's also not very meaningful beyond being an example of stupid rhetoric.

The russian 'rebuttal' has certainly been reported..... but the entire western media also reported on it, because it's part of reporting to report the official response to an issue.

I just flicked through the links provided here and absolutely nowhere is anyone actually *endorsing* the russian narrative from what i can see. There's just a difference of perspective, whereby we in the west think ourselves to be morally righteous actors and interpret any criticism as being 'in support of the other side'.

Well yeah. I've got family working in the construction business and in the Marseille area in France it's impossible to do business without greasing a lot of hands (they say it's the company that greases the most hands that gets the contracts). This is happening everywhere to different degrees. See what I mention about my country afterwards.

&gt; The use of bribes also preys on the knowledge that the authorities in 3rd World Countries are weak and incapable of dealing with corruption effectively.

The weaker the public institutions in an area, the more illegal stuff is going to happen, of course. That's exactly what I was saying. Businesses will do whatever they can in order to accomplish trade (buying, selling, doesn't matter). I'm not saying that's right. I certainly don't think so. I'm just saying that is the force at play here, not a conspiration of some sort.

&gt; Where bribes have failed, brute force, including military action, has been used to secure the desired interests.

While I'm sure it has happened in some cases (the banana republics for the US being the most egregious cases, or a little bit more subtly the influence of France in former african colonies), I really don't think that is anywhere close to the rule in the 21st century. 

Actually it's interesting to see that France couldn't do it in former colonies such as Vietnam that already had strong institutions. It could only target weaker ones. Like I said, politicians are often tugged between the ruthless amoralism of businesses, and the moral considerations of their country's educated class (if there's one). So yes, in some cases they act more like the former.

&gt; The two best examples I can think of are Shell's pollution scandals in Nigeria and Nestle's history of depleting ground water sources near impoverished communities.

Fair enough. And those companies would almost certainly do the same back home if they could get away with it... They actually already do, when they can. I mean, hell, that's what the European Union is fighting for right now against the largest american IT companies.

Unfortunately only governments can hold businessmen accountable.

&gt; but that doesn't absolve the morally-corrupt businessmen from the criticism coming their way.

&gt;Pollution? ""It's the Westerners outsourcing their industry! Nevermind that we welcome it and we profit from it!""

This line alone shows how out-of-touch you are. Literally nobody from South Asia uses that argument, because they have absolutely no problem with industry being outsourced to their countries. Yours is literally a ""privileged-westerner"" talking point. The ACTUAL argument used by South Asians, is that [their per-capita emissions are a *minuscule fraction* of the west, and are actually *significantly below* the global average too](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/large_kePCK0HLTQKXVdeUPyWox-9UOczHUF49FvzSDvUuBR0.png), and that they deserve a chance to build industrialized modern societies for themselves, while the west needs to be the one cutting back on their absurd pollution levels. Perhaps try talking to real people, before trying to mock them.

&gt;Corruption? ""Blame it on Western bribes""

Again, you'd be hard-pressed to find even one actual South Asian who doesn't openly acknowledge local/domestic corruption being a systemic problem. You continue to prove you're totally out of touch with reality.

&gt;Instability? ""Westerners funding seperatists! Colour revolution! It is not possible that our own people might be unhappy and might have their own agency to oppose the Government!""

Cute how you're pretending that the US hasn't been [toppling legitimate governments worldwide for at least 70 years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgydTdThoeA). Mostly for their own monetary or strategic gain. Hey, who remembers when the US sent the 7th Fleet to enable and support the Bangladeshi Genocide? Oh yeah, you guys are such angels. - quick edit: ""you guys"" includes you and your ilk who continue covering for the US Government and their revolting policies.

&gt;Political instability a la Pakistan? ""It's a secret Western plot to coup our leader and install a pro-West puppet""

Just because Pakistan is a failed state doesn't absolve the US of responsibility. Next you'll be telling us the Mujahideen had nothing to do with the US and it's all a big conspiracy theory too. haha

Then you have politicians, who both want to help their businessmen establish trade (more revenue for their own country, better prospects in elections ,etc.), and usually tend to support human rights, if not in an effective manner at least the optics of it. 

So... 

&gt; Bribes to the elites

Yeah, when the elites ask for them. In countries that  don't, businessmen are perfectly happy not to bribe.

&gt; causing suffering to the average people

How? Not sure what you mean.

&gt; lecturing them with moral self-righteousness

You mean like when Biden talks to Saudi's king about Karshoggi's murder, and the latter goes into a fit over it? Is that what you call ""lecturing them with moral self-righteousness""?

Iran and Azerbaijan have very different histories. Iran is a contender for the title of ""civilisation state"" , a kind of political entity that has a common cultural and political association that trumps narrower ethnic divisions and has the ability to survive even external invasion due to the endurance of a collective public perception of a shared identity.  One can look at how various different empires arose from the Iranian Plateau, reconstructing the political unity. Even ethnic minorities like the Turks or external invaders like the Arabs ended up taking cultural elements from the Persians rather than being able to eradicate it, with their governors often integrating into the Iranian cultural arena whenever they sought political independence. Iranian culture would even spill into other empires with this prolonged cultural contact, including the Ottoman and Mughals. Iran has, for the last few centuries, lost much of its historical  power in large part due to colonialism. Right now, the Iranians are quite confident of their own legitimacy as the inheritors of a long history. They want a friendly neighbourhood so they can have their needs met, just as historical empires expanded outwards to gain resources. This means they want to ensure that their countries have allied governments, being willing to go as far as intervention to obtain this outcome. To Iran, it must reach outwards to get outer countries to accommodate its needs by becoming allies.  

Azerbaijan, however is an entirely different ""beast"". It is actually a very young state, having previously only been created in the aftermath of World War I. Before that, there had been close cultural ties between the Turkic groups of what is now Northwestern Iran, Eastern Turkey and Azerbaijan, forming a single broad community that interacted with one another frequently. It was only the impositions of external empire that divided these people into separate lands. As such, there was not much of a distinct ""Azerbaijani"" identity in the past. Instead, the local political system consisted of mini-states like Shirvan that were often forced into alliances or outright conquered by their larger neighbours. The Turks of Azerbaijan had in fact been part of the Safavid Iran until Russian expansion carved their land from Iran and placed it under Russian cultural domination instead, which caused a bit of cultural drift. It was only at a time of extraordinary imperial decline that the people of Azerbaijan were able to create a political unit that represented their specific community, the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. Even the name ""Azerbaijan"" was appropriated from the neighbouring region of Iranian Azerbaijan to evoke the historical longevity of the latter. All of this reveals a young nation with a new identity, trying to create its own independent existence while existing among far larger countries waiting only for the right opportunity to destroy it.  And even then Azerbaijan was immediately seized upon by the Soviets when they became strong. It was only amidst the Union collapse that they tasted true self-governance again. And that was tainted by the traumatic experience of the Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict, which showed clear as day how weak the new country was against another country with a much longer heritage. Azerbaijan felt weak, vulnerable and it wanted to avoid being further attacked by its stronger neighbours by seeking the help of other countries. Even Iran, which controlled their Turkic cousins, might someday be persuaded to turn on Azerbaijan itself. So Azerbaijan felt it could not trust Iran. And so Azerbaijan looked further abroad, trying to find new countries it could befriend in the full knowledge that they were too far away to even want to conquer Azerbaijan. This included making alliances with the West, incentivised with offers of petroleum. And more importantly, they sought the help of the cutting-edge military technology of Israel to reverse the military imbalance it had with its neighbours. Although Azerbaijan is officially Shi'ite Muslim, its religiosity was greatly diminished due to Soviet rule, motivating them to seek the practical advantage over any supposed religious solidarity with other countries. In any case the shared religious identity had not superseded realistic limitations, and Iran had also not helped Azerbaijan with Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan was unlike the Hezbollah or Houthis, for whom Iran was the distant assister they could depend on against their closer enemies, since their danger could come from Iran itself. Iraq is a special case due to its unique political situation of Shi'ite dissidents fighting an anti-Iran Sunni regime, so Iran was the obvious benefactor for these groups, but even these have lately started to turn against Iran's attempts at controlling politics. Fundamentally being of the same faith does not mean people will agree on the same things, as they have other perceptions and needs.",508a3e586d5819ab460e3a9f7d0f469919a01ebf,True,False,,,,,0,1651640904,,0,{},i799ctx,False,t3_t90bmh,False,True,t1_hzssxj0,/r/geopolitics/comments/t90bmh/russian_policy_concerning_azerbaijanarmenia/i799ctx/,1651640917,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1651612104.0,

The way West deals with non-Western countries switches between three modes: bribes to the elites to allow national exploitation, causing suffering to the average people, and lecturing them with moral self-righteousness. 

* Bribing the elites might bring West into good graces of the top percent, but the average person on the street will dislike the West for ruining their country by creating corruption and oligarchy (see, Saudi Arabia, Latin America, etc.). 
* And if the elites refuse to tow the line, the full brunt of the economic, diplomatic and military might to bear in order to make the lives of average person hellish, in hope that this will lead to destabilization (i.e., so called ""Colour Revolutions"" that Putin and Xi are scared of); and while that may actually happen (it usually doesn't), the new regime won't forget the suffering wrought on them by the West. 
* And finally, when things return to some soft of normalcy, the same Western countries come and tell their victims how they should be more moral and ethical, just like the Western people, never mind the suffering they went through; the hypocrisy inherent is so acidic then that it burns, never mind the tinge of notions of racial and cultural superiority. And any protestations to express this are met with accusations of bringing up irrelevant past (""just forget about colonization, it was so long ago""), what-aboutism, or propaganda (""so many Russian/Indian/Chinese/African bots around here"").

Is it truly a surprise that when push comes to shove, non-Western leaders decide to abstain, wanting to neither alienate the West , nor go against popular sentiment of their people?

As long as Western politicians, bureaucrats and analysts keep looking at this as ""support for Russia"", they won't understand the reality of what is going on. They need to start thinking of it as ""opposition to the west"", and understand the source of this sentiment.

I want to kill one particular criticism of this argument in the bud. Certain surveys are usually brought up that claim that people in non-Western countries have a highly positive opinion of Western countries, and thus the above argument is faulty. This criticism is invalid, since a country is not an atom, and positive views towards a country could mean any number of things. One could see USA positively as a destination of emigration, be ambivalent about its leaders, and absolutely hate its diplomats. One could have positive relations with people of UK, and dislike its leaders.

I'm skeptical that any scenario where China and Russia's fates are intertwined can be considered a positive development for the US. 

What is it we exactly expect Europe to *do* once their throw themselves in line with the USA's anti-China platform? Write a few angry letters? Sanction the Chinese but not enough to actually damage their own economies? 

Or are we under the illusion that Europe has the capability to actually interfere with China in its own backyard? Same Europe who's premier militaries ran out of bombs in Libya, just across the pond in *their* backyard. 

Europe will contribute absolutely nothing to a Chinese conflict. Its the US that will doing the heavy lifting and its the US that will have to operate with much more caution now that their heavy handed post-cold war foreign policy has undone decades of work with regards to keeping Eurasia fractured and unwilling to form a bloc. 

China has around 300 nuclear weapons. Lets assume that they are lying and they've stashed twice that number without us realizing. That's significantly *less* of a problem in a first strike scenario than the thousands of nuclear weapons that Russia has scattered all over their territory and the oceans. In a potential war against China where Russia is apathetic to the outcome, the US maintains the option of first strike if things get too hairy. 

If the current trend continues, the US will need to account for the Russian nuclear arsenal, which in turn means that they'll need to be reasonably confident that they'll be able to ""win"" conventionally.

TLDR; Its in no way a good thing for the US that China and Russia have buddied up.",c9b17b83d15c3cf2c6d594de22568a3d569de75c,True,False,,,,,0,1651626041,,0,{},i78f3gp,False,t3_uefckh,False,True,t1_i6pldyd,/r/geopolitics/comments/uefckh/xis_global_security_initiative_looks_to_counter/i78f3gp/,1651626060,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1651597241.0,

While the job opportunities provided by the US are certainly welcome, looking at it geopolitically, stopping this would halt the brain drain that's been happening for decades now.
