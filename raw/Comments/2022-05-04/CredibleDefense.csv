Same as it ever was. Our strategic defense systems have always been viewed as offensive in nature by the Soviets and I imagine the Chinese are no different - and their answer will be the same. I think it has value in the near term as the author described, but the long term result (our adversaries building huge nuclear stockpiles) will simply continue to be a conundrum. 

&gt; The current deterrent to limited nuclear strikes on the US is massive US retaliation

Massive US retaliation against theater, tactical nuclear strikes on the other side of the world from America is not credible. Our own tactical nukes in the same theater is - and that theater includes the Chinese homeland which IMO makes our low yield initiatives stronger for deterrence. 

&gt; It seems to me that the conventional deterrence by Taiwan itself to deny China a victory is the most powerful tool available to keep peace across the straits.

This is impossible though. China's advantages are practically insurmountable if they were really motivated. Avoiding a  quick fait accompli is the best Taiwan can hope for, on its own.

[],False,,SirWinstonC,,,[],,,,text,t2_jahj9,False,False,"Actually not true, supersonic missiles are categorically bad for AShMs compared to subsonic missiles



Supersonic flight requires a lot more fuel to go the same distance as does subsonic. So for any given distance a supersonic missile will be dramatically larger and heavier than a subsonic missile. The larger/heavier missile size limits the launch platforms that can be employed and/or the number of weapons that can be carried per platform. The air-launched version of the joint Indian/Russian BrahMos requires a specially modified Su-30MKI heavy fighter, which can carry a single missile. The BrahMos has a range of 500km. Not that the U.S. and India are ever going to war, but think about this as a Russian weapons system. U.S. carrier-based aircraft could easily shoot down the modest number of Su-30MKI‚Äôs capable of carrying the BrahMos before they came within range of the Carrier Strike Group. If a few do manage to launch, the Carrier Strike Group posses considerable ability to prevent them from striking any ship. It takes a saturation attack to have a reasonable chance of causing significant damage to the CSG, and the Su-30MKI/BrahMos combination can‚Äôt get through the CSG fighter screen to launch a saturation attack. What it could do is keep the CSG‚Äôs fighters busy enough that other platforms carrying subsonic missiles can successfully reach their launch points. Meanwhile, all 48 F/A-18E/Fs (surging to 60‚Äì70 in wartime) on board a U.S. carrier are capable of carrying two LRASMs with similar or greater range and larger warhead. The upcoming JSOW-ER will give the F-35 a similar capability while operating in stealth mode. In beast mode it might be capable of delivering 4 or more JSOW-ERs (as would the F/A-18E/F). So beyond the benefits of carrying 2‚Äì4+ times the ordnance, and doing so on mainstream rather than specialized platforms, we get to the technical reasons for supersonic vs. subsonic weapons.

There are two variants of supersonic anti-ship missiles. The first is Supersonic All The Way, the second is Terminal Supersonic. The benefit of Supersonic All The Way is that the missile closes on the last known ship position more quickly, reducing the chance that the ship has moved out of the missile‚Äôs ability to find it. This benefit can be negated by better offboard sensors (e.g., patrol aircraft, satellites, etc.) that can provide guidance updates along the way, as well as better sensors and longer search radius. Subsonic‚Äôs lower fuel burn rate certainly lends itself to extended searches better than a supersonic missile. As the U.S. and others deploy very long range anti-ship missiles, they see themselves as well positioned to provide guidance updates and have the missiles autonomously find the target ship. Thus Supersonic All The Way does not offer as much in the way of improved targeting as it did when the Soviet Union first focused on supersonic missiles. Terminal Supersonic is a tradeoff that was made to reduce missile size and weight. The missile travels subsonically until it enters terminal phase, then accelerates to supersonic speed as part of its evasive maneuvers. While supersonic speed does complicate anti-missile intercepts, it too has downsides. For example, infrared sensors can track a missile traveling at Mach 1.2 at twice the distance of a missile traveling at Mach 0.8. Defensive missiles like the RIM-116 RAM use infrared (and passive radar) for their terminal guidance, so can lock on to the supersonic missile more easily than they could a subsonic missile. This will apply to many other sensors as well. An IRST on a fighter could much more easily pick up a supersonic missile than a subsonic one, allowing it to target an incoming cruise missile with its own weapons or pass guidance information to a ship-launched weapon like the SM-6.

The U.S., by contrast, has focused primarily on stealthy weaponry. Both of the latest anti-ship missiles, the LRASM and NSM, as well as the upcoming JSOW-ER, are stealthy. While this is often meant to indicate they have low radar cross-section, it also means they focus on Infrared signature reduction. As already stated, the higher the speed the more detectable the Infrared signature. So if one is focused on evading enemy defenses using stealth then supersonic missiles are counter-indicated.

That said, the U.S. and other countries are now focused on a mix of subsonic and supersonic anti-ship weapons. The SM-6, primarily an air defense weapon, is considered an anti-ship weapon as well. It is a high-supersonic speed weapon. The SM-6ER will have longer range, potentially a larger warhead, and is rumored to achieve hypersonic speeds. Overall in a major naval conflict one could expect the U.S. to use MST, NSM, LRASM, JSOW-ER, SM-6, AARGM/AARGM-ER (another supersonic missile), future hypersonic cruise missiles, as well as other weapons (e.g., Stormbreaker, JSOW C-1, Paveway II/III, Maverick). It‚Äôs a pretty broad spectrum with differing capabilities and benefits. And supersonic and hypersonic play a role, but compatibility with a wide range of launch platforms and stealth for survivability remain primary considerations.",20c0e63ab2fc5484b967ddb438b623b8f445363b,True,False,,,,,0,1651703795,,0,{},i7cpzsp,False,t3_74f4h0,False,True,t1_i7cob42,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/74f4h0/ussoviet_relative_technological_level_in_deployed/i7cpzsp/,1651703806,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651674995.0,

The Black Sun (German: Schwarze Sonne) is a Nazi symbol, a type of sun wheel (German: Sonnenrad)[1][2] employed in Nazi Germany and later by neo-Nazis and in some strains of Satanism. The symbol's design consists of twelve radial sig runes, similar to the symbols employed by the SS in their logo.[note 1] It first appeared in Nazi Germany as a design element in a castle at Wewelsburg remodeled and expanded by the head of the SS, Heinrich Himmler, which he intended to be a center for the SS

In 1933, Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS, acquired Wewelsburg, a castle near Paderborn, Germany. Himmler intended to make the structure into a center for the SS, and between 1936 and 1942, Himmler ordered the building expanded and rebuilt for ceremonial purposes.[5] As a product of Himmler's remodeling, twelve dark-green radially overlaid sig runes, such as those employed in the logo of the SS, appear on the white marble floor of the structure's north tower, the Obergruppenf√ºhrersaal, or ""General's Hall"".[note 1]

The intended significance of the image remains unknown. Some scholars have suggested that the artist may have found inspiration from motifs found on decorative Merovingian disks (Zierscheiben).[note 2]


The Black Sun symbol is widely used by neo-fascist, neo-Nazi,[6] the far-right and white nationalists. The symbol often appears on extremist flags, t-shirts, posters, websites and in extremist publications associated with such groups. Modern far-right groups often refer to the symbol as the sun wheel or Sonnenrad.[5][7][8]

The name ""Black Sun"" came into wider use after the publication of a 1991 occult thriller novel, Die Schwarze Sonne von Tashi Lhunpo (The Black Sun of Tashi Lhunpo), by the pseudonymous author Russell McCloud. The book links the Wewelsburg mosaic with the neo-Nazi concept of the ""Black Sun"", invented by former SS officer Wilhelm Landig as a substitute for the Nazi swastika and a symbol for a mystic energy source that was supposed to renew the Aryan race.[3][4][9]

A number of far-right groups and individuals have utilised the symbol in their propaganda, including the Christchurch mosque shooter Brenton Tarrant and Australian neo-Nazi group Antipodean Resistance, and the symbol was displayed by members of several extremist groups involved in the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.[10]

Along with other symbols from the Nazi era such as the Wolfsangel, the Sig Armanen rune, and the Totenkopf, the black sun is employed by some neo-Nazi adherents of Satanism.[11] Scholar Chris Mathews writes:

The Black Sun motif is even less ambiguous. Though based on medieval German symbols, the Wewelsburg mosaic is a unique design commissioned specifically for Himmler, and its primary contemporary association is Nazi occultism, for which Nazi Satanic groups and esoteric neo-Nazis adopt it.[11]

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, NATO tweeted a photo of a female Ukrainian soldier for International Women's Day. The soldier wore a symbol on her uniform that ""appears to be the black sun symbol"" (because the symbol is the same color as its surrounding uniform; it is difficult to see.) After receiving complaints from social media users, NATO removed the tweet and stated ""The post was removed when we realised it contained a symbol that we could not verify as official."" The Ukrainian Azov Battalion has used the symbol as part of its logo. [12]

I think it is hard to claim you know something until you can make a case for it convincingly. But I feel that the case made in this article is an incomplete argument that does not go far enough to examine the counters and consequences for the policies that it is advocating for. 

It is absolutely true to say that the opinions in this paper represent the views of many smart people and it is important to see things from all sides, and it significant due to that fact alone. And I strive to submit articles about national security issues that I both agree with and do not agree with.

This article made the case for a missile defense system to allow the US to maintain a missile defense system to deter from a limited first use attack, or the threat of one. 

&gt; * the value of U.S. missile defense for the credibility it could provide for U.S. nuclear escalation deterrence threats. In this case, however, the value is in helping to deny China any expectation that it can wield credible limited nuclear first-use escalation threats.

Which sounds fine until you realize that the US currently has a deterrent for a limited first use attack against the US, and that is its own nuclear weapons. And further the implementation of such a system would diminish the deterrent value of the current Chinese nuclear deterrent, thus provoking them to build more weapons to ensure it has a credible nuclear deterrent. Exactly how this vicious cycle is stopped or stabilized is not addressed and I currently do not have an answer for it. So although I have read some works on this idea, I do not find it compelling or believe that it would have the effect of stabilizing and preventing war, or at least a period of further tensions. If anyone can help me see or understand this issue in a different way then please chime in. 

&gt; And, to strengthen the U.S. non-strategic regional deterrence position, the United States should remain committed to fielding low-yield nuclear weapons on strategic missile-carrying submarines, low-yield precision strike capabilities for the bomber force and non-strategic, dual capable fighter aircraft, and to the nuclear-armed, sea- launched cruise missile (SLCM-N) on both surface and sub-surface vessels.

This is another thing where I have trouble understanding the author's logic. These weapons would not add much to the overall strategic nuclear deterrent of the US, in my understanding. The current deterrent to limited nuclear strikes on the US is massive US retaliation. Does anyone really think that a nuclear weapon used against the US will not be perceived by the US as an existential threat? How would a US under nuclear attack be able to tell that the attack is going to be limited, so it can then choose not to pull out the SIOP?

It seems to me that the conventional deterrence by Taiwan itself to deny China a victory is the most powerful tool available to keep peace across the straits. And that carries the benefits of being the option with the least expenditure of funds, and the least likely to escalate tensions, as it maintains China's deterrence of being able to strike Taiwan but not successfully invade it. As well as incentivises Taiwan to keep the status quo to avoid the costs of China's conventional attacks.",aee30fbd214968968e18ca7b6554991441efa6f4,True,False,,,,,0,1651701207,,0,{},i7cjpb8,True,t3_uigw3g,False,False,t1_i7cfhbz,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uigw3g/deterring_china_a_victory_denial_strategy_the/i7cjpb8/,1651701226,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651672407.0,

[],False,,bleepblopbloopy,,,[],,,,text,t2_4lu6l,False,False,"&gt; * The United States faces a deterrence challenge wholly unlike those of the Cold War‚Äîhow to deter China, as a great power, from invading Taiwan. 

&gt; * ‚Ä¶Beijing that has staked its legitimacy, to a large extent, on nationalism and the related promise of incorporating Taiwan into the political structure of the mainland.1 The CCP leadership perceives this as an existential goal and failure to achieve unification as an existential threat. 

 &gt; * ‚Ä¶China has worked for decades to shift the local balance of immediately-available military power for this purpose in its favor. 

&gt; * ‚Ä¶the United States may be able to deter China from deciding to resolve the Taiwan Question forcefully, but the challenge is severe. 

&gt; * The United States cannot realistically expect to compel the CCP to end its aspiration to incorporate Taiwan into the mainland‚Äîdoing so would be contrary to the CCP‚Äôs core identity and threaten the legitimacy of its rule. 

&gt; * Successful deterrence in this case is limited to the U.S. political goal of continuing to prevent the CCP from deciding to forcefully eliminate Taiwan‚Äôs political autonomy 

&gt; * The United States, from China‚Äôs apparent perspective, is at a deterrence disadvantage over the Taiwan Question. The likely reasoning for that perspective is clear: China has greater stakes involved in the Taiwan Question, a favorable local balance of power, and, because the United States has eschewed defense of the homeland against great nuclear powers, the United States faces an existential risk if a regional conflict over Taiwan escalates to the level of nuclear threats. Consequently, the CCP appears to deem Washington to be less able and willing to threaten, engage in, or escalate a conflict to defend Taiwan than is China in its pursuit of unification. In this context, the credibility of any implicit or explicit U.S. deterrence threat to engage in an escalating conflict is likely to be suspect. 

&gt; * China‚Äôs perception of an asymmetry of stakes and its capability to threaten the U.S. homeland with devastating strikes may allow it, even encourage it, to engage in coercive nuclear threats against the United States and its allies if necessary to succeed. 

&gt; * In short, the U.S. deterrence strategy must deny China the expectation that it has escalation dominance vis-√†-vis the United States and allies regarding the Taiwan Question. 

&gt; * For deterrence purposes, it is of singular importance to remember that the CCP leadership will determine whether the ‚Äúcosts‚Äù threatened by U.S. and allied officials are sufficient to deter it from changing the status quo on Taiwan forcefully. That is, Beijing ultimately determines the adequacy of U.S. and allied deterrent threats, not Washington. 

&gt; * In response to this deterrence challenge and the disadvantageous political and military conditions surrounding the Taiwan Question, the United States and its allies should adopt a new victory denial deterrence strategy, one that incorporates military and non-military deterrence tools, including some in the realms of diplomacy and economics. To support this deterrence strategy, the United States must deny the CCP any confidence in a regional fait accompli, i.e., deny the expectation of a quick local military victory, and any confidence that threats of escalation, including limited nuclear escalation, will provide the solution to the prospect of a local victory denied. This is a deterrence strategy to deny China escalation dominance; it is not a strategy for U.S. escalation dominance or pretending that escalation dominance is within the U.S. grasp in this case for the foreseeable future.3 Notions of U.S. strategic nuclear superiority and ‚Äúvictory‚Äù‚Äîand the deterrence dominance that could, in theory, follow from such capabilities, are implausible. But the conditions needed to deny China its notions of victory, and the deterrent effect that could follow from a victory denial deterrence strategy, are likely the best plausible option for U.S. officials to strive for with regard to the Taiwan Question. 

&gt; * Why may a victory denial deterrence strategy be adequate in this particular case? The answer is clear: the CCP has resorted to nationalism as a primary rationale for its rule. In doing so, it has elevated successful unification with Taiwan as an existential goal‚Äîif attempted forcefully, failure would be a wholly intolerable repudiation of the legitimacy of CCP rule. 

&gt; * This reality may provide great motivation for the CCP to escalate to win any such conflict, but it also provides a point of great CCP deterrence vulnerability and deterrence leverage for the United States, i.e., a U.S. victory denial deterrence strategy carries tremendous potential leverage for effective deterrence, without demanding the condition of U.S. escalation dominance. 

&gt; * A victory denial deterrence strategy is not unprecedented. The United States employed just such an approach to deterrence against Moscow during much of the Cold War‚Äî a history the United States can build on to adapt to current requirements.4 

&gt; * At the conventional military level, a victory denial deterrence strategy includes the requirement for U.S., Taiwanese, and allied forces that can be employed rapidly and are resilient enough to stalemate an invasion force‚Äîwhether quickly or over a lengthier period of time through defense-in- depth. 

&gt; * And, to strengthen the U.S. non-strategic regional deterrence position, the United States should remain committed to fielding low-yield nuclear weapons on strategic missile-carrying submarines, low-yield precision strike capabilities for the bomber force and non-strategic, dual capable fighter aircraft, and to the nuclear-armed, sea- launched cruise missile (SLCM-N) on both surface and sub-surface vessels. 

&gt; * a condition the United States must create to make a victory denial deterrence strategy most likely to succeed is a system of damage limitation that does not depend on U.S. nuclear escalation‚Äîi.e., active and passive homeland defenses. 

&gt; * In the past, missile defense advocates, including Herman Kahn and Colin Gray, emphasized the value of U.S. missile defense for the credibility it could provide for U.S. nuclear escalation deterrence threats. In this case, however, the value is in helping to deny China any expectation that it can wield credible limited nuclear first-use escalation threats. 

&gt; * The U.S. ability to defeat a limited missile attack on the U.S. homeland would help to eliminate the CCP‚Äôs capacity to threaten the U.S. homeland with coercive limited strategic nuclear escalation‚Äîdoing so may be essential to the credibility of a deterrence strategy that denies the CCP the anticipation of escalation dominance. 

&gt; * ‚Ä¶U.S. and allied officials should address possible military gaps and expand the ‚Äútoolbox‚Äù of a victory denial deterrence strategy to include military, economic, and diplomatic tools. This process of coordinating various possible tools of state power to deter China may be understood as a real-world application of the Pentagon‚Äôs newly announced expressions of ‚Äúintegrated deterrence.‚Äù6 

&gt; * For example, a potential deterrence tool under the victory denial banner is the U.S. and allied pursuit of a ‚Äúporcupine strategy‚Äù for Taiwan to deny the CCP any anticipation of a rapid fait accompli and brandish the prospects of the intolerable consequences of a drawn-out conflict over Taiwan. 

&gt; * A second potential tool is the development of a U.S.-led alliance structure or structures intended to help deter China in general, but also to help preclude the CCP‚Äôs anticipation of a rapid fait accompli. 

&gt; * A third possible deterrence tool available to the United States and its allies is the advanced preparation of a broad economic and financial package of sanctions, tariffs, and other monetary tools that could be used in a coordinated fashion internationally should China invade Taiwan. 

&gt; * Finally, a fourth deterrence tool consistent with victory denial is a concerted effort to communicate to the CCP leadership the potential nuclear proliferation consequences of an attempted or even successful invasion of Taiwan.7

[],False,,robothistorian,,,[],,,,text,t2_2inubrvw,False,False,"&gt;* &gt;A comparison of Armenian and Azerbijani defense expenditures as a percentage of GDP reveals Armenia was not devoting a considerably larger share of its available national resources to defense. During the period 2000‚Äì19, Armenia‚Äôs military expenditures as a percentage of GDP averaged 3.65 percent, not much higher than Azerbaijan and its average of 3.44 percent. Moreover, there have been periods when Azerbaijan‚Äôs military expenditures as a share of GDP exceeded Armenia‚Äôs expenditures by 0.3 to 0.9 percentage points (in 2006 and 2011‚Äì15).7 In this regard, a legitimate question to ask is whether Armenia was serious about its defense. With significant dissonance between military reality and investments, Armenia proved unready for the war and ‚Äústeadily marched toward a military disaster. 

This is an odd argument. I say ""odd"" because defence budgets compete with the budgets of other ministries/departments for a share of the country's fiscal pie. Without knowing the specific pulls and pressures on the Armenian national budget, its immediate critical needs and competing necessities, it is difficult to assess the intent of the author of this piece (who is a member of the Armenian military). I have yet to come across any military official who is either (1) satisfied by the existing military budget, or (2) did not want the military budget to be increased.

&gt;* &gt;These mobile groups could exploit the seams in the Armenian battle line of troops stretched thin along the perimeter of the forward edge of the battle area and attack objectives deep in the Armenian rear. This tactic exploited the other chief shortcoming of the Armenian army‚Äîa lack of mobile combined-arms and artillery units.

This is interesting. However, it's not novel. If one looks back at the Second World War, this description would probably apply to the Wehrmacht on the Eastern Front especially from 1943. Thinned out divisions manning extended fronts were the norm. This allowed the Soviet armies to launch probing attacks and when either lucky or when they had the appropriate intelligence, they would pierce the front preferably along the line separating two defending units. This allowed the Soviets to launch deep penetration attacks followed by encirclement battles (not all of which were carried out successfully). Notice one thing though - while I am pointing to this being a Soviet thing, it's was not a Soviet innovation. The Wehrmacht itself used to engage in these types of operations in the pre-1943 timeframe but much less so - for obvious reasons - after 1943.

This then begs the question: Why was the ""Armenian battle line of troops stretched thin along the perimeter of the forward edge of the battle area""? The author says that  ""This tactic exploited the other chief shortcoming of the Armenian army‚Äîa lack of mobile combined-arms and artillery units."" But is this necessarily the only way to have deterred Azerbaijani offensives? Why could not a ""defence-in-depth"" (albeit supported by mobile formations) be designed? After all, it would make sense to crush the Armenian offensive formations and then to launch aggressive counter-offensives. This would have allowed the Armenian forces to have gained the ""defender's advantage"" (compelling the Azerbaijani forces to commit to overwhelming a 3:1 attack ratio) and it would have (theoretically) given the Armenian forces the opportunity to move onto the offensive in a manner reminiscent of Manstein's ""back-handed"" operational option, which he displayed in the Ukraine battles in 1943.

&gt;* &gt;The mismatch between Armenia‚Äôs and Azerbaijan‚Äôs ways of war and was most apparent in the fight for Shushi, the strategically crucial town whose seizure decided the campaign‚Äôs fate. While the Azerbaijani army managed to bring its mobile assault units to the outskirts of Shushi, effectively sealing off the roads to the settlement, the Armenian command assumed its enemy‚Äôs infantry could not cope with the Armenian units without the support of tanks, artillery, and UAVs.10 The problem was the continued reliance on Soviet-legacy military thinking and operational art without attention to the peculiarities of Armenian military culture (that proved victorious in the First Nagorno-Karabakh War) or the changing character of warfare and specificities of the theater of operations. The Soviet military school overly focused on mathematical algorithms and operational art and had a hard time clarifying the boundary between the latter and military strategy, instead emphasizing human and material resources to be expended in attritional warfare.

This is also an interesting point. While the author hauls up Soviet operational thinking and roasts the Armenian military for slavishly following it, one wonder whether the Armenian mitsty actually followed the lodestone of Russian military thinking - ""the deep battle"" - as they prepped and/or faced their adversaries? Further, though the author seems to make a big deal about innovation and invokes Kuhn's ""paradigm change"" argument, it's interesting to note that it was the Soviets who actually identified the key ""paradigm change"" in modern warfare when they theorized about the ""reconnaissance-strike-complex"" (RSC) and the attendant Military-Technical Revolution, which they came up with by carefully following the US military's conceptual work involving the [Assault Breaker ](https://www.darpa.mil/about-us/timeline/assault-breaker)and now [Assault Breaker 2](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2021/03/09/pentagon-scientists-mull-a-big-problem-how-to-destroy-a-whole-lot-of-chinese-ships-and-russian-tanks/amp/) initiatives.

Innovation is not merely doing ""new"" things for the sake of doing ""new"" things. It also does not necessarily call for the introduction of new technologies. Innovation in the military context - at its most foundational level - is all about working out novel ""concept-technology pairings"" (one classic and somewhat recent example of this was the Chinese ASBM project, which put together 3 ""old"" technologies - MARVs, OTH radars/Ocean Surveillance SATs, and the IRBM - to come up with a weapon system that was considered serious enough for the [US Navy to take a step back and to reconsider its options.](https://www.andrewerickson.com/2020/11/the-china-anti-ship-ballistic-missile-asbm-bookshelf-3/). 

&gt;* &gt;Whereas the Armenian forces fought according to the primer‚Äî Soviet doctrine of land operations dated 1989‚Äîthe Azerbaijani army had adopted the concept of light composite assault units in the early 2010s. 

It is interesting to read this because this was approximately the model that Rumsfeld was trying to implement during his tenure as Sec of Defence and, by all counts, it failed. Of course, there are many reasons for its failure but it needs to be flagged that ""light composite assault units"" are just that - ""light"" - and they can't be expected to do much more than to lead the assault. It's the follow-on formations that consolidate and exploit the gains of these kinds of formations.

&gt;* &gt;Indeed, bureaucratic infighting was in full swing in the Armenian military, whereby the parochial interests of various branches of the armed forces made the strategic planning process of the Armenian Army difficult to implement. 

I am not sure there is any military bureaucracy that does not have this kind of infighting and service-specidic parochialism. Indeed, such things are also rife in the best of civilian organisations!!

&gt;* &gt;The General Staff ‚Äôs organizational culture was antithetical to the idea of revising Armenian military doctrine. At the same time, the officers with Western professional military education who were aspiring military mavericks alluded to by Posen were largely barred from promotions to key decision-making positions.37 This factor impeded innovation, and it runs contrary to Rosen‚Äôs key argument that attributes innovation‚Äôs success to the creation of new promotion pathways for young champions of reform within the officer corps

This could very well be true. But then again, this is a common refrain in all military organisations. One only has to read about the US Force Transformation Project led by the late Admiral Cebrowski to confirm this. That said - and perhaps I am more cynical than most - I could not help noting how self-serving this assertion is. Naturally, the author would - given his ""education"" at the Naval Postgraduate School (i.e., a beneficiary of ""Western professional military education"") - count as being a ""maverick"" and thus be qualified for promotion pathways! Of course, this does not mean that the author is not qualified and/or competent enough to be promoted or that his ideas - specific to the Armenian military - are not innovative.

[],False,,jrex035,,,[],,,,text,t2_2k929ak,False,False,"&gt;is it still a war for national survival if Russia says to the Ukrainians that they will make no further offensives?

Absolutely. Russia has antagonized Ukraine directly since 2014 and then launched a full scale invasion that was clearly intended to peel off huge portions of Ukrainian territory, decapitate their government, and leave them a Russian-vassal state. Ukraine has zero reason to trust Russia if they say they're not planning any future offensives. It's obvious Russia would try to attack them again the second they think they're in a position to do so. 

&gt;Are Western Ukrainians willing to semi-indefinitely fight to retake Donetsk and Luhansk, and basically kill every eastern Ukrainian fighting aged man who's been forcibly conscripted by Russia to defend that territory?

Impossible to tell, but I expect Ukrainians will continue to fight so long as they think they can win and kick Russia off their land. 

&gt;Or would Ukraine be satisfied with a truce (though not necessarily a lasting peace agreement) to buy time to regroup, properly incorporate their new weaponry, before having another go at it in like 8 years (i.e. similar to what happened following Russia's 2014 invasion)?

Why would they? From their perspective they've got Russia by the balls now, why would they seek a truce? You really think Ukraine *wanted* an 8 year long frozen conflict before this war? With all the devastation this war has wrought, I expect Ukraine to keep fighting until they win and can essentially end the existential threat that Russia poses, so that they can finally rebuild and move on.",5d4b24cac958f80bad3f152b9ac6cb2178e95287,True,False,,,,,0,1651696068,,0,{},i7c6k34,False,t3_ui4xlp,False,True,t1_i7bopbw,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ui4xlp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_04_2022/i7c6k34/,1651696079,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651667268.0,

By all definitions they still are, note that I haven't said superpower which arguably there's only one of or zero currently depending who you ask and Russia would under no circumstances qualify, but they're still certainly a great power, and a hostile one at that.

&gt;It would have PREVENTED an entire war

Or escalated NATO-Russia bloc tensions well beyond what was the previous highest point during the Cold War, it's completely nonsensical thinking that if acted upon, would set a new precedent that would get us closer to a world war than anything before it. Do you also think the Soviets should've dumped their army and nuclear missiles stockpile into Cuba and just told the Americans to bugger of because Cuba is acting on the will of it's people, wanting to engage with the USSR instead of having their government run by a failed US sponsored dictator? Probably not yet because it's what you're suggesting here, despite the fact that this would've been the kind of hostile escalation never seen during the Cold War in our timeline, I certainly doubt it would've prevented any potential war, more than likely it would've started one if anything. And the US was right to be concerned about the Soviets encroaching upon their Western hemisphere regardless of what Cuba wanted, and the Soviets thankfully weren't complete lunatics like the US would be in your scenario today, so both parties withdrew and deescalated the situation. What you're implying is that in a similar situation, instead of any sort of compromise or common agreement between nations, the US should've just put their dick out on the table, put Ukraine, under the NATO umbrella in less than a month, and see what happens, which according to you would've actually prevented the war instead of making things worse.

&gt;And ""spheres of influence?"" This isn't the 19th century.

Just because the US stopped caring about it thinking they could enforce their will over any country on the globe since the whole world became their backyard after the Cold War, it doesn't mean everyone else also stopped caring about their own interests. With little variances, the US to this day still maintains essentially maintains the Monroe doctrine, the fact that the OEA is now at the forefront changes very little and we can see how they react whenever something would upset the continental status quo, this is only natural as it is in their best strategic interest to dominate the entire Western hemisphere to the point of it being their home ground.

The Warsaw Pact's main purpose along with all the other border republics was to defend the Russian heartland from any invasion and to provide warm water ports for the Union, just because the Soviets collapsed the need for these same things didn't go away. Until recently, Russia was all about maintaining what's left of it's old sphere of influence by keeping Belarus and Ukraine close while building relations with bordering countries and disrupting Western organizations that brought ex-Warsaw Pact countries under the EU-NATO umbrella. Just look at the Georgian invasion which was essentially hard response for the country eyeing with NATO membership.

China being the rising star is also looking to establish their own, hard sphere of influence which has been hampered by the US aligned Philippines-Taiwan-Japan trio, the entire pacific plan of containment hinges on this trio standing strong and putting a hard block on any ambitions China would have when it comes to pushing their influence in East Asia, in response they've been establishing themselves elsewhere like in Africa and in the Middle East while they continue steadily building up for a potential conflict. It's absolutely ridiculous to suggest spheres of influences don't exist anymore or that they're no longer relevant to how states conduct themselves when the top economical and military powers of the world are pushing so hard for expanding their reach or sabotaging their rivals' reach.

The US has simply forgotten the art of statecraft after the Cold War despite the rules of the game not changing whatsoever, as the US' position weakens in the world again, the leadership is slowly relearning age old concepts like spheres of influences and how to deal with the various great powers of the world. Under Biden the US has been very slowly relearning how to conduct itself thankfully, while your thinking is a remnant of the recent past, one that didn't work for the US during the 2000s and it certainly it wouldn't work now in Ukraine.

&gt;The difference of course is that we didn't facilitate their creation within our 'home territory'. It would be like creating the legal national entity of Yorkshire within the UK (region in the north of england). People in yorkshire have a pretty strong sense of regional and cultural identity, their own dialect to an extent etc. there's even a minor (albeit semi-ironic) yorkshire independence movement. But that's NOT the same thing as an independent national identity. In the same way that russians in st petersburg or vladivostok will have their own regional identity, but consider themselves part of the same national structure.

No, Lenin did not create a Ukrainian nation from a ""home region"" like St Petersburg or Vladivostok. The idea of there being three brotherly nations, that is Great Russians (Russians), Small Russians (Ukrainians) and White Russians (Belarusians) has been a thing for centuries before Lenin and was even noted on Russian Empire's ethnic maps. So Lenin just gave these nations administrative borders, like he gave ones to many other nations within Russian Empire. He did not invent anything new. Sure, the idea that these ""three brotherly nations"" don't exist and it's actually one nation is also pretty widespread, especially amongst Russian nationalists, that you seem to like repeating after, but just because they like to say how Lenin came up with Ukrainians doesn't mean they are right.

&gt;I mean it seems to me that you don't want to understand the context within which he was speaking.  
  
'Decommunisation' basically means removing Russia/russian from ukraine and rewriting the history books under the guise of removing the USSR. Thus threatening them with 'real decommunisation' it just an aggressive nonsense threat as far as i can see. Your interpretation is the.... exact opposite of decommunisation. If he gave them 'real decommunisation' then He'd be doing the exact opposite of what he wants.

Here's the guy behind 'decommunisation' btw. Essentially in charge of creating a new national myth of ukraine and behind a lot of the radical nationalism that now dominates the country's politics. In fairness to Zelensky he's clearly very uncomfortable with the idolisation of Bandera et al.

You do understand that what you said makes no sense?

It seems to me that I understood Putin perfectly and you also understood Putin perfectly. You just don't want to believe that Putin was serious and come up with some silly reasons of why, like Putin could not be serious because Putin used a word ironically and not literally.

Equipment-wise, Russia will be losing all their latest military equipment and end up with an army and air force from the 50s and 60s.

Ok but this is a bad comparison imo.

This is a tough one to game out. If you do assume Ukraine is an existential threat to Russia, like Putin might, which route has the best relative odds of defusing it?

It seems like shifting to a defensive posture, maintaining a blockade, and doing your best to rebuild your global relationships, economy, and military over the next decade is the better odds. Figure out some sort of temporary settlement that keeps Ukraine without security guarantees, do what you can to choke out their economy, and hope the West loses interest in rebuilding Ukraine once the war is over.

That's definitely a long shot, but so is mobilization, which comes with a lot more risk. So, I don't know that Putin viewing Ukraine as existential means you necessarily get a mobilization.

No they don't. The entire point of their internal security apparatus is to prevent that, why Putin created the Rosgvardiya. It's why protesters are immediately locked up. It's why a Russian gets 15 years in prison for mentioning that this is a war and not special military operation.

And that still doesn't address that Russians support Putin during this war. Even the Western media has admitted that despite their distrust of the polls there is no indication that Putin's hold has weakened; if anything it's grown stronger, and that is despite western media blitz actively trying to force a coup back in March. At this point it's pretty clear most will do what he wants them to and believe what he wants them to believe. Not all, but enough. 

And among the power elite, they want this war to end too, since they're the ones the sanctions are targeting. They arent political ideologues who are willing to die for their beliefs, they're economic plutocrat oligarchs who exist to make money because money means power. The only detriment to ending the war for them as well as the hardcore nationalists is ego and pride but that can be satisfied if Putin's propaganda apparatus can frame what's happened already as a win.

They're more fucked than you realize.

It would take months to get reservists into combat. It would likely take at least a year but probably longer to get conscripts into b combat that were levied after a mass mobilization effort was ordered and executed.

Remember, the latest crop of 12 month conscripts being indicted now are NOT meant for combat arms, nor were they even supposed to deploy. If Russia declares war they can use them in foreign wars, they can keep them in uniform indefinitely, but they still need to train them as infantry, tankers, artillerymen, recon specialists, or engineers, all of which takes time to do it even badly. Plus there are a hell of a lot of very complicated support positions within the Russian Armed Forces that need to be filled that have much longer schooling they can't shorten much. Plus they need more officers. 

There is no real point to mobilize only enough to reconstitute the current force in Ukraine as that's a bandaid for a sucking chest wound. The current force at its height was proven to be too small to do its job, it needs to outnumber the Ukrainians at least 2:1 if not more. Plus, about 2/3-3/4 of all Russian ground combat units are in Ukraine right now, their borders are mostly bare, they can defend Russia without nukes and that needs to be fixed too. And there is no strategic reserve uncommitted that they can use to rotate units in and out of Ukraine, because they can't keep the same ones fighting indefinitely. That means massively expanding the size of the military's ground combat units with supporting enablers. 

The shit they need to do will take years, at least two, before any meaningful change happens that could benefit Russia. 

Look at the US Army in WW2. It activated the National Guard in 1940 and together with a few intact prewar regular army divisions some of them entered combat from mid to late 1942 and were known to be unprepared. It enacted the draft in 1940 as well but the first draftee divisions didn't enter combat until mid 1944.

You seem to be interpreting it as a criticism. That it was essentially a political creation by someone else doesn't mean it's not real. I'm british. We 'created' more countries than anyone else. 

The difference of course is that we didn't facilitate their creation within our 'home territory'. It would be like creating the legal national entity of Yorkshire within the UK (region in the north of england). People in yorkshire have a pretty strong sense of regional and cultural identity, their own dialect to an extent etc. there's even a minor (albeit semi-ironic) yorkshire independence movement. But that's NOT the same thing as an independent *national* identity. In the same way that russians in st petersburg or vladivostok will have their own regional identity, but consider themselves part of the same national structure.

I mean it seems to me that you don't want to understand the context within which he was speaking.

First, it would take a minimum of 3 months for Russian conscripts to get trained. On top of that, the Russian training program typically involves placing conscripts for training with their unit. That can't happen as their units are all already in Ukraine fighting, so these troops would receive substandard training. 

Second, it takes longer than 3 months to train NCOs and officers, and Russia is already seeing lots of these men get killed in the fighting as is. So any newly formed units from mobilized conscripts would have not enough/poorly trained officers and NCOs too. 

Third, Russian equipment losses have been staggering already. Russia's modernized and most effective fighting vehicles are already in Ukraine, meaning mobilized troops would be equipped with whatever Soviet-era surplus vehicles they can get up and running.

They have no good strategic options left anymore because of the idiotic way they've pursued this conflict. Russia's current offensive is already showing signs of slowing down, and its nowhere near achieving its objective of encircling Ukrainian troops in the JFO. This offensive was their last hurrah too, after this it will take months before they're ready to go on the offensive again. During that time frame, newly formed Ukrainian units will arrive in the tens of thousands, alongside advanced Western equipment like suicide drones and long-range precision-guided artillery that will negate Russia's artillery advantage. 

Even if Putin ordered mobilization today, it's unlikely to change much on the ground. It would take months for new Russian soldiers to make it to Ukraine, and these new conscripts would be much more poorly trained, poorly equipped, and poorly led than the troops Russia already has in theater. It's also questionable if the Russian military would even be able to support a large influx of troops logistically. Importantly, Russia's best troops are already in Ukraine and have suffered terribly so far. Russia has no strategic reserve to call on. I'm also doubtful Russia will be able to keep up the missile strikes that much longer, they've already fired more than 2,000 and even the US would struggle to maintain 1,000 missiles a month indefinitely.

[],False,,OhSillyDays,,,[],,,,text,t2_h1c0qtwi,False,False,"Russian apathy comes out in different ways than a straight revolt. 

Russians just don't give a shit about their job. And you can see it with the way the officers are doing their work. They are not spending time planning attacks, gathering intelligence, or disciplining their military. They are spending their time stealing from the military and getting drunk. They only time they seem to attack is when an officer comes to the front and forces them to move.

And it seems like the officers have been hand selected because they have drank gallons of the koolaid, which means they are morons. The are few officers that haven't bought the propaganda and still have a head on their shoulders are probably a rare breed. Probably the only good officers they have. The only evidence I have for this is the one officer talking to the news about their progress in Mariupol. 

Additionally, Russia has a tendency to treat their people like animals. To be pushed and forced and to not have any empathy for them. If you treat people like that, you get what you ask for, cattle. They don't think, they don't believe in the objectives, and they silently revolt. 

In this type of environment, you'll see the apathy kill the military in a few ways.

* Lack of training. You see evidence for this in the way the soldiers move on the field. 
* Fear driven motivations. The only thing that moves them forward is fear of their commanders more than the enemy. Don't expect any sophisticated tactics. 
* Corruption. Focus on stealing equipment in order to sell equipment on the black market. Use that money for immediate relief from the pressures of war - drugs and/or going AWOL. 
* AWOL. Conscripts are known to go awol at high rates. In Ukraine, that becomes a serious problem because they can go to the Ukrainian side and be treated pretty good. 
* Quiet rebellions. I'd expect people in the entire population to approach doing their job with apathy. Show up late. Do a shit job. Not care about safety protocols that could destroy a building. That sort of thing. Unless an officer is there to yell or beat on them. 
* Hatefulness. The psychological impact can be seen all over the Russian population. Hate for the enemy. Hate for the government. Hate for themselves. Creativity and effective fighting forces do not work well in this sort of mental mode. Creativity is a necessary component to invasion. Creativity dies with hatefulness. 
* Quiet sabotage. A worker is beaten by his boss, so the worker burns down the factory. This type of thing is probably getting more prevalent in Russian society. 
* Laziness. Just being lazy is a way to not participate in something you hate. 

So I'd expect the type of revolt in Russia to not start out loud and obnoxious like Americans. Everybody in Russia knows that an overt show of sabotage would be punishable by death or worse. So they'll instead perform the sabotage quietly. Nothing you can put your finger on, but everybody knows it is happening and they can't blame a specific person. Because if they can blame someone specific, that specific person will be hauled away.

If fires in Russia keep growing, I'd think that's a strong indicator that Russian society is quietly rebelling against the government.",e60ca1d7b15c9e09f76e0b68c2933d3a416ba520,True,False,,,,,0,1651678531,,0,{},i7ay3r6,False,t3_ui4xlp,False,True,t1_i7asf0u,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ui4xlp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_04_2022/i7ay3r6/,1651678548,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651649731.0,

The upshot is..... yes, they'd be unable to hit it with enough explosives to take the bridge down.

Missiles wouldn't do it. Bombs wouldn't do it. Even spec ops infiltrators coming by submarine couldn't do it (unless they literally carried tons of explosives with them).

Maybe ramming a pylon with a boat filled with TNT could do it.

Part of the problem is that its not even really one bridge, [its two](https://imgur.com/RYn040a).

Its beyond Ukraines capabilities, and (if Ukraine held it) probably beyond Russias to take it down absent a nuke. 

America might be able to do it, but it'd take being willing to lose a lot of planes to rpeated attacks through anti-air defences.

Putin could die unexpectedly in his sleep due to a heart attack, could be assassinated by a anti-war protester, killed in a military coup, arrested in a military coup, flees the country to a friendly country like Syria, flee the country to somewhere like Switzerland in a negotiated settlement, etc., etc. and those are just relating to Putin. There's then several scenarios which follow each of those examples. But vis-√†-vis Ukraine, these are the scenarios I see. All of those above scenarios result in one of the three outcomes with regards to Ukraine. The putschists are moderates, who accept blame and leave Ukraine (scenario #3). The putschists are extremists who nuke Ukraine and others (#2).

But on writing this, I've realized there is another obvious  scenario (#4): Russian begins winning (which on its own has a few sub-scenarios to what constitutes ""winning""), which basically means Russia to dictate the terms of its victory, which, while far fetched, could theoretically stem from China throwing its full military weight behind Russia, or key Ukrainian leadership being killed, collapsing Ukrainian morale.

And a 5th, perhaps the most likely scenario, Russia and Ukraine accept a compromise that allows both Putin and Ukraine to claim victory to their people, or at least simply pause hostilities until a later date.

Still, I think it would be interesting to work through each of these scenarios to look at  how to avoid #2 and facilitate #3 or #5 (and keep doing the best to make sure #4 doesn't occur).",69f2ec958a5130f76eadfa563043fdb275488486,True,False,,,,,0,1651676710,,0,{},i7atiet,False,t3_ui4xlp,False,True,t1_i7anb0x,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ui4xlp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_04_2022/i7atiet/,1651676726,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651647910.0,

Some key things about Russians that Western people misinterpret:

1. If a general mobilization was announced today, Russians wouldn't suddenly revolt. I see a lot of Western commentators still argue that it would cause an uproar, but in reality, Russians would probably try to silently avoid getting drafted as they have done for decades. 

2. Russians are apathetic and highly adaptable. For decades now they have gone through periods of deficits, defaults, and complicated politics. The war is already impacting the common Russian, but the common response is ""we've had worse"" and ""we'll find a way to live"". 

3. Russians are proud &amp; stubborn. This isn't a national quality, but a lot of the population is unable to admit faults in the way their government acts.

An Associated Press investigation has found evidence that the attack was in fact far deadlier than estimated, killing closer to 600 people inside and outside the building. That‚Äôs almost double the death toll cited so far, and many survivors put the number even higher.

&gt; * The AP investigation recreated what happened inside the theater on that day from the accounts of 23 survivors, rescuers, and people intimately familiar with its new life as a bomb shelter. The AP also drew on two sets of floor plans of the theater, photos and video taken inside before, during and after that day and feedback from experts who reviewed the methodology.",135ae537a57d69dbd877bd0ba7aa355febb1e18b,True,False,,,,,0,1651674067,,0,{},i7amzvr,False,t3_ui4xlp,False,True,t3_ui4xlp,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ui4xlp/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_04_2022/i7amzvr/,1651674081,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651645267.0,

#Commentary on the communications and information capability.#

But the F-35, and F-22, (each with a different format), the datalinks are designed as low probability of intercept stealthy networks. They are not omnidirectional, but instead uniquely directed on to those aircraft in the network, communicating with each other. Packets of data are sent directly back and forth but not in a continuous stream of data as in Link 16. Intercepting that data would be cosmically difficult to do and that‚Äôs how it remains stealthy.

When transmitting through MADL, no one can find the four, or eight aircraft in the network. F-35 is not just sending position data and simple communications but exactly what my aircraft sees in data-fused packets so that everything I see is shared with everyone else and vice versa. Our situational awareness is dramatically more comprehensive than anyone could imagine.

#Discussing how completely it changes air engagements#

Kinematics ‚Äì In attrition warfare, where each airplane can see each other, whoever‚Äôs missile gets there first, hopefully kills the other airplane. With two missiles in the air there, one does not get to time out, because the launch aircraft died. You always wanted to be able to shoot first. To do that, you want to go as fast, or as high as you can to give your missile basically the fastest push ‚Äì so it would go higher, faster, and get there first, before the other person‚Äôs missile hits you. That assumes that we both saw each other. And we‚Äôve been playing this cat and mouse game of who gets missiles in the air, and who turns away from each other, to slow the closure velocity of the aircraft, as the missiles come out of each other, making the missiles fly further. It‚Äôs an old game of attrition warfare. But what happens when I‚Äôm in a very low observable F-35, and cannot be seen by the adversary, is that I to get to shoot my missile wherever I want before he (the other pilot) ever even knows I exist. My missile is in the air. My weapons bay doors have opened fired the missile, closed the weapons bay doors, and I may even have turned around, while my missile is impacting his jet. I am no longer playing the kinematic tactic that has been a part of our world for through all the years of 3rd gen and 4th gen weapons and fighters. I‚Äôm not trading kinematics as we did with 4th gen weapons.


#discussing dogfight tactics and how it compares to 4th gen#

I was originally a CF-18 pilot and then later in my career I‚Äôve spent much of my time in F-16s and Eurofighter Typhoons. These fighters have different flight-control logics. The Hornet loves to fly slow. It has that incredible capability in slow-speed maneuvering whereas the F-16, Gripen, Eurofighter and Rafale are all meant as high-speed fighters. They have 9G limits and they‚Äôre really meant to go around the corner, chasing the adversary, quickly and fast. They are beautifully flying airplanes, even at the aggressiveness of the 9G. But it‚Äôs two different philosophies. One tries to point its nose quickly at the adversary and shoot quicker ‚Äì like the F-18 ‚Äì and the other one tries to race around the circle faster ‚Äì F-16, Eurofighter, Rafale, Gripen.

The F-35 is more like an F-18 ‚Äì remember the air show demonstrations of 50 degrees AoA, and a square-loop, and pedal turn. That‚Äôs what its highlight capability is ‚Äì different than F-16 or the Typhoon. It is just a different philosophy. Where should the F-35 advantage be? As a minimum, I should enter the combat environment having seen my adversary long before he could see me with a significant advantage even before the fight starts. That‚Äôs really what the F-22 had learned over all these years. When they allow themselves to get into air combat, they have a huge advantage, because they‚Äôve seen the adversary much, much earlier than the adversary sees them, so the fight typically ends much quicker like that.


#discussing just how big the air superiority advantage it has is#


The F-35 is exceptionally capable at executing the Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses mission set. It would go in and kill every surface-to-air missile threat that was out there, and neutralize all the threats on the ground, and achieve air dominance because it would kill all the air-to-air assets also. Remember: we see them, they don‚Äôt see us. It‚Äôs like playing football, when one team‚Äôs invisible, and the other team is not with a gross advantage on behalf of the F-35. F-35 would see all the enemy air-to-air threats and kill them all, plus completely neutralizing the surface-to-air missile threat to achieve air dominance. From that point, the forces can conduct their air-to-ground war. That‚Äôs what the F-35 was meant to do.",cadc6ef0f63b395d1050e6ee7c699428982062c6,True,False,,,,,0,1651671594,,0,{},i7aha6u,False,t3_ueuaqj,False,True,t3_ueuaqj,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ueuaqj/f35_capabilities_missions_kinematics_role_in/i7aha6u/,1651671611,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651642794.0,

Quotes:

&gt; * Unleashed by Azerbaijani aggression on September 27, 2020, the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War concluded with the cease-fire on November 9, which many Armenians were quick to dub capitulation.

&gt; * The reasons for the defeat of the combined forces of the Republic of Artsakh and the Republic of Armenia in the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War are manifold. 

&gt; * These shortcomings, however, all originate from a flawed military doctrine inherited from the Soviet Union and based on attritional warfare. 

&gt; * Doctrine is defined here as the ways and methods of conducting operations or, as defined by the US Department of Defense (DoD) as ‚Äúfundamental principles that guide the employment of . . . military forces in coordinated action to achieve a common objective.‚Äù1 

&gt; * Armenian forces failed to adapt to the changing character of warfare and find viable solutions in the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of war due to a confluence of impediments to military innovation. 

&gt; * The complacency leading to Armenia‚Äôs defeat in the Second Nagorno- Karabakh War provides a critical lesson for modern militaries and their political masters: greater introspection is necessary to mitigate the main impediments to military innovation and reform. 

&gt; * Looking at force correlation at the onset of hostilities reveals the belligerents could have been assigned equal odds whereby the Armenian side had enough defensive capacity to withstand the onslaught. One analyst, citing Azerbaijan‚Äôs narrow margin in several major weapons systems, forecasted the conflict would not result in a serious alteration to borders since no side had resources to achieve a complete victory.3 

&gt; * Azerbaijan‚Äôs successful use of drones proved a tactical sensation and reaffirmed the potentially devastating effects of airpower on ground forces with unsophisticated air defenses. 

&gt; * While the increasing variety of affordable UAVs can provide belligerents with air power at a fraction of the cost of maintaining a traditional air force, ground forces trained to fight in a ‚Äúdrone-saturated‚Äù battlespace are crucial.6 

&gt; * Well-trained and skilled personnel are still the most important asset on the modern battlefield, and they are key to employing weaponry properly and defending from enemy engagement. 

&gt; * A comparison of Armenian and Azerbijani defense expenditures as a percentage of GDP reveals Armenia was not devoting a considerably larger share of its available national resources to defense. 

&gt; * A comparison of Armenian and Azerbijani defense expenditures as a percentage of GDP reveals Armenia was not devoting a considerably larger share of its available national resources to defense. During the period 2000‚Äì19, Armenia‚Äôs military expenditures as a percentage of GDP averaged 3.65 percent, not much higher than Azerbaijan and its average of 3.44 percent. Moreover, there have been periods when Azerbaijan‚Äôs military expenditures as a share of GDP exceeded Armenia‚Äôs expenditures by 0.3 to 0.9 percentage points (in 2006 and 2011‚Äì15).7 In this regard, a legitimate question to ask is whether Armenia was serious about its defense. With significant dissonance between military reality and investments, Armenia proved unready for the war and ‚Äústeadily marched toward a military disaster. 

&gt; * Whereas the Armenian forces fought according to the primer‚Äî Soviet doctrine of land operations dated 1989‚Äîthe Azerbaijani army had adopted the concept of light composite assault units in the early 2010s. 

&gt; * These mobile groups could exploit the seams in the Armenian battle line of troops stretched thin along the perimeter of the forward edge of the battle area and attack objectives deep in the Armenian rear. This tactic exploited the other chief shortcoming of the Armenian army‚Äîa lack of mobile combined-arms and artillery units.9 

&gt; * The mismatch between Armenia‚Äôs and Azerbaijan‚Äôs ways of war and was most apparent in the fight for Shushi, the strategically crucial town whose seizure decided the campaign‚Äôs fate. While the Azerbaijani army managed to bring its mobile assault units to the outskirts of Shushi, effectively sealing off the roads to the settlement, the Armenian command assumed its enemy‚Äôs infantry could not cope with the Armenian units without the support of tanks, artillery, and UAVs.10 The problem was the continued reliance on Soviet-legacy military thinking and operational art without attention to the peculiarities of Armenian military culture (that proved victorious in the First Nagorno-Karabakh War) or the changing character of warfare and specificities of the theater of operations. The Soviet military school overly focused on mathematical algorithms and operational art and had a hard time clarifying the boundary between the latter and military strategy, instead emphasizing human and material resources to be expended in attritional warfare.11 

&gt; * Scholarship on bureaucratic politics posits one such obstacle to innovation is the tendency to treat institutions like the military as a single monolithic entity rather than as a federation of smaller suborganizations pursuing their parochial interests. 

&gt; * Posen contends military organizations are reluctant to innovate in peacetime if left to their own devices. Instead, innovation is spurred by the intervention of civilian leaders, who are assisted by ‚Äúmilitary mavericks‚Äù‚Äî senior military officers who provide technical knowledge and substantive expertise. 

&gt; * One of the ways to win in the struggle for innovation is to create new promotion pathways for young officers, who advocate a new way of war, allowing them to rise to senior ranks within a period of generational change.27 

&gt; * The Second Nagorno-Karabakh War was preceded by two relatively major escalations in the conflict in April 2016 and July 2020. These flare-ups strengthened the belief of Armenian senior military leaders that future operations would be positional in nature and fought with an attritional approach against an opponent who pursued limited offensive objectives. Glaring issues identified in the wake of these hostilities in technological and operational domains were largely ignored. 

&gt; * Oblivious to these new realities following the hostilities, the Armenian side dismissed the drone threat. According to the first deputy minister of defence: ‚Äúit [is not] necessary to buy expensive drones when it is possible to hit the target with a conventional grenade launcher.‚Äù29 

&gt; * Recalling the paradigm change, expounded by Kuhn, in doctrinal matters, an innovation might have been attained in Armenia through both discovery and invention.31 First, most of the phases of cognition described by Kuhn as precursor to discovery existed. The awareness of problems in the Armenian military‚Äôs current philosophy of command and control and the larger notion of operational concepts, along with their observational and conceptual recognition, were formed long ago amongst farsighted defense professionals and consequently reflected in the high-level guidance documents issued by the minister of defense. Particularly, the ministerial vision issued to the force in 2018 and mid-2020, respectively, underscored the importance of overhauling forms and methods of warfare and communicated the imperative to eliminate complacency with outdated military thinking, weapons systems, combat manuals, and command and control practices.32 

&gt; * Driven by the legacy of the Soviet system of directive (restrictive) control, and pending explicit orders, some units fell short of taking the initiative to react to the large-scale enemy assault. 

&gt; * Indeed, bureaucratic infighting was in full swing in the Armenian military, whereby the parochial interests of various branches of the armed forces made the strategic planning process of the Armenian Army difficult to implement. 

&gt; * The General Staff ‚Äôs organizational culture was antithetical to the idea of revising Armenian military doctrine. At the same time, the officers with Western professional military education who were aspiring military mavericks alluded to by Posen were largely barred from promotions to key decision-making positions.37 This factor impeded innovation, and it runs contrary to Rosen‚Äôs key argument that attributes innovation‚Äôs success to the creation of new promotion pathways for young champions of reform within the officer corps.38 

&gt; * ...the elected and appointed civilian masters largely deferred to the expertise of military professionals, thereby playing almost no role in technological and doctrinal innovations. 

&gt; * The main reason for the defeat of the Armenian forces in the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War was their failure to carry out major innovation in military doctrine and to adapt to the changed character of war. 

&gt; * Examining the Armenian case through the lens of various established theories of military innovation leads to several conclusions, some troubling.",c529b1361f6bc506b78364ef3e3240fd855ff46b,True,False,,,,,0,1651671298,,0,{},i7agmys,True,t3_ui6lhd,False,True,t3_ui6lhd,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ui6lhd/a_failure_to_innovate_the_second_nagornokarabakh/i7agmys/,1651671313,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651642498.0,

&gt; 
&gt; According to the source, Volodin uses the Security Council meetings to ‚Äútest‚Äù the president‚Äôs mood. ‚ÄúHe listens carefully to the comments Putin seems to throw out off-handedly, then he expresses the same sentiment publicly and more clearly. He presents his ideas at the Security Council and watches the president‚Äôs reaction.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúA lot of people are afraid to speak or to act on their own behalf, and Volodin is afraid, too, but he does it anyway. He‚Äôs not the most intellectual person, but he‚Äôs able to sense quite a lot ‚Äî not with his brain but with his spine,‚Äù said one of Volodin‚Äôs acquaintances. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got an animal lust for power and a sixth sense for it. A lot of his moves are made instinctually ‚Äî he follows his nose and he knows which way the wind is blowing. He‚Äôs not a person, he‚Äôs a biorobot.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; According to Meduza‚Äôs source, Volodin‚Äôs unwavering support for Putin and his ideas come down to just that: knowing ‚Äúwhich way the wind is blowing.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúRight now, you certainly can‚Äôt overdo it with patriotism, but you sure can underdo it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúVolodin knows it‚Äôs not time for moderation, and that it‚Äôs better to go further than what the president might be expecting. When Putin mentions demanding rubles for gas, Volodin suggests demanding rubles for all imported products and raw materials. And so on. And his sixth sense hasn‚Äôt failed yet.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; He and other sources Meduza spoke to (both close to the AP and to Volodin himself) noted that Volodin‚Äôs extreme patriotism and support for the president are both pragmatic and self-serving. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt work for Putin, he works for himself. He just understands that supporting the president like this is currently what puts him in the best position. Other politicians are realizing this and beginning to copy him,‚Äù said a source close to the AP.    

And Medvedev, he used to be a butt of all jokes for being a softie during his presidential tenure. But with that said, I'm still not sure a convincing 180 is something that is possible.

Then pile on the fact that if Putin goes nuclear, regardless of how, it becomes vital to the survival of our species that he be severely punished for it so that other leaders don't do the same in their conflicts. Even China would have to condemn it, and would essentially have to take action sufficient to show Taiwan that they consider using a nuke unthinkable, otherwise Taiwan certainly would seek to acquire nuclear weapons, and would succeed.

&gt; I highly doubt that it will become one ofc, dont misunderstand, its just the avg russian birth rate is around 1.4 while their muslim population has something like 3+, at this rate it would still take 3-4 decades plus.

No, not even close. I often see arguments like this concerning ""demographic replacement"" but, when you do the sums, it takes centuries and not the decades people often talk about.

I'll run the sums for you on russia if you like. 

First, we assume (although its not a good assumption) that these rates stay the same. In reality, over the decades/centuries, muslim reproduction rates are likely to decline due to the same demographic changes that europeans experienced earlier....but lets say for the sake of argument those rates hold.

First we'll your rates of 3 muslim children vs 1.4 non-muslim children figure. That figure is *per generation*, so approx 25-30 years. We'll say 25 for the sake of argument. So in each 25 year block muslim pop would grow 50% and Russian pop decline 25%.

Currently, muslim pop. is 6% of total russian pop..... so with those assumption at what point do they cross such that muslims are 51% of total pop ? 

Well they reach 49% of pop in generation 4, so 100 years from now.... and become a majority in generation 5, so 125 years from now.

Thats incidentally in a Russian population that has declined to under 100m russians as well.

If I look up the correct values for those figures (which appear to be 1.6 for non-muslim russians, and 2.3 for muslims) .... this gets delayed even further to generation 8. 200 years from now, where the muslims become a slight majority as the Russian population declines to only 35m people and they are 18m of them.

I'd suggest that the major problem there might be the population shrinking in size by 80% rather than this making muslims a majority.... and even in this case, thats 200 years in the future and trends are extremely likely to change over that period.

Beware of anyone selling you a population replacement theory based on birthrates that talks in anything less than centuries.... and if they do talk in centuries, remind them that birth rates will vary wildly from current figures over that timescale.",b52f58165a1977548d6c952d414987d8c484b721,True,False,,,,,0,1651666151,,0,{},i7a6db0,False,t3_uheh2u,False,True,t1_i7a2z4x,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uheh2u/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_03_2022/i7a6db0/,1651666167,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651637351.0,

No, it'd be ""second use"" given the ""first"" use of nukes in the conflict would have been made by Russia.

Remind me what mutual defence treaty the US and ukraine have?

You don't just get to nuke someone because they nuked someone else, though that is of course the risk due to the inevitable heightening of tensions. By that logic if russia used a nuke on ukraine then EVERY nuclear power should be nuking russia, but we all know that wouldn't happen because they.... weren't attacked.

&gt; Thats not what ""first strike"" means.

First strike relates to a specific conflict from what i understand. If a nuclear weapon is not used against the US and its allies, then it has not been attacked, and therefore any use of its own weapons amounts to first use.

Maybe I'm missing something, but the NPT doesn't appear to offer any protection from a nuclear weapons attack to signatories. Am i missing something? It does seem like a fundamental flaw.

&gt; In any case.... I suspect the US retaliation for a use of Russian tac nukes on Ukraine wouldn't be a nuclear attack on russia, that way lies escalation.

Not far.... a few hundred meters for troops in the open ? 0 meters for troops in armoured vehicles ? Tactical Nuclear missiles typically have a blast/lethality radius of around 1km.

The cheap and easy conventional oil is in decline and what is left is difficult to extract and expensive. Oil production reached its all time high in 2018, a year and a half before the pandemic. Over the past 8 years the production costs have boomed while investments have dropped. There has been a massive shortage in investment in oil and gas for years. Oil isn't really something that is made, it is the result of long and very expensive infrastructure projects and we have spent less on these projects at the same time that their price tag has ballooned.

Oil isn't sold when it is produced, it is sold well in advance. A company spends a fortune building production capacity and then gets oil. Therefore the oil is sold early to provide investors with a stable business plan. There was already a massive shortage of oil. 3.5 million barrels a day is an enormous amount to replace and the oil that will be delivered in the coming year is pretty much already sold.

Europe isn't going to replace Russian oil. Russia can't really sell their oil somewhere else because shipping 500 million liters of toxic and highly flammable liquid from the urals to Brazil and India every day isn't something that can be set up in months.

If russia nukes ukraine.... and gets nuked in retaliation..... you would count as a first strike against Russia ?

Thats not what ""first strike"" means.

In any case.... I suspect the US retaliation for a use of Russian tac nukes on Ukraine wouldn't be a nuclear attack on russia, that way lies escalation.

I suspect it'd be a barrage of conventional cruise missile attacks on russian targets in Ukraine.... logistics hubs, arms dumps, rail lines, maybe even direct attacks on command centres and targets like that (all within Ukraine).... something that means Russia gets no battlefield advantage from its tac nuke use, and is in a worse position afterwards, but that clearly shows restraint and a desire to not escalate up the nuclear ladder. Followed, of course, by the most eye-atwering sanctions you can imagine (likely joined by China and other previously non-aligned states).

I think it'd only be if there is continued nuclear strikes by russia after this that you may see attacks on russia itself with conventional warheads and/or retaliatory nuke strikes.

Tac Nukes are small. From 1kt up to 50kt or so.

If russia set off a 10 kt tac nuke (to use as an example) over a UA troops formation..... villages just a few km away will get their windows blown out but otherwise be fine.... those 5km or more away won't even lose their windows.

Anyone within 1km of the epicentre will die, but thats not ""mass civilian casualties"" if used on a troop formation in, or outside, an otherwise evacuated village you're trying to clear in order to advance.

For example, on the Izyium axis, Russia is currently trying to push past Velya Komyshuvaka. 

[Here is a nuke map of a 10kt airburst over the UA troop positions there](https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/?&amp;psi=20,5,1&amp;linked=1&amp;kt=10&amp;lat=49.1172962&amp;lng=37.0046501&amp;hob_psi=5&amp;hob_ft=200&amp;zm=11).

I think people hear nukes and assume ""20 megaton devices going off over major cities"". 

If russia is considering anything its likely a 1kt, 5kt, 10kt device going off a troop concentration to ""clear a hole"" but also to ""make a point/escalate in a minimal way"".

Yes. He's constrained by an inability to cede territory or make any concessions really.

Say what you want about nazis, but fervent nationalism plays a massive role in ukrainian politics. As does a vitriolic hatred of russia (in the west at least, but since this conflict presumably nationwide). Also people get irrationally protective about the idea of territory and always have.

A few weeks ago he had the godlike status and political capital to potentially spin the narrative and make some concessions 'in order to save ukrainian lives'. I don't think he can do that now. Much like he couldn't make concessions to prevent the war happening because it would have been too politically damaging to him. Much like he couldn't implement Minsk 2 because the nationalists would never accept granting autonomy to the donbas (kinda ironic really)

&gt; simply that the status of Crimea in Russian social and political discourse is vastly different to that of the rest of Ukraine.

[],False,,Grammarnazi_bot,,,[],,,,text,t2_c3jag,False,False,"&gt; What incentives does Russia have to not use nuclear arms?

There are various, strong incentives that Russia has to not nuke Ukraine.

The use of nuclear weapons may completely estrange Russia from China and India; if this were to happen, it would likely spell the end of the Russian Federation in its current state, as the Chinese government would have had to have already informed Russia on their stance on nuclear arms. Reports have circulated before on China acquiescing slightly to the West‚Äôs demands out of fear of sanctions. The likelihood that China receives sanctions for continuing to support Russia after a nuclear first-strike is significantly higher than the probability that she gets sanctioned simply for continuing to do business with one of their closest current geopolitical allies.

With that being said, a nuclear first strike has a few scenarios that end in several responses from NATO, the most obvious of which is a complete embargo on all Russian trade. NATO commanders and world leaders have made vague threats about how a nuclear strike on Ukraine could spill over to their involvement. The scenario they specified was if the fallout from the strike made its way into NATO territory and threatened their lives. Due to the unpredictability of war, especially given the lack of precedent with nuclear attacks, there exist many ways through which escalation could occur that ends in NATO involvement, and enumerating them would be not only tedious, but would likely not even follow the correct sequence of events should that happen. 

However, a nuclear strike would place immense pressure on Congress to utilize their heaviest economic weapons possible, and should the onus fall on the United States to blockade Russia, it would be a declaration of war. Otherwise, the governments surrounding Ukraine‚ÄîPoland, Moldova, Romania, Slovakia, and Turkey‚Äîwould face stronger pressure to act and prevent harm to their own country. This, too, could end in another nation joining the war. These two scenarios are complete conjecture, so take them with a grain of salt.

An unlikely, but still probabilistic, scenario is a military refusal to carry out the nuclear strike.

[],False,,TheHuscarl,,,[],,,,text,t2_amv0e,False,False,"&gt;If anything it may encourage china to support russia openly

Definitely not.   


A. China does not want tactical nuclear use normalized because they are behind the ball in the nuclear department vis a vis their major strategic rivals: the United States and Russia. Tactical nukes are an easy means for the US to level the playing field with China in a conflict over Taiwan. It also gives India a justification/precedent for using nukes (again as a leveler) in the even the two fight another war. Bad news all around for China.   


B. It's a horrific violation of a longstanding international norm and China cannot be seen to endorse something that earth-shattering while maintaining its position as a state that actively supports the international system.   


C. Russia and China relations are strong, but they are never that strong. Ultimately China knows that once the US is dealt with, they'll have to deal with Russia too, either through quasi-vassalization or war. They share an extensive land border and have had conflicts in the past. If Russia uses a nuke, they are a liability as a state, as a security partner, and most certainly as a neighbor. If they used a nuke on Ukraine, literally people they claim are Russians, China knows that they will use nukes on China at the drop of a hat. Having the only state in the entire world to use nuclear weapons after the establishment of the nuclear taboo and MAD as your next door neighbor is a major major security concern, doubly so if they're a potential rival.  


D. China will almost certainly not want to suffer any sanctions by extension. They're barely giving their support to Russia right now and that's when we're still at ""special military operation"" levels. If Russia starts dropping nukes, there's no way China doubles down on their already lackluster support with the result of further isolating themselves from their major trading partners in the West and causing potential economic damage to boot.",1a1ce7a40612e62c2cb0a87cfdbb5db3d30a1fa5,True,False,,,,,0,1651647872,,0,{},i79izzj,False,t3_uheh2u,False,True,t1_i79ga04,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uheh2u/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_03_2022/i79izzj/,1651647887,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651619072.0,

(DISCLAIMER: I'm not trying to contribute to increasingly deranged hysteria around WWIII breaking out, I'm talking about a narrow hypothetical situation in which the United States learns ahead of time about Russian plans to destroy entrenched Ukrainian positions in the Donbas with low-yield tactical nukes)

Does the United States make this information public in an attempt to stop it, maybe even going so far as to release information about the target and time of the attack? This might force Russia in to backing down, but just as easily cause a breakdown of order on the Donbas front as panicked soldiers try to desert realizing they didn't sign up to vaporized by the thousands. And while American intelligence has delayed and disrupted Russian plans, publicizing information about the invasion ahead of time did not actually stop the invasion.

Does the US convey this info in secret to the Ukrainian government and let them figure out how best to handle the situation? 

What incentives does Russia have *not* to do this? Will America actually be willing to retaliate militarily? Obviously they'll become even more of a pariah state than they already are over night likely leading to a complete western economic embargo, but will China's uneasiness about having a neighbor willing to launch WMD's against another of its neighbors be enough to pressure them to back down?

Jomini is using Henry Schlottman's [estimates](https://twitter.com/HN_Schlottman/status/1520828540584964096), which are partially based on public US intel releases for the Russian forces and entirely on UA press releases for the Ukrainian ones. 

Importantly, it is believed that US intel is only releasing the total number of ""paper"" BTGs, not their effective combat strength. Many of these BTGs were already at partial strength even before the invasion, and they've been even further reduced now (US intel assuredly has more accurate numbers, but they choose not to release them). Schlottman uses some OPSINT to try and rectify this a bit, but [admits](https://twitter.com/HN_Schlottman/status/1521529499296350209?cxt=HHwWgoCyjZXBx50qAAAA) in a latter post some of these BTGs may be significantly understrength.

The estimates for the UA are even fuzzier. For OPSEC reasons both Jomni and Schlottman refuse to use OSINT to locate UA forces, which means Ukrainian force estimates are based entirely counting up which units the UA happened to have mentioned in a press release recently. What's more, the UA is based on brigades not BTGs so this isn't an apples to apples comparison (Schlottman [estimates](https://twitter.com/HN_Schlottman/status/1521534418208403460) each UA brigade is equal to 2-3 BTGs). Then he chops of 25% of each UA brigade as casualties based on nothing but a wild guess.

And of course, this isn't even taking into account how many reinforcements each side might bring in. God help us if we try to estimate the effect of a Ukrainian counterattack.

[],False,,MagicianNew3838,,,[],,,,text,t2_3rh4cbrh,False,False,"&gt;Britain has four brigades, only two of them armored.

Per the IISS, the British have 11x brigades: 

\-3x armored infantry bde with each: 1x armd recce regt, 1x tk regt, 2x armd inf bn, 1x mech inf bn  
\-2x infantry bde with each: 1x recce regt, 1x lt mech inf bn, 1x lt inf bn  
\-1x infantry bde with: 1x recce regt, 3x lt inf bn  
\-2x infantry bde with each: 2x lt inf bn

\-1x marine bde with: 2x mne bn, 1x amph gp, 1x amph aslt sqn

The British have a further 3x inf bn and 2x amph sqn outside of their brigade structure, as well as another 3x recce regt, 1x armd regt, 15x lt inf bn and 1x para bn with the Army Reserve. In total, the U.K. has thus 42x battalion-sized units in the active force and another 20x in the reserves, for a combined total of **62x battalion-sized maneuver formations**.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

&gt;Compare that to France with 6 division sized brigades, why on earth is Britain ranked higher?

I'm confused - I ranked France 10th and Britain 11th, i.e. France first.

Again per the IISS, the French have 6x brigades:

\-2x armored bde with each: 2x tk regt, 3x armd inf regt  
\-1x light armored bde with: 2x armd cav regt, 1x armd inf regt, 2x mech inf regt  
\-1x mountain bde with: 1x armd cav regt, 3x mtn inf regt  
\-1x airborne bde with: 1x armd cav regt, 4x para regt  
\-1x amphibious bde with: 2x armd cav regt, 1x armd inf regt, 2x mech inf regt

The French have a further 1x recce regt, 3x inf regt and 1x AB regt outside of their brigade structure, as well as a further 1x armd cav regt and 1x mech inf regt in their half of the Franco-German Brigade. They have some army reservists, but unlike the British these aren't incorporated in separate maneuver battalions but rather in 79 company-sized formations. Thus, in total France has 36x battalion-sized units in the active force and, assuming 3x companies = 1x battalion, a combined total of **62x battalion-sized maneuver formations**.

In other words, the British and French ground forces have virtually the same number of maneuver formations, which is unsurprising given that, with their reservists, they number respectively 146,250 and 141,800 personnel.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

&gt;Germany has as many brigades as France, but those are about half strength when comoared to the French brugades.

Still using the IISS, the Germans have 7x brigades:

\-1x armored bde with: 1x armd recce bn, 1x tk bn, 2x armd inf bn, 1x mech inf bn  
\-1x armored bde with: 1x armd recce bn, 1x tk bn, 1x armd inf bn, 1x mech inf bn  
\-1x armored bde with: 1x armd recce bn, 1x tk bn, 2x armd inf bn  
\-1x mechanized infantry bde with: 1x armd recce bn, 2x armd inf bn, 1x mech inf bn  
\-1x mechanized infantry bde with: 1x armd recce bn, 2x tk bn, 2x armd inf bn  
\-1x mountain infantry bde with: 1x recce bn, 3x mtn inf bn  
\-1x airborne brigade with: 2x recce coy, 2x para regt

The Germans have a further 1x separate mne bn, 1x tk bn with the Dutch 43rd Brigade and 2x mech inf bn with the Franco-German Brigade. They have a very small Army Reserve (6,850 personnel) with no maneuver formations. Thus, and assuming para regt have 3x bn each, they have in both their active and reserve forces a total of **36x battalion-sized maneuver formations**.

I feel too many people over-index on the strategic nuclear weapons (the kind that hits major population and industrial centers)... which are indeed extremely unlikely to be used, because ... well... once you fire one the whole modern civilization is basically gone.  


However Russia has access to tactical nukes as well, and those do have enormous value for this conflict. Russia has been increasingly going after infrastructure and logistics, especially in the Western part of Ukraine, in part to interdict weapon and supply shipments coming from NATO. So far they have had limited success because there is only so much conventional ammunition can do to a rail depot or a major highway, that can't be repaired within hours.  


Tactical nukes however? Few 10kt warheads on key intersections and railway stations? Suddenly those weapon supplies are no longer possible, and good luck repairing a railway with all the radiation going on. These strikes wouldn't win the war by themselves, and they are risky in terms of the escalation potential, but they are not entirely unthinkable either... especially if the current ""offensive"" stalls and Putin decides the Western aid is the chief cause.",85ee4827c3ea2020ef5fda855198b40727b349ab,True,False,,,,,0,1651632686,,0,{},i78tzve,False,t3_uheh2u,False,True,t1_i762wvo,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uheh2u/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_03_2022/i78tzve/,1651632699,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651603886.0,

I know this may sound counterintuitive, but small objects are more likely to survive large destruction events than large objects. If I dropped my television from two meters above the ground, with the screen facing the ground, it would shatter on impact. If I dropped a small plastic comb, my keys, or my wallet, nothing would happen to them.

On September 11, Atta's passport survived the initial explosion, then fell several hundred meters, and survived the subsequent collapse of the towers. This is actually believable, and not as far-fetched as one may think. If Atta had his passport on him at the moment of impact, as is likely, the sudden deceleration of the plane pushed Atta's body forward at several hundred miles per hour, which would kill him instantly, either because the belt he wore would crush him, or because the cockpit's environment disintegrating around him in a split second would crush and cut him in pieces. Passports are both light and made of durable materials. They're not made of ordinary paper that would be easily destroyed. In the ensuing chaos that surrounded the fate of Atta's body and the passport he probably had inside his pocket, the force of the impact accelerated the passport forward, outside the tower, where it started falling. A small and light object like a passport would quickly reach its terminal velocity, which would not be that high, and land on a car. The fireball may not have had the time to reach the passport. The plane's fuel tanks are located in the center, the wings, and the tail. In the 1-2 seconds immediately following the impact, it is very believable that the passport ""exited"" the cockpit before the fireball could reach it.",207b451ec51859d6ba330126468e2896e2aec88b,True,False,,,,,0,1651630108,,0,{},i78obpf,False,t3_ud4an5,False,True,t1_i6jmgzo,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ud4an5/an_eyeopening_portrait_of_bin_laden_drawn_from/i78obpf/,1651630123,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651601308.0,

The following list is not comprehensive, and you should do your own research and seek out real experts if possible.

In the United States, Georgetown University's Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service (SFS) is highly regarded. It offers a Master of Science in Foreign Service, a Master of Arts in Security Studies, and other degrees.

In the world of defense, in the U.S., military officers attend a service academy (USMA, USNA, USAFA), a ROTC program, or OCS (Officer Candidate School) prior to be commissioned. Some military officers receive further training at institutions such as the Naval Postgraduate School, the Joint Forces Staff College, the Army Command and General Staff College, the Army War College, the National Defense University, the Naval War College, the School of Advanced Military Studies, the Air Command and Staff College, the Air University, and the Air War College.

Yale University's Brady-Johnson Program in Grand Strategy is also highly regarded, although it's known to be a very selective program, with far more applicants than available spots. You need to be enrolled at Yale in order to apply.

The Middleburry Institute of International Studies at Monterey offers a Master of Arts in Nonproliferation and Terrorism Studies. The only reason I know about this program is because Jeffrey Lewis is constantly quoted in the media on issues related to weapons of mass destruction, and he is a research director there.

The world of intelligence is vast. I know of someone who studied mathematics at Princeton University and interned at the National Security Agency during the summers. People with language skills in languages of interest to the intelligence community - Mandarin chinese, Russian, Arabic (modern standard, Egyptian, Iraqi, Levantine), Pashto, Persian Farsi, and Tagalog are in need.

You can take a look at the CIA's careers portal to see what they're looking for: https://www.cia.gov/careers/

They have an opening for operations staff officers for example. Here are the educational requirements:

""Bachelor‚Äôs degree from an accredited institution (applicants within one year of earning a four year degree will be considered); there is no preferred major or program of study (degrees from foreign academic institutions are accepted, but you are responsible for obtaining and providing CIA with a credential evaluation from an accredited firm confirming that the foreign degree is the equivalent of a BA/BS and/or MA/MS degree conferred by a U.S. college or university)""

Yes, brutal and savage invasions involving massacres, looting, and widespread destruction have a tendency to unify a population. 

To be clear, my point is not that Zelensky should seek a peaceful settlement at this time. The correlation of forces seem to favour Ukraine (a trend that is increasing every day with the widespread flow of weapons into the country) and time appears to be on the side of Ukraine. Even if Russia were to mobilize, it's apparent that Ukraine could inflict significant damages on the mauled Russian Army currently in Ukraine.

My point is simply that I wouldn't expect Zelensky to say anything else at the current moment. *Very* few wars (none I can think of) begin with either side rapidly offering concessions, especially in the absence of a full-scale military breakdown (and no, the Russian Army has not experienced this yet). We have reached a phase wherein Zelensky and Putin are both constrained by domestic politics and thus will continue the fighting until the battlefield offers the conditions for a political settlement (indeed, Zelensky has already stated that he wants to solve the status of Crimea diplomatically).",1527238182f67f6830988acb5a60c3cb1370bd2e,True,False,,,,,0,1651626660,,0,{},i78gh8o,False,t3_uheh2u,False,True,t1_i78bz3k,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uheh2u/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_03_2022/i78gh8o/,1651626677,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651597860.0,

Choice quotes:  


""What those decisions are remains a mystery to U.S. intelligence. But one of the U.S. senior intelligence officials tells Newsweek that there is speculation that the purpose of General Valery Gerasimov's trip to Ukraine was two-fold: to check on‚Äîand get a candid view of‚Äîthe progress of the war, and to convey highly sensitive information to Russian generals there about what the future could hold, should the Russian position in southern Ukraine become even more dire.  


""It's not exactly something that you say over the phone,"" the senior official says. ""At this point, no one thinks that nuclear escalation will occur on the battlefield or originate in Ukraine. But if nuclear escalation occurs, they need to know what measures are expected from them during the shock period that the use of a WMD \[weapon of mass destruction\] would provoke. Do they attack? Do they hunker down and prepare for retaliation? Do they withdraw to Russia to defend the state?""""  


""A demonstration attack is definitely part of Russia's repertoire,"" a senior U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) planner who is an expert on Russian forces tells Newsweek. ""Does it make sense? Would it achieve its objective? Is it a war crime? Don't look at it through our lens. Think about it from Putin's. Back against the wall, no prospects of salvaging the war, the bite of economic sanctions. Shock might be what he needs to survive.

Bigotry against Slavs and the desire for ""living space"" based on the conquest and genocide of Eastern Europe were important to the plans and dogma of Nazi officials, but the latter crystallized more in the 1930's, especially by members of the agricultural ministry who wanted to secure farmland for Germany. Meanwhile anti-semitism was foundational to the founding myths of the Nazi Party. Jews represented the imagined enemies of the Nazis from Western Bankers, to Russian Bolsheviks, to Leftists who had supposedly ""stabbed Germany in the Back"".  The racist hierarchy was later codified, but anti-semitism is the main original glue holding the NDSAP together. Western historians also don't doubt the Nazis genocidal intent or practice to both Slavs and Jews before and during the war, but note how the Germans, on the whole, singled the Jews out for complete destruction after 1942.
