[],False,,WilliamWyattD,,,[],,,,text,t2_awhnx2o,False,False,"While I keep an open mind, I do tend to believe in the universality of some form of liberal democracy as the best current solution devised to rather universal problems of governance. However, the conditions that obtain when liberal democracy is the best solution take time to emerge. The liberal international order does need to be more sensitive to the fact that many nations are not yet ready for liberal democracy, and work on developing bridging ideas of governance that take into account local conditions, including cultural cohesion and levels of economic development.

I do not like Leninism because it aims at never becoming a liberal democracy. It's advanced social control organizational technology is also too intrusive, and beyond what is needed. I think it does matter whether an authoritarian regime is considered temporary and transitory until certain conditions are met, or whether it is considered a permanent and ideal state of affairs. I do understand that, whatever the rhetoric, the change to something more democratic will still be difficult when the time comes. But I think the rhetoric matters.

One caveat, to all of this, is that it may possibly true that some states have borders that make them so artificial that liberal democracy may never work, or not for the foreseeable future until some truly transformative levels of cultural change have taken place. Liberal democracy, while designed specifically to deal with situations where there can be no agreement on many of the most basic questions of how to live, does also seem to require at least some degree of overall consensus with respect to tolerance. It is unclear that deeply fractured polities where there is a true passion for one set of answers to basic questions over the other, and true hatred for other ethnic or religious groups, can become successful democracies while such conditions obtain.",4d432facb69e129336f36623de6199a980d15b1c,True,False,,,,,0,1648234836,,0,{},i23n6rd,False,t3_tnns9w,False,True,t3_tnns9w,/r/geopolitics/comments/tnns9w/why_democracy_stalled_in_the_middle_east_economic/i23n6rd/,1648234854,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648206036.0,

That's already allowed for under international customary law. While Article 51 generally prohibits use of force, historically it's been allowed to protect a state's overseas citizens. The US has done this as have France and other major powers. 

I advise you to consult Michael Wood's ""INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE USE OF FORCE: WHATHAPPENS IN PRACTICE?"" as he's more experienced in PIL than I. 

&gt;There is also provision for China to ""make ship visits, to carry out logistical replenishment in, and have stopover and transition in Solomon Islands"".

""A naval base, navy base, or military port is a military base, where warships and naval ships are docked when they have no mission at sea or need to restock. Ships may also undergo repairs. Some naval bases are temporary homes to aircraft that usually stay on ships but are undergoing maintenance while the ship is in port.""

Simply having access to a port does not mean the Chinese have a base in the Soloman Islands. Navies of other countries frequently do stopovers at ports but that doesn't mean they have a base. For example, the US used to stop over in HK quite regularly. However, that stop over does not mean the US Navy had a HK naval base. There is a very large difference between a stopover at HK and their Okinawa base (which is actually a base)

&gt;but it's still just you being naive about Chinese motives. 

Chinese actions that are suspect are suspect for a reason: they're out of the ordinary. However, these actions are hardly the deviation from the international norms other countries have practiced.

&gt;saddle their government with insane levels of debt to build projects 

Their debt is only 6% of GDP,  for comparison Australia's debt was 24% of GDP in 2020. Hardly an insane amount of debt. Indeed, the mine project you're probably talking about doesn't require Soloman Islands to pay at all.

You're correct on Chinese companies but inaccurate about Chinese workers.

Yes, but not if it interferes with interstate commerce... so basically, they *can* until the Federal government sues, makes a legal argument based on the Interstate Commerce Clause, and wins (which it generally will).

Functionally, that means that it's very challenging for a state to make (and keep) the import or export of any particular good illegal if it is legal at a federal level, but very easy for a state to make (and keep) the import or export of any particular good legal from the perspective of the state authorities, even if it is illegal at the federal level.

Nah, I rather disagree. Classically, the US has three core geopolitical interests. One: Maintain hegemony in North America, the Greater Caribbean, and South America. Two: Maintain naval supremacy on the whole of the World Ocean. Three: Prevent any single power on the World Island from achieving hegemony there.

If any single power rose to the status of hegemon in the East, truly secure from land threats, just as we are in the West - that power could threaten US naval supremacy, which would, over the course of generations, grant them the power to ally with a Western Hemisphere country, and then threaten the US by land.

A multipolar world, therefore, is not as good as a unipolar world from a US perspective; but it is much better than a bipolar world.

1) From an economics perspective, I definitely agree that the core reason the authoritarian middle eastern states probably performed better was because of stability.

Politicians love to pretend as if all the wonders and development that occurs in a country are a result of their management and actions, but again from an economics perspective in actuality most of the progress is actually a result of hard working talented people being given a stable environment to work hard together and being allowed to actually develop society without government getting in the way.

Education, stable markets and developments in science and technology are behind longer term progress far more than governmental actions on average, and most societies will progress regardless of governmental system if you don't block one of these underlying drivers (its most important from historical evidence that you want to get rid of any government that does block these quick).

2) “Our country should abolish elections and have experts govern.” 

From a more scientific perspective, I don't see why the two have to be so mutually exclusive. Maybe a system that has some degree of electoral power, but also one designed to make it so experts are selected - not strong man masters of propaganda; say by requiring the elected to have a hard science degree.

It shouldn't be about the US model vs China model, governmental systems should be adaptable, and you should pick what works from the data available and try and create something that suits your situation as naturally, there are a lot of differences between US/China and middle eastern nations.

even accepting the measurements of the indexes mentioned rising for Muslims in India, they've gone up quicker and more substantially in china. the point was that if the west uses china's discrimination as a fault to undermine it, India is in a worse position. what-about-isms about discrimination in the west can be done but the hegemon gets to dictate the rules for everyone else, it's never fair. either way, all my points were already conceded. for future reference don't tie personal worth to nation states, think of structures of power as needing to be criticized in order to be improved. ironically this is what lets them last.",b2afc98d0c8bf94fbdead6c59e6eec4cf7bef170,True,False,,,,,0,1648220453,,0,{},i22mfc2,False,t3_tnhsda,False,True,t1_i22elq1,/r/geopolitics/comments/tnhsda/indias_response_to_the_ukraine_crisis_is_a_wakeup/i22mfc2/,1648220484,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648191653.0,

""To understand why the Arab world’s ardor for democracy has faded, it is crucial to grasp that most of the people who took to the streets in 2011 were motivated not just by a desire for liberty but also by intense frustration with the material conditions of their lives. “Bread, freedom, and justice” was the protest slogan often heard in Cairo during the Egyptian uprising—and there is a reason bread comes first on the list. Egyptians and Tunisians saw economic considerations as the primary reason for the Arab Spring revolts in their countries, according to Arab Barometer surveys conducted in both places in 2011. The protesters were tired of political repression, but they were deeply angry about the meager opportunities that authoritarian systems afforded. The brief flowering of pro-democracy passions and movements failed to produce durable democratic governments. Perhaps more important, however, it also failed to produce the kind of economic change that people across the Middle East desperately craved.  
Today, the region is plagued by the same issues that have dragged down its economic development for decades: high unemployment, especially among young people; low rates of participation in the labor force, especially among women; a lack of high-quality education; rising inequality; and rampant corruption.""",a92b8b84803642381bea564a2fec8661869e8006,True,False,,,,,0,1648220434,,0,{},i22mdmr,True,t3_tnns9w,False,True,t3_tnns9w,/r/geopolitics/comments/tnns9w/why_democracy_stalled_in_the_middle_east_economic/i22mdmr/,1648220450,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648191634.0,

This line is enough to stop reading this article.

1. Public opinion barely creeps into foreign policy decision making. The article oversells relation between public opinion and foreign policy.
2. This is simply false statement. The anti-US/West sentiments is largely an internet thing and blossomed in the last few years. There is a rise in bigoted nationalist Indians (and other nationalities) in the internet. You can see the same in YouTube comments/Twitter aswell. But you look at any surveys or opinion polls and you get a totally different picture.

In the internet, I had personally been subjected to racist/bigoted comments from people claiming to be Americans. But meeting American tourists and I have totally different opinion about them.

This is just a sensationalist article meant for internet consumption. If you want to know why India voted neutral, you can study the deep Russian military dependence especially for maintenance reasons where India will need Russian engineers. 

India has made a choice to tilt towards west few years ago and it will materialize over time whether internet Indians like it or not.

i still think the leverage pakistan has via nukes in the middle east is a bigger problem than people realize. maybe not purely strategically but because of the outsized influence of the Israeli lobby on American politics. the Saudis have already backed away from from Israel. they would undermine legitimacy too much in the Muslim world. i can see a potential trump future where the good relationship with Israel is leveraged to allow it to get nukes. which i assume would come from Pakistan since the Saudis did bankroll Pakistan through the sanctions. unless Israel plans to do a tech transfer for nukes it claims not to have. 

 Israel has been claiming Iran is close to nuclear armament for about twenty years now. i saw a viral twitter post that had 20 years of American headlines from Israeli intelligence saying the program is near completion, i doubt that at this point. i will say I'm not familiar with the Pakistan Iran dynamic and why it's amicable either. perhaps they don't want to get pincered in a two/three front hostility. the religious elements does already resemble a powder keg.

The fact is, we never had the cards. We were a socialist economy, and USA since our independence has been an ally of our hostile neighbour. It actively supported Pakistan, supplied arms and money, and sanctioned India for its nuclear tests, and then ISRO. In the meantime it sent a task force in Bay of Bengal in 1971.

You are damn scared aren't you? Your two comments makes it appear as if India is some devil. 

The fact is, we never had the cards. We were a socialist economy, and USA since our independence has been an ally of our hostile neighbour. It actively supported Pakistan, supplied arms and money, and sanctioned India for its nuclear tests, and then ISRO. In the meantime it sent a task force in Bay of Bengal in 1971. USA also sabotaged our nuclear programme, and then didn't agree to give us a supercomputer when we asked for it.

- Pakistan has been supported diplomatically by the US for decades and Pakistani military primarily uses US hardware(f-16s and M4s). Things have changed recently and Pakistan is closer to China now but Indians cannot forget the massive US support it has enjoyed for decades.
- It is a general perception in US politics that India should be a partner because China is the biggest threat to US hegemony and so India should side with US to contain China. India has frosty relations with China but India has maintained an independent foreign policy for decades and India wants to continue this way.
- US sent a carrier strike group in the Bay of Bengal to help Pakistan during the 1971 war.
- India was sanctioned heavily after the Pokharan nuclear tests by the US and that memory is still fresh in the minds of Indians.
- US is a super power, economically and militarily but India is the world’s largest democracy and the most populous nation. Indians want to be treated as a partner and not as nation taking orders from a super power.

Right now India is the heavyweight. It's not only undermining US sanctions but also the US dollar by doing so while abstaining from any condemnation against Russia at the United Nations.  

This is India. This is how India will be 10 years from now. I think the Americans have the real power as like with China, India must have the US in order for it to rise whereas US can easily find cheap labour as it's been doing in Vietnam. Vietnam has been very nice to the US and in return, US is flooding them with more and more opportunities. Vietnam will become a rich nation because of this and the great part for the US is a small country has huge impact with diversity.

People forget a golden rule: The buyer, the one with the money in the very end holds the cards. Kinda like how billionaires get away with so much, the same can be said at a nation to nation level. It's been going on for thousands of years. With globolisation, it's easier than ever to diversify over time. 

In Europe we are doing this with LNG now. In our lifetimes, the EU will never depend on Russian oil/gas as much as many countries have been. Those days are over. While it seems like India holds all of the cards, it absolutely isn't even close, in fact the US has been very slow to open up all  of these factories in India because Indian made products are so unreliable whereas China, Vietnam you have very low prices coupled with high reliability. US companies can literally go country to country, see which countries take it very serious and which dont, going from there while the US considers free trade deals or not, perhaps high tariffs for those that play games.

It is entirely possible (and in my opinion, common) for an immigrant to enjoy a Western lifestyle and at the same time retain a world view that aligns with their non-Western home country. Hence immigration tendencies can be taken at most as a measure of confidence in economy, and not of alignment of values.",c41c73413c9bc83916cc52bdf924437ef39bc6bf,True,False,,,,,0,1648207459,,0,{},i21vp4f,False,t3_tnhsda,False,True,t1_i21lwu2,/r/geopolitics/comments/tnhsda/indias_response_to_the_ukraine_crisis_is_a_wakeup/i21vp4f/,1648207470,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648178659.0,

India abstaining vote on US resolution at UN is big news, but India abstaining on Russian resolution at UN isn't.

This feels highly hypocritical. More than hypocrisy, it appears as though the west is finding excuses to not help India in case of a similar situation in Indo-Pacific. A mood is being created where India is anti-west.

Critical remarks on Russia are welcome, but critical remarks on the west's geopolitical decisions leading to this War is deemed as anti-west.

This feels like preaching, and not partnering with India. The preaching sets of a wrong note. The entirety of western civilization is still viewed by majority through the lense of imperialistic colonial oppressors. Just like holocaust is fresh in West's memories, the colonial tragedies are fresh in Indian minds. 

Moreover not to forget that my parents generations have been through the era where US sanctioned India for fighting a rightful battle for Bangladesh's independence. Half of the country's population has been through it.

This and the historic precedence of US abandoning allies which are not bound by treaty is what raises red flags for Indians. Wherever US visits, conflict escalates, doesn't de-escalate.

Just recently US evacuated Afghanistan without any discussion with its partners in the region. Afghanistan has a direct security impact on India. US weapons are now being captured from killed terrorists trying to infiltrate Indian border.

And not to mention the anti-india comments you get to read on YouTube, Reddit or any other channels. India has one of the largest internet user population. Everytime India abstains from a UN vote(which is meaningless and practically does nothing to resolve the situation), there are calls in the chats and comments to come down hard on India and sanctions them. There are calls to stop giving aid to India. As OP mentioned in a chat above, 'Hate begets Hate'. Indians respond equivocally.

What west also needs to understand that at the end of the day this is a cold war, and India doesn't want to participate in it. India led the Non Aligned Movement in last cold war, and would do the same again. Taking sides in the war is going to increase the polarization in the world and is in no one's interest.

Tusk was shocked and thought it was a dubious joke.

Domestic politics shapes foreign policy, and Indian public seems to use a lens of realism to judge Westerns calls and actions, that lead to accusations of hypocrisy and prejudice. If America wants to nurture India as a security and strategic partner, it is important for them to build a positive public opinion towards them, not just assume the existence or inevitability of it. It can be done by unequivocally backing India in the areas of its core strategic interests.


Interesting Quotes:

&gt; However, amid political debates about India’s awkward support of Russia and its impact on India-U.S. ties, a dimension of public opinion needs to be reckoned with. Submerged behind the policy elites and commentators’ refined justification of India’s stand on Ukraine as being driven by national interest is the raw national attitude alluding to India’s past disillusionment with the West. India’s stance on the Ukraine war reflects the tremendous domestic public support that Russia enjoys compared to the United States, a reality that Washington has seemingly yet to grasp. The public evocation of collective memory, connecting India’s past disenchantment with the U.S to the present, is glaringly evident in discussions on social media.
&gt; ...
&gt; Therefore, to be effective, the United States should concentrate on publicly demonstrating what it can offer to address India’s concerns. Reasonably, support to India’s most pressing international causes and apprehensions can persuade the nationalist audience in the country. Unequivocal U.S. support to India vis-à-vis Pakistan is imperative. In addition, the United States could also make extra efforts to expand defense cooperation and enhance India’s military capabilities, for which New Delhi is chiefly reliant on Russia at the moment. The bottom line is that both parties must be ready to build shared interests through strategic compromises and prioritizing. As an immediate measure in this regard, the United States must refrain from sanctioning India under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) for New Delhi’s purchase of S-400 systems from Russia.",0b49eb8bd8cc5b9fb01ddb20b6b25c75293a360f,True,False,,,,,0,1648199119,,0,{},i21kx34,True,t3_tnhsda,False,True,t3_tnhsda,/r/geopolitics/comments/tnhsda/indias_response_to_the_ukraine_crisis_is_a_wakeup/i21kx34/,1648199135,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648170319.0,

I'm not suggesting this would happen overnight, why are you ignoring my usage of the term 'long run' - words like these have inherent assumptions and associations involved. 

You are acting as if statistics and concepts like trend lines don't exist. I'm speaking in terms of probability distributions. Edge cases naturally exist in the short run, hence you can come up with as many edge case counter points as you want (these are things for academics to worry over), but for the average person all they should understand is that in the long run, probability distributions act how you'd expect them too - truly good things naturally spread, if they don't, they just aren't 'truly good', and might just be 'decent'.

IF your implementation of a system was as effective as you think it was, it will naturally spread automatically in the long run, because people aren't blind, dumb and selfish as you think they are when shown concrete evidence that a implementation is truly great and a drastic improvement.

&gt;If your claims were true, humanity would have settled on one form of government long ago.

My point was literally the opposite of that. The current **implementation** of democracy isn't good enough to warrant it to spread as much as the author of the OP believes it should and will - she was one of those that held it to be just that 'one form of government' that humanity would have settled on.

My point was, if she wants it to actually spread, instead of typing words, she should consider fixing her own home grown democracy which is clearly on the decline fast before trying to force it on others.

Maybe after several iterations of improving the 'implementation', it could become that one form of governance. Right now, it's far from it.

Ok so we do have room for agreeing. I also agree China is expanding militarily but I think the success of that expansion and whether they want to take the preeminent spot of military power is questionable. 

&gt;Have you missed out on the past decade of US-China relations?

I think the mistake is examining only the past decade. This relationship between China and the US is likely to go up and down, that's just how these things work due to political changes in China and the US.

&gt;given in different interests, ideals. Part of the reason why they cooperated so well for decades is because A. They decided to kick the hard differences down the road until they finally couldn’t

I disagree with this, plenty of ppl in the CCP were actually willing to reform but that branch was crushed by the more red wing that Xi has joined. Many of the antagonistic actions we've seen China do (that they've rightfully been criticized for) is because of Xi but he's not permanent. The CCP is more than him and given how they're a necessary evil at this point, it's likely a reformist leader would lead to different relations. Or a different US leader could lead to different relations (Obama for example worked with Xi to get a cyber security treaty that actually worked until Trump basically ripped it up).

My point is that there's so many variables to this relationship that are constantly in flux that one cannot simply predict that in the next 10 years, the US and China will still be antagonists to each other.

&gt;China would liberalize through engagement, trade and development

To an extent they have. Compared to 1971, they've liberalized significantly. Xo has rolled some of it back but the answer isn't less engagement.

&gt;But you literally just proved what I said about overseas interests and a need to project power.

There is no need for them to project power is what I'm saying tho. Because if their motivation for military power to protect economic interests, the US fills that well as well (just look at Djibouti and how much more the US has been doing than China to combat piracy).

Globalization means that US and China multinationals are working together in the same places meaning that American military protecting economics interests also benefits China.

The existence of a singular military base overseas can hardly be used as a proof of a need to project power.",a07bfd5005015b4a9fdc332e3fe6b5b17c0d35ff,True,False,,,,,0,1648184949,,0,{},i21381e,False,t3_tnd1w5,False,True,t1_i2123w0,/r/geopolitics/comments/tnd1w5/china_and_solomon_islands_draft_secret_security/i21381e/,1648184966,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648156149.0,

I don't think you can definitively say that you need a strong economy before democracy. Developing a country does not demand or exclude any type of government. Any effective leader will do, whether they be an elected president or a dictator. The real necessity for development is effective policy-making and strong rule of law which is not tied to any system of governance. Autocracy can be very effective at organizing an economy because there are no barriers to implementing policy. However, this is both a strength and a curse. Even a good autocrat can make painful mistakes they will loathe to admit and reverse, while a bad autocrat can completely destroy a country. When you have a system that is only accountable to itself, it is more prone to lie and distort reality to sustain itself rather than admit flaws. That is the essence of how absolute power leads to corruption. 

No democracy is perfect or has perfect human rights, but only a government that is accountable to the people can protect human rights. Democracy is also fragile and can be corrupted without a strong tradition and well educated population as you say.

I would suggest that you wait until the war is over and the fog of war clears up before assuming that this perception of the Russian military is actually grounded in reality and not just western/Ukrainian propaganda.

&gt;Russia outnumbers the enemy 10 to 1

The ratio is more like 5:1 in terms of active personnel (1,014,000 to 220,000), but it should be remembered that only a fifth or so of Russia's active presonnel is participating in the Ukraine invasion and Ukraine has probably mobilized most if not all of its reserve personnel, which would double its numbers and put the real ratio at 2:1, if not better, in Ukraine's favor, and that's before accounting for Ukraine's mass conscription efforts.

The idea that Russia failed because it didn't conquer Ukraine in 2 weeks is absurd.

Human society does not always progress, and there are examples of it regressing at large scales for centuries at a time.

If your claims were true, humanity would have settled on one form of government long ago. Pick your favorite well-run democracy. Let's take Norway, a perennial candidate for most democratic country based on the Democracy Index. While the Democracy Index is less than two decades old, Norway's traditions go back much further. Yet we don't see, for example, the DRC or Venezuela rushing to adopt a Norway-style democracy. Why not?

Because putting food on the table and keeping your children safe outweighs the right to vote in free and fair elections. Because having your group keep power is more important than knowing that the person running things was fairly elected. Because change can be terrifying and letting go of old traditions that provide the perception of stability results in a perceived devaluing of one's culture, which leads to perceived devaluing of one's self.

Democracy requires work and risk to establish and continue. We look at democratic countries and celebrate their democratic traditions but often forget what it took to actually get there. In many cases, there were repression, oppression, civil uprisings, bloody wars, and enormous social upheaval. These are still going on in many countries today, and few of them are likely to come out with stable, let alone strong, democracies.

Look at Tunisia. It kicked off the Arab Spring and resulted in a dramatic shift away from authoritarianism, one of the most remarkable on record, but it has struggled to maintain its democracy. There's no guarantee that a decade from now it will still be one. Many African countries have struggled with maintaining democracies since they gained independence starting in the 1960s. If your view were correct, at least a few of them would have achieved notable stability in the past 60 years. Instead, Mauritius is the only one that holds a status of Full Democracy, while Botswana, Cape Verde, Ghana, Lesotho, Namibia, and South Africa are listed as Flawed Democracies, and you can't tell me that all of those are stable states.

And speaking of South Africa, let's go back a while to the Apartheid Era. The Black population vastly outnumbered the White population for the entirety of Apartheid, and yet the system survived for decades. Blacks knew perfectly well that they were oppressed and that there were better, fairer systems elsewhere in the world. Had they managed to band together and rush the White government, they could have taken power quickly. But for most of them, basic survival won out over going for their rights. It was more important for most of them to ensure that their children got safely to bed each night than it was to fight for their right to vote. It wasn't until even the US, which had used South Africa as a bulwark against the spread of communism in the very southern parts of Africa, stopped supporting the government (partially due to pressure on the US from yet other governments) that apartheid finally came down because the governments of Botha and de Klerk finally--and slowly--relented.

And that is how most people in the world live: day to day, trying to stay alive and see their kids grow up. If they can do that without a vote, most will. Maybe not happily, but happiness isn't a core component of survival.",0773192c76638807c77068ca674d6cde881214f6,True,False,,,,,0,1648174923,,0,{},i20k5un,False,t3_tl8wiz,False,True,t1_i1yi21f,/r/geopolitics/comments/tl8wiz/madeleine_k_albright_the_coming_democratic_revival/i20k5un/,1648174935,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648146123.0,

Same could be said about Japan, France or Korea. The democratic US still disenfranchises blacks today. What makes a non-western person different enough to be incapable or incompatible with democracy? It's also not like the West decided to become democratic overnight, it was a centuries long progress that was paid by blood and is still ongoing. 

All the coups in latin america, middle east and africa that were either directly or tacitly supported by US led to bloodshed. But there were nothing democratic about these actions. If anything the west doesn't believe in the superiority of their ideology enough to take the long term view and does too much direct intervention out of fear to get short term results. Trying to force a system to another country is foolish (though there are successful examples as well). 

We are also seeing a lot of countries becoming more democratic however slow it might be.

This is a random aside, and it's also a good soundbite but not a good way of describing the overarching conflict.

&gt; the undeniable apartheid.

It's absolutely ""deniable"", and very clearly not an accurate description. The inaccuracies and evidence of severe deficiencies and bias in the Amnesty and HRW reports demonstrate as much. They got basic, basic facts wrong repeatedly. It's also hard to argue that apartheid exists in a state where Arabs literally are in the governing coalition, saying there is no apartheid. That doesn't mean there's no *racism*, which exists in *every state*, but that's not the same thing as apartheid.

&gt;Having said that, from where I stand as a Kosovar Albanian, there is some hypocrisy in the article. He conveniently ignores the political aspect of their situation in the article and focuses solely on directly comparing the treatment of Ukraine and the treatment of Palestine, underlining how different the reaction of the West (US and EU) was/is in that respect. He does this by completely ignoring the political context. Considering the official stance of Palestine towards Kosovo, I am a bit taken aback. During the time when the Serbian regime (at that time) was committing genocide against my people, Palestinians were officially/politically on Serbia's side and, more or less, ignored what was happening in Kosovo. I understand that because of the Israel-Palestine situation they couldn't recognize Kosovo because that would be politically hypocritical, and they might have even condemned the violence, but they were clearly on Serbia's side. In what way is that different from the US and EU attitude towards them now?

Now you understand to some extent how Kuwaitis feel about Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the Palestinian support for it.

There's also no comparison. The Palestinian goal is not independence from Israel, it is the destruction of Israel. That's the distinction between Kosovo, or Ukraine, or Kurdistan, and Palestinians. It is Israel that sought independence from the Arab-run Middle East, and a tiny sliver of land for themselves to rule. Even that is consistently attacked by the 20+ Arab states as too much, and Palestinians have repeatedly said they are not content with part of that land and with being a majority in Jordan too; they want all of Israel, as well.

That's why Ukraine compares itself to Israel, not Palestinians, just as Kurds feel a strong connection to Israel. Groups with a long history of being downtrodden sympathize with Israel trying to preserve independence and the ability to stand upright against much larger enemies around them. It's only in recent years that what used to be Soviet propaganda has found a new home in the far-left and far-right, painting Israel as the big bad actor in a war Palestinian leaders openly admitted they began.",b4d16b9de0ea379eadb4dc950a01f9cc1280492a,True,False,,,,,0,1648167272,,0,{},i2036ax,False,t3_tks1ox,False,True,t1_i1wgbgg,/r/geopolitics/comments/tks1ox/opinion_israels_semineutrality_on_ukraine_cant/i2036ax/,1648167286,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648138472.0,

That is a private land/property dispute that has been in the courts for decades. To consider this some form of expulsion is absurd.

&gt; occasional destruction of Bedouin villages and encampments as proof of ethnic cleansing

Removal of shanty towns built without permits or infrastructure is not unique to Israel nor does it translate to ethnic cleansing.

I don't know if your country allows you to setup tin hut housing wherever you want, but in most places it is not accepted and regularly demolished.

&gt; Israeli policy pf house demolitions

Specifically targets homes of militants who attack Israelis with the aim to compensate the financial benefits granted to their families (pay-to-slay policies) given by the Palestinian Authority.

Again, i'll draw parallels to other countries (and even the UN) which have policies of asset forfeiture for criminals and acts of corruption. Most recent and visible examples are confiscation of property belonging to Russian billionaires (who more often than not have nothing to do with the Ukraine war). 

&gt; the ongoing refugee issue

Millions of refugees have been resettled since ww2 - you don't hear about the 12 million Germans who were booted from Europe or the 14 million Hindu/Muslim refugees from the Indian partition. The Palestinian refugee issue is artificial - most people considered Palestinian refugees are already citizens of other countries, and those who are not have been prevented naturalization by Arab countries.

&gt; numbered at around 5.4 million last I checked.

To give you an example - UNRWA quotes 2.2 million Palestinian refugees in Jordan.. but these are 3rd and sometimes 4th generation Jordanian citizens - they are not refugees in any sense of the word. 

That is half the Palestinian 'refugee problem' gone in one sentence.

&gt; If one considers every single eviction ... as ethnic cleansing

The only people who think this way are those who want to inflame the conflict by misrepresenting the issue.",7a905e0e74fd5eb0ad88dca2309695635849380d,True,False,,,,,0,1648166777,,0,{},i20229g,False,t3_tl4u2d,False,True,t1_i1xenw7,/r/geopolitics/comments/tl4u2d/do_mass_forced_expulsions_and_population/i20229g/,1648166794,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1648137977.0,
