A leadership's first task is maintain its legitimacy against those who hold power. Democracies have inbuild mechanisms here, authoritarian regimes do not. An authoritarian leader can only maintain his legitimacy by constantly winning, be it militarily or through whatever measures those who hold power care about. If an authoritarian leader doesn't keep producing wins for his circle, said circle can remove him, or just sit by as others remove him, at any time.

Further, an authoritarian leader usually doesn't have an off-ramp. Other than democracies, where what the next government is going to do to you is usually capped by public sentiment or limited personal power, getting rid of the guy before you (plus his power structure, including backers and family/clan/ethnis group) is typically advantageous for a new leader.

So an authoritarian leader cannot, under any circumstances, lose in any major decision. It is thus that even when a mistake is realised said mistake will often be continued even at monumental costs for the own nation.

Religion? Ukraine is secular, next. Irredentism is not a trait of the contemporary Ukrainian collective national consciousness, next. And Social Conservatism is ubiquitous and by its very nature, dull, next. Although in a sense I would say all are factors. A point could be made more involved here that a desire for social conservatism, irredentism, and religion is derived from insecurity (maintenance of the status quo, stability, etc.). 

The Russian past is scarred and its people seem to have begun to respect the safety and security provided by a strong dictatorial power. I think any person who would prefer Russia, is analogous with someone who is insecure or at least feels cheated by the world. Insecure people will respect bullies more: power and standing up for yourself; what have you. I believe insecurity is the fundamental emotional message if any, that one could embrace from Russia and act upon in an inspired manner. 

North Korea shows this quite well, foreshadowing Russia. The insecurity of the North Korean people is alleviated by a 'strong' figure in government who is perceived to alleviate the hardship of the world in which they suffer, instead actually only making it worse. A classic example of gaslighting abuse in which the victim does not perceive its own victimhood.

At the end of the day, I think there is not much of a message to push. This war was not conducted with the interest of pushing a rallying ideal. This is Putin's mistrustful and abused personality unearthing. Ofc bogging things down to insecurity isn't particularly useful, analytically.

It specifically talks about the command structure in the PLA Navy and how the Political Commissar in the PLA is not exactly the same as Leninist-style Soviet Political Commissar.

The Chinese Navy has a ""Square"" (Dual Command) command structure, while the US Navy has a ""Triangle"" structure. In the US Navy, the CO, XO, and Senior NCO form a triad in the command structure. In the Chinese Navy, the CO, Political Commissar, XO(s) and Deputy Political Commissar(s) form a ""square"". The CO in the Chinese Navy is \*mostly\* in command, but is ultimately answerable to the Party Committee in charge, which is headed by the Political Commissar.

...

&gt;Sergei Rudskoi from the Russian Armed Forces just released a potentially transformative statement about Russia's objectives in Ukraine.

...

&gt;Rudskoi defined the mission in Ukraine to be the ""liberation of Donbas"" rather than ""demilitarization and denazification"". This aligns with Russia's recent focus on military efforts in eastern Ukraine and suggests that Russia has temporarily shelved its goal of regime change.

...

&gt;Even more intriguingly, Rudskoi appeared to have walked back regime change as an initial goal. Rudskoi said that Russia could have ""liberated Donbas"" via a Donbas-centric operation or a nationwide operation. It chose the latter nationwide course.

Add this to the fact that now Finland and Sweden may join nato and also Russian troops are being pulled from the Kuril Islands, NATOs borders and South Ossetia etc it really shows Putin is tripling down and destroying Russia’s security posture for his own self interested reasons.

If they keep tripling down and they start grinding down their army which constitutes a huge proportion of their deployable force, near 75% putin could be collapsing the Russian military.

The losses are nothing to snort at, they’re totally unsustainable.

Putin has actually greatly damaged Russia not strengthened it and he shows no signs of being able to cut losses. If as soon as the Kyiv offensive failed they dug in and then focused on donbass it wouldn’t be like this. 

At the moment these troops have taken heavy losses and also low on food and some have no fuel. They can’t fight while losing so many men and in dire conditions without having any rest.

If he rotated troops out that will totally stall the offensive as many need rest, likely several days rest.

If he continues without giving some of these most scarred and shell shocked troops rest we could see mass desertions or surrenders or even unrest.


I mean look at the situation in north western Kyiv, they’re facing encirclement.

If they get encircled and there is a mass surrender then the Putin will face such a pants around ankles humiliation that even more than before there is nothing he can do to win.

This is unlikely because they would have been unable to respond to many of the Russian armoured thrusts without the availability of reserves. So, they probably have a reserve of military forces somewhere.

And

&gt;It is one option that the Ukrainian high command is surely investigating. It will want to exploit opportunities such as the large numbers of surrounded Russian soldiers in places such as the Bucha Pocket west of Kyiv. If their adversary has run out of offensive capacity, is at the limit of logistic support, and is vulnerable from the air, there may be a narrow window of opportunity for the Ukrainians to conduct operations to seize back some of their territory.

Lets look at the Bucha Pocket.

I find it highly unlikely that Ukraine will encroach on Russia's borders. So Russia will mostly remain secure with some heavy sanctions in the long run. Something akin to North Korea. A country with a shitty standard of living, but still ""secure"" within their own borders.

With that, how does this conflict end? To me, there are two possible scenarios.

* There is a peace treaty of some sort of compromise between Ukraine and Russia. Even a non-peace peace treaty like the one in Korea is a possibility. 
* Putin loses power, the new power blames Putin, and forges a new path for Russia. In the form of a coup, assassination, or revolution. Keep in mind that there could be a power structure reorganization in Russia that does not end this war. 

Looking at the above, those could happen. I'd give a peace treaty a 50/50 and Putin losing power a 25/75. But that's a WAG, so take that as you see fit. 

But I'd prefer to think of this under a different assumption. That there will be no peace treaty and that Putin will not lose power in Russia. And what does the long term out come of that look like?

Yesterday I used the words ""full mobilization"" in a comment and I think that was a mistake. I think I should use the words ""gradual escalation to full mobilization over years."" Essentially, Russia will slowly go to lower quality pools of soldiers, equip them with worse and worse equipment, and send them into worse and worse conditions. So if Russia is going to do this strategy, what does it look like right now?

First, we'll have more fear based tactics used against soldiers. Things like if you desert, we'll arrest your family. If you don't fight, your commander will kill you. Those sorts of tactics. Terrible for moral but very effective at getting helpless conscripts to fight. 

Second, we'll see forced conscripts sent into more and more dangerous missions.

Third, we'll see Russia forcing more and more people into military service. 

Four, we'll see a gradual change in the propaganda calling this conflict moving from a ""special operation"" to a ""full scale war for Russia's soul"" or something like that. 

Five, propaganda becomes increasingly the only form of information available in Russia. 

Idk if we've seen the switch in Russia to a gradual full escalation. The coming weeks and months will be crucial as I'm assuming Russia is reassessing their strategy and tactics and building out a new plan as we speak. 

Keep in mind that there is pretty much nothing stopping Russia from giving two soldiers a Lada, filling it full of equipment and fuel, and sending it to the front. Telling one of the soldiers that if they don't show up at the front, they'll arrest their family. The quality of the equipment, the survivability of the soldiers, the quality of training, or the effectiveness of the fighting force is all very debatable. It's a tactic that is simple, scalable, and brutal. Scalable, simple, and brutal tactics is kind of Russia's bread and butter. And it solves just about all of their problems at the front except for one, the attrition rate of their soldiers. And I honestly don't think Russia's brass see the attrition rate of their soldiers as a major problem. 

Obviously, the political fallout of sending two soldiers to the front in a Lada would be severe right now. A gradual escalation over years, maybe not. After Russia burns through all of their tanks, APCs, and aircraft. What is left?

So my question to you is this, if we don't see an end to the conflict soon, what does the long term outlook look like?

Sanctions will not change much in the short term, certainly not as much as the arms and intelligence that we're feeding the Ukrainians. Fundamentally, they're a tool for hemming in Russia over the weeks and months, as it becomes harder for them to import, as well reducing long term trade with Russia and the West.

I didn't. I wrote that it would yield ""\~1.4 million conscripts"", but those conscripts wouldn't all (or even mostly) come directly from the 2 aforementioned sectors. Halving the workforce in those sectors, however, would allow the freeing up of an equivalent number of conscripts throughout the rest of the economy.

&gt;I can actually provide a source for the claim that the vast majority of soldiers are not combat troops.

That's not what you wrote. You wrote: ""**Most of those are clercs and office workers**, some support.""

Again - what's your evidence?

I can actually provide a source for the claim that the vast majority of soldiers are not combat troops. It's called any every single source that describes combat composition. Combat troops are only 10-15% of the armed forces.

If Putin still wants to achieve maximalist aims in Ukraine - i.e. occupy large swathes of the country and enforce regime change - then it's increasingly clear that Russia has zero chance of doing that with the forces currently in theatre. That's why there has been talk about chemical weapons - those maximalist war aims will require an escalation from Russia, that will then be matched by an escalation from the West. Whether it's mobilising for total war or using WMDs, either will prompt a strong response from the West, and possibly send the situation into an escalatory spiral.

&gt;The Treaty of Lisbon strengthens the solidarity between EU countries in dealing with external threats by introducing a mutual defence clause (Article  42(7) of the Treaty on European Union). This clause provides that if an EU country is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other EU countries have an obligation to aid and assist it by all the means in their power, in accordance with Article  51 of the United Nations Charter.  
  
This obligation of mutual defence is binding on all EU countries. However, it does not affect the neutrality of certain EU countries and is consistent with the commitments of EU countries which are NATO members.  
  
This provision is supplemented by the solidarity clause (Article  222 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU) which provides that EU countries are obliged to act jointly where an EU country is the victim of a terrorist attack or a natural or man-made disaster.

You're sending waitresses, hostesses, elderly cleaning ladies as well as old janitors, 40-50 yr old business bosses, managers and so on to fight as light infantry? The young male population is distributed across all sectors, it's not concentrates in working in hotels.

This is a very bad take, one that reveals you to be ignorant of the realities of wartime mobilization.

The ""waitresses, hostesses, etc."" aren't the ones sent to the front. Rather, reservists with previous military experience are mobilized for military service throughout the economy, whereas the sectors that aren't critical to the functioning of the economy see their workers **mobilized for civilian service** as replacements for the conscripted young men.

This is, by the way, how mobilization worked for all countries during WW2 and, although I don't have specific datapoints for the latter, in all likelihood WW1.

&gt;Russia didn't have 2 million combat troops cycle through it's military in the last 5 year.

Who said anything about ""combat troops""? Russia has 2 million reservists with active service within the last 5 years, for all arms.

&gt;Most of those are clercs and office workers, some support.

I'll be surprised if you can provide a source for that assertion.

&gt;I agree with your point on logistics. People here have way too of a simplistic approach to it.

Yes. It is said that ""amateurs talk about tactics and professionals study logistics"", but most people have an amateurish understanding of logistics.

&gt;Russia is not prepared for mass mobilization because it was not preparing for mass mobilization

Russia's very force structure is based on limited readiness and partial manning of units that are meant to be brought to establishment strength after calling-up the previous years' conscripts.

&gt;Think years to stand up 1 million combat troops with the ability to deploy and aupport them beyond your borders.

There's no reason to think so.

&gt;Almost no country nowadays is prepared for mass mobilization

This is a simplistic take. Countries were far from perfectly prepared for mass mobilization during the World Wars either, and especially during the First. Mobilization was a partially pre-planned, partially ad hoc process with many an expedient.

What I mean isn't that they are in safety, or anything about them not living through the awful side of war. Not even close, I'm actually talking about the opposite when I voiced my concerns about how, if they aren't kitted out good enough, not well connected or used as a pawn, they especially will suffer the worst fears war can provide when the shells start hitting around them and tearing up their whole squad

But that's not really what I meant with humans getting some kind of enjoyment of combat. Also I don't mean they're in fact the objective apex predator. There's always a bigger one. I'm talking more figuratively. I now found a relevant source for this point, a veteran that seems to fall into the category of people that want to experience combat, again,..: https://www.newsweek.com/us-american-volunteer-ukraine-invasion-war-destroyed-russian-tanks-1691766
""I kind of feel like I'm on an awesome very dangerous vacation,"" Vasquez tweeted after leaving the U.S.

I'm with you on the ones that won't be lucky enough to have somewhat control of their situation, the ones getting paralyzed because the only thing they experience over thousands of hours is the existential stress and fear  over the invisible and ruthless death from above (in form of attack UAVs, shelling, rockets,...). While this is only my speculation, I think that's the top difference (with the mindset and other psychological factors) if people will remember war as somewhat enjoyable in a dirty way or pure horror that will mentally cripple them for the rest of their lives.

I can just speculate on why this occurs, and also I don't want to judge. Just the objective observation that not even close to 100% of soldiers will find the experience of combat pure, terrible horror. 

In some cases that's definitely a good thing, in that regard that the human mind gets used to the horrors, because otherwise they'd suffer even more than they already do. 
But in other cases it's definitely a big issue of humanity - people who lived through unspeakable acts of violence are way more likely to commit violence themselves in the future. We see that in child abuse victims, we see it when genocide/ethnic cleansing happened and the victims pay it back even more bloody than what they experienced (circle of violence, as we saw in many genocides/civil wars - a spiral of escalation of violence, getting from unspeakable to ... even worse)

So, even if it sounds totally messed up from a western POV that hasn't seen any wars, there are people who enjoy combat - sure, some are sitting in the most modern fighter aircraft and are comparably safe, but it very much also applies to infantry. 
While I'm with you on the point that there aren't any remotely sane people who will enjoy things like the volunteers against the Serbs lived through (I talked about it some comments down), it doesn't seem like the Ukrainians are even close to being 0% in control, and getting brutally wiped out without any control in the combat situation. There will be many soldiers, volunteers or not, that win their respective fight. Pop the tank open with an NLAW, successfully ambushing a Russian squad, successfully fighting them back into retreat, etc...and some subtypes of human minds will get an enjoyment in successfully fighting. While being fully aware of the young conscripts that just brutally died when the tank cooked off, and that they too just wanted to live, just like them. And it most definitely will haunt them, but still, this subtype will go on deployment again, will look for possibilities to go into combat again, even if that means to volunteer to counter an invasion of a country they didn't give a single shit about two months earlier

I can't tell you what the exact reason for it. But it's a fact that it happens way more often than we thought. Some people love the rush of combat, and I'd argue that it is a common trait of humans if the situation sets the ground for it. And my thoughts are that it is a potentially dangerous trait, especially paired with hate and grief it can lead to truly horrible things to happen.",7b22bcd066361be940dcf72394f46874149096a4,True,False,,,,,0,1648219356,,0,{},i22joyi,True,t3_tfuaff,False,True,t1_i1dtyyq,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tfuaff/the_state_of_foreign_volunteers_in_ukraine/i22joyi/,1648219375,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648190556.0,

I think this is the first real official statement we've had from Russia on what it now sees as the potential endgame / minimum acceptable outcome?

Two thoughts jump to mind.

Firstly, it's interesting that they've officially revealing they had been considering both a 'whole of Ukraine' operation versus one focusing mainly on Donbas. To my eyes, the phrasing implies that the 'consideration' period was past tense, suggesting they've now dropped the 'whole of Ukraine' scenario and are scaling back to Donbas. If so, that's a positive move towards  But maybe the nuance has been lost in translation.

Secondly, and perhaps too optimistically, my gut reaction is that this is probably good news for de-escalation prospects: if Putin is now willing to 'settle' for securing Donbas/Crimea, that would reduce the likelihood of him needing to escalate to force Ukraine to concede a more ambitious settlement (eg general mobilisation, chemical weapons, tactical nuclear weapons).  It doesn't eliminate the escalation risk altogether - if Russian forces begin to collapse I fear the pressure to escalate could ramp up - but I'm a bit more relaxed than I would have been if Putin had come out and declared 'we're going to occupy all of Ukraine'.",059035b245277e938dc9112aee7b29ea17379d5c,True,False,,,,,0,1648219290,,0,{},i22jj78,False,t3_tnkipf,False,True,t1_i22hz4m,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tnkipf/ukraine_megathread_march_25/i22jj78/,1648219301,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648190490.0,

Ok this may be fluff. But its kind of the core war aim. 

They have two exposed advances towards Kyiv with long supply lines that are under attack. They will require a superb level of military ability to withdraw and risk them both being strangled for supplies or outright cut off. 

If they Kyiv front feels cut off they may collapse, if they try a withdrawal under pressure it may turn into a rout. If soldiers start gossiping they are being abandoned they will really lose heart in the mission. Those axes tie down a lot of the best of the Ukrainian army. Not to mention the potential of equipment changing hands.

A month+ in and to be frank- It seems to me that Russian military capabilities have been exposed as being either extraordinarily inadequate compared to their reported capabilities pre-invasion. Logistics, OpSec, command of mid-rank officers (and lack of morale) have been evidentially been lacking. The Russian Air Force which I thought would be the big trump card for the Russian forces- has been woefully inadequate. The fact the Ukrainians still have the ability to conduct limited sorties and have been conducting consistent drone strikes up to this point is just...bizarre to me. 

Russia (and aligned forces) have undeniable made gains. Gains that I have a difficult time seeing Ukrainian Forces reversing. Ukrainian forces from what I have read/seen have been excelling at small unit action. However- I'm not sure if that lends well to reclaiming cities like Kherson or Mauripol when it falls (barring an extraordinary thing happening). They can certainly take the villages or large towns- I just have a difficult time seeing them being able to clear out an entrenched Russian position in cities. 

However the gains have come at a significant and detrimental cost for what they have ultimately come to control. They are no where even close to toppling the Ukrainian Government- if anything the Ukrainian Government is in a vastly stronger position diplomatically, in popular support, and in *certain* aspects- militarily compared to the start of the invasion. 

At this point- unless there is more commitment from Russia itself in the form of raising/deploying more troops and/or China chooses to more directly support Russia- I no longer see Russia as being able to take all of Ukraine conventionally (even ignoring the inevitable insurgency)- I think even Kyiv may be out of the picture permanently for being captured. A point I keep on paying attention to is the fact that they still have not capture Kharkiv- a city much closer to friendly territory and a smaller (but still large) city. They haven't even managed to surround the city based on contemporary information and we are now a month into this conflict. 

All of this however- is not to say that Ukraine end up with all of its territory back in its hands. I don't believe Putin will relinquish any gains he has taken while he's still in power, never mind the Donbas Separatist regions or Crimea. I don't think anything short of the collapse of the Russian State will permit Ukraine to have the ability to reclaim those areas. 

One thing I am curious about is whether or not Belarus will enter the war formally... eventually. I doubt their inclusion will dramatically shift the balance (unless a fantastical and extremely unlikely scenario of them joining Ukraine occurs) but it is still something I'm watching out for.",c548d88371fa51d0a0e28a349af785e040590532,True,False,,,,,0,1648212271,,0,{},i223z3w,False,t3_tnkipf,False,True,t3_tnkipf,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tnkipf/ukraine_megathread_march_25/i223z3w/,1648212282,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648183471.0,

Ukraine are pushing Russia along the flanks of what is looking to be a salient. They are not encircled. What is likely is that Ukraine is able to push light infantry patrols to the rear and interdict some supply convoys. 

That said the Russians in the salient may be starting to get a bit worried. They are pretty physically cut off from other large Russian formations if things do start going wrong for them.

In terms of not getting absolutely bodied by Ukrainians with NLAWs &amp; Bayraktars &amp; tractors with tow chains.

The Russians have only found success in situations where they enjoy a definitive technological advantage, and judging by their casualty count and equipment losses in this conflict so far they haven't got a snowball's chance in hell of recovering that at this point. The Ukrainians are already mounting counteroffensives to retake Russian territorial gains and it's been less than a month since this conflict started.

Morale has plainly collapsed, casualties and personnel losses are approaching 20%, and their logistical capabilities are (if we're being kind) an *[absolute disaster](https://warontherocks.com/2021/11/feeding-the-bear-a-closer-look-at-russian-army-logistics/)*. Depending on railheads to invade a country that doesn't even share the same rail gauge is so dumb it almost defies belief that they thought they could sustain any kind of large-scale offensive...but as we've all seen from that FSB analyst leak, they actively punished any critical thinking regarding this invasion prior to attempting it.

In every war that saw to extended mobilization, food production and the supply chain, especially for civilians, were sharply disrupted. World War Two saw to significant famines across the world, and only the Americas were spared. This was partially due to disruptions in pre-war supply chains, but also in the egregious decline in food production as young men were drafted to fight in the war. Nazi Germany stayed in as long as it did through the wholesale looting of Europe, and the Allies through American/Argentine agricultural exports.

Yes, logistics grow and shrink, but to do so requires significant bureaucracies dedicated to planning the timetables, the delivery of goods and supplies, their procurement, etc. WWI required an unprecedented level of organization of train timetables, reserve mobilization stations, etc. Certainly, Russia has soldiers who have previously served: now tell me, do they know who and where they are now? Have they made plans for who and how they'll get to the front? Do they have the supplies and pre-planned locations for them to be orrganized into cohesive units?

At the same time, they deliberately make their missiles nuclear capable, but do not specify how many nuclear warheads they have and which units host them.

This is precisely the opposite of what the USA and USSR did during the cold war. Both the US and USSR went to great lengths to not confuse their conventional and nuclear armed forces, to avoid the other side from responding to a conventional threat with nuclear retaliation.

Since China mixes its nuclear and conventional arsenal, China is having its cake and eating it too. To top it all off, Chinese doctrine is ""Decisive First Strike"" which emphasizes a massive launch of ballistic and cruise missiles as a first strike against all regional targets. This is extremely destabilizing from a doctrinal standpoint.

&amp;#x200B;

So how should the US and allies deal with all this? There are 2 ways, each takes a different path. One is deterring China, two is defeating China.

1) Arm Taiwan, Japan, and Korea with survivable nuclear triads and 2nd strike capability to restore nuclear parity to the region and deter Chinese aggression. This option is sure to enrage China, but if executed successfully, it would prevent war.

2) When China launches its ""Decisive first strike"" against Taiwan before invading, the US needs to coordinate with Taiwan such that the conventionally armed Taiwanese cruise missiles and ballistic missiles destroy Chinese early warning radars and command and control centers. The, the US Ohio class boomers in the east Pacific need to immediately launch all their Tridents at Chinese nuclear targets after confirming that Chinese early warning radars are temporarily down.

Yes, this is full scale nuclear war; don't say it's ""unthinkable"" because there are quite a few people who study it extensively. China would see incoming Taiwanese missiles and know they are conventionally armed, so China would not retaliate with nuclear weapons against Taiwan. China is fully expecting to take several barrages and waves of Taiwanese missiles in the first few hours of their ""reunification"". However, because China would not nuke Taiwan for destroying their earl warning radars, it leaves a window of opportunity for the US to strike inland Chinese targets. They key is timing it right. Tridents hit targets within 20 minutes, so to eliminate all Chinese nuclear silos and known launch positions, they must be certain the long range radars are inoperable. The US Navy would also need to torpedo Chinese SSBNs in the south China sea and Bohai sea. This is fairly straightforward, since the US already has dozens of fast attack subs shadowing the Chinese fleet.

Any other option that involves naval conflict between the US and China would likely escalate; it is solidly in the USA's best interest to annihilate the Chinese nuclear forces in the first hour of a conflict, so long as there is a window of opportunity to do so without trigger a launch-on-warning response.",8d034400666d2bb93efbd9f58d02516b7e64a0bd,True,False,,,,,0,1648207078,,0,{},i21v44t,False,t3_tl6j1k,False,True,t1_i1zqoqp,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tl6j1k/missile_production_capacity_us_and_pacific_allies/i21v44t/,1648207095,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648178278.0,

I think Putin spent 20 years building an image that rewards him for being brutal and interprets it as showing strength, just like we had a lot of citizens in the US who liked when Trump talked about torturing the families of terrorists, and whatever he said about painting our planes red and nuking moscow.

The older generation still love him, and while he lost some credit there by cutting pensions, I would put his approval as closer to 55-60% right now, and I doubt slaughtering civilians would push it down much below 40%.

I think there are several factors that makes Ukraine unique and I wouldn't trust the statistics blindly:

* The nature of the war is completely different to Chechnya or Syria. Chechnya is tiny and the occupation zone of Syria is quite small too. Russia has/had almost complete air superiority in both situations. Ukraine is obviously different. 
* Domestic situation is also completely different. This was a planned 3-5 day invasion, not some protracted war of attrition. Sanctions and domestic support is definitely starting to change. How is it changing? We don't know yet. There's definitely a completely different level of attrition being experienced in Ukraine. Compared to Syria, it's due to the nature of operations. Compared to Chechnya, it is due to the sheer scale and size of the overall conflict. 
* Unlike Chechens or Syrians, Ukrainians are a brotherly nation. It was easy to justify destroying these people, but the Ukrainian nation is closer to home for Russians. It affects morale for sure.

Tactically in the scope of the other insurgencies the USSR and RF after have fought Afghanistan went reasonably well and followed the doctrine this paper outlines. But Afghanistan has a bunch of unique things about it that make it a nightmare to fight in, as the NATO found out after and the British found out before. First Afghanistan is an incredibly multi-cultural nation as it straddles the border into the Middle East and into Asia this makes finding a balance and appeasing the whole population is incredibly difficult, Arab and African nations share this phenomena in that the Middle East is split along secretarial lines and Africa is split along tribal lines but Afghanistan is a combination of both. Second Afghanistan is surrounded by developed regional powers, to the west is Iran and to the east it borders both China and Pakistan. While not necessarily developed in the western sense all of those nations are strong enough states that they presented a significant risk to Russia and none of those states were particularly friendly to Russia. Iran traded with Russia for weapons but the Russians were also supplying their opponents in iraq with weapons. Pakistan was extremely close to the US and the Chinese at that point were extremely combative towards the USSR. 

These 2 things combined made it so that a prolonged war was unwinnable because the Russians simply couldn’t bomb the populace into submission like it would end up doing in Chechnya. The insurgency constantly had friendly nations to harbour it and help funnel weapons in and the diversity of the nation itself made a singular mission structure impossible to follow as fighting and creating alliances in different parts of the country required markedly different types of diplomacy. Compare this to Chechnya where the area surrounding it was ostensibly Russian controlled or influenced and all the material support came from jihadis distant lands the Russians in Afghanistan were never able to acquire any sort of foothold to actually carry out the operations they would have liked to.

&gt; Recent Russian military campaigns in Chechnya and Syria, which featured indiscriminate violence and collective punishment, make clear that modern Russian armed forces adhere to an authoritarian counterinsurgency strategy. Moreover, an analysis of the historical track record reveals that this brutal approach has not only become a trademark of Russian counterinsurgency but has also brought unprecedented success. Of the twenty-four rebellions and insurgencies encountered between 1917 and 2017 Russia (or the Soviet Union) “won” twenty-one of these conflicts—an astonishing 87.5 percent—where “won” means that “the insurgency is militarily defeated and its organization destroyed, or the war ends without any political concessions granted to insurgent forces.” This makes Russia one of the world’s most effective modern counterinsurgents.

You had the PRC using the long route of going out to the Pacific and back to transit between coastal ports in Northern China and Southern China. This is reflected in the more militarised culture of Chinese flagged civilian ships carrying weapons like automatic heavy machine guns and operating as if it was a militia back in the day under dual leadership of the state owned shipping company and the PLAN.

You'd have to be either completely blind or a russian sympathizer to not see it. There has been plenty of evidence of very indiscriminate shelling. Difficult to say if they are targeting specific civillian structures on purpose, but they are definitely not being ""tactical"" about their shelling. Indiscriminate shelling could be part of the ""plan B"" for this invasion, where they are just trying to force concessions by incurring civillian casualties and make it costly for Zelensky to engage in war of attrition with them.  

You also have a very strange definition of ""invasion"". Maybe English is not your first language though, so I'm not going to hold this against you.

Yes, it was Plan A, which failed  - now they are stuck in an invasion (yes, invasion, and a conventional war - not a special operation like they wanted) which they are completely unprepared for.

&gt;I’m not even sure what you guys study to even remotely believe this is an invasion. Have you guys read about Russia economy? Military budget, capacity, assets, you know, the ENABLERS of force projection? 
  
Let me guess - you just started your Masters in IR or Pol Sci? I would say it doesn't make too much sense to approach this viewing Russia as an all-knowing, calculating, rational actor. Look at this situation as an emergent outcome of a bunch of individuals in power making decisions, based on their vested interests. Putin is the key individual here and while he does have some belief-based motivations to continue this war, I think that he is mainly motivated by his survival (political and actual physical survival). He got himself into a type of conflict he cannot easily win or has any experience with. He probably anticipates that if he backs down, he might not be able to project power domestically any longer and will be ousted. So, he continues  a war he cannot win, waiting for an opportunity to turn this around somehow. Maybe his ""Plan B"" will work and he can get something good out of Zelensky, who knows.

All of a sudden all the posturing and nuclear threats (likes which Russia routinely does) are no longer just chauvinistic posturing for the nationalists at home that every diplomat safely ignores, no they become actual existential threats. If Putin gets away with nuking Kiev what is to say he won't launch a ICBM horror on Nato before they have a chance to respond, it becomes a very real threat. Both Soviets and Americans understood this dynamic during cold war, which is why both as much as they postured never actually considered using nukes in their wars.

Not to mention a response from the public would be to demand blood, 100x the one we saw when the war is started. And as much as we talk about western countries essentially being controlled by corporations (and there is a lot of truth to it), when an overwhelming portion of the public demands something politicians hands are forced. I can guarantee you none of the corporations are happy about the sanctions on Russia, it hurts their bottom line a lot. Look at Nordstream 2, I was assured Germany would never touch it, and look what happened.

Now I don't think Nato would start to preemptively nuke Russia, no, nukes are dumb and bad and accomplish none of the military goals.

So we know that their first strategy was to push the Ukraine government out in a few days. And that failed. Spectacularly. 

Then they moved to a slow advance, but their logistics failed. Now they are running out of logistical supplies and are in stalemate. So that strategy failed. 

And that brings us to today. The world is against Russia. Most Russian citizens believe Russia is being picked on and is under attack. They need to fight or the Russian equivalent of ""Red Dawn"" will happen.

I'm assuming the political situation in Russia will not change. This assumption is based on the only rule of law in Russia is the way of the gun. And Putin has somehow managed to remain in power for 22 years, meaning he is capable of dealing with dissent. Dissent that wants to murder him. Much like Stalin. And anybody who doesn't agree has already left or is leaving now. So he'll be left with only the true believers. Or at least a large majority of true believers.

Putin is backed into a corner. He has to win or he will die. And the only thing Putin cares about is himself. And as long as the war is still going, he's not losing. 

What do they do now? 

Well it's simple. Full mobilization. Russia has approximately 30 million men between 20-50. They could probably get 1/4-1/3 to fight. That's 7-10 million soldiers. They have the equipment and capability to arm all of them with simple weapons (Aks and RPGs) and feed them. Even with sanctions. That's enough to lose millions of soldiers and still have a million left over to rape, pillage, and brutalize Ukraine. 

I think we've hit a new phase of the war where it will get more brutal and more deadly. Mainly for Russians. 

So what does the war look like in this case? Well, less mechanized. And if it draws out, it'll be a trench warfare stalemate. 

Where does this leave Ukraine? Well, they have to win, and win fast. A window of about a month or two and then setup a strong, impenetrable line. Otherwise, Russia will mobilize their millions of bodies to grind the Ukrainian army down, just like what they did to Nazi Germany. 

Of course, there are way way more moving parts. Poland entering the war. Belarus revolting. Putin dying. Nuclear weapons. NATO entering the conflict.

I think that’s where we are.

I for one believe this possibility to be VERY low, almost fantasy AND I think there’s a lot of western narrative to sell ads and build an evil image of Russia, AS USUAL.

Putin isn’t crazy, but if cornered, like ANY beast of this planet, he will react and I’ve seen him saying that there’s no need for a world without Russia in it (regarding nuclear escalation).

The one and only reason why the US isn't shredding Russian armor from the sky in defense of Ukraine is because the US is (rightfully) afraid of nukes.  The US believes that if they get directly involved, the risk of it going nuclear is too high.  This is clear both from the words the US government is publicly saying, and by their actual actions.

If Russia uses nukes on Ukraine, nothing changes about the US reasoning when it comes to not getting involved.  It actually gets worse.  If Putin demonstrates he really will use nukes, that makes his ""bluff"" vastly more believable.  If the US is already too afraid to intervene because is fears a nuclear exchange, Russia using nukes will have the US even more (completely rationally) fearful. 

&gt;A completely believable response would be limited direct intervention, such as enforcing a no-fly zone or doing limited cruise missile strikes on a small amount of military targets in retribution. The latter option was how the US responded to Syria's use of chemical weapons in 2017. Obviously the response would need to be considerably more measured, as the US would not launch weapons into Russian territory.

Syria didn't have nuclear weapons.  

If that isn't enough, and it should be, the US drew a clear red line against them using chemical weapons.  This is the opposite of what is happening here.  Russia definitely has nuclear weapons, and the US **HASN'T** drawn a red line against Russia using them on Ukraine.  The US has certainly threatened consequences, but it hasn't threatened military consequences against Russia for anything other than attack a NATO nation.  The reason why the US drew the red line to direct military intervention at attacks against NATO and not at nuclear weapons being used on Ukraine, is because that's actually where the US red line is.

Yes, it's no big deal, just Germans pretend that it is because it would be very inconvenient for them to pay more.

EU overall gets 40% of its gas from Russia, and has some gas reserves. Short term, it would be mix of:

* importing gas from other sources
* generating electricity in other ways, like more coal, and not turning off nuclear power plants

If they did manage to find that many volunteers or decided to use the new round of conscripts, it might become even more of a quagmire for Russia as they would need more logistical support than is available.",6cd7c9f4c9ba6439a827e9feacf78dab660b3646,True,False,,,,,0,1648169878,,0,{},i208yzv,False,t3_tm3o0j,False,True,t1_i1zz5oi,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tm3o0j/ukraine_megathread_march_24/i208yzv/,1648169902,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648141078.0,

The other day an interesting discussion came up in the comment section of another post. At issue is the question of whether the Chinese military use a mission command style of leadership. Or what the authors here described as command control where orders are rigidly given down the chain of command to be rigidly followed. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_command

Now this work is certainly not definitive. And the authors themselves admit that they have ""little reliable firsthand information about PLA Navy command culture"". This is unsurprising as the Chinese military is far less open than those in the West. So this is not the end of a conversation or in research on the topic. To the contrary this work leaves me wanting to know more and will share credible sources when I find them. 

It is however a credible data point at least in that in the view of major western think tanks is that the PLA is tied to Leninist principles of leadership that preclude commanders taking the initiative. 

---------------------

Another reason why this subject came up is a recent article in *The Atlantic* about an account from the front lines in Ukraine. It also discusses the Russian style of command and doctrine as being a major impediment to the capabilities of the Russian military. It is a captivating read but its veracity is completely unknown, so it is likely not material for a direct submission to r/credibledefense. 

https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/american-volunteer-foreign-fighters-ukraine-russia-war/627604/

&gt; This brought Jed to the second subject he wanted to discuss: Russian tactics and doctrine. He said he had spent much of the past few weeks in the trenches northwest of Kyiv. “The Russians have no imagination,” he said. “They would shell our positions, attack in large formations, and when their assaults failed, do it all over again. Meanwhile, the Ukrainians would raid the Russian lines in small groups night after night, wearing them down.” Jed’s observation echoed a conversation I’d had the day before with Andriy Zagorodnyuk. After Russia’s invasion of the Donbas in 2014, Zagorodnyuk oversaw a number of reforms to the Ukrainian military that are now bearing fruit, chief among them changes in Ukraine’s military doctrine; then, from 2019 to 2020, he served as minister of defense.

&gt; Russian doctrine relies on centralized command and control, while mission-style command and control—as the name suggests—relies on the individual initiative of every soldier, from the private to the general, not only to understand the mission but then to use their initiative to adapt to the exigencies of a chaotic and ever-changing battlefield in order to accomplish that mission. Although the Russian military has modernized under Vladimir Putin, it has never embraced the decentralized mission-style command-and-control structure that is the hallmark of NATO militaries, and that the Ukrainians have since adopted.

&gt; “The Russians don’t empower their soldiers,” Zagorodnyuk explained. “They tell their soldiers to go from Point A to Point B, and only when they get to Point B will they be told where to go next, and junior soldiers are rarely told the reason they are performing any task. This centralized command and control can work, but only when events go according to plan. When the plan doesn’t hold together, their centralized method collapses. No one can adapt, and you get things like 40-mile-long traffic jams outside Kyiv.”


&gt; The individual Russian soldier’s lack of knowledge corresponded with a story Jed told me, one that drove home the consequences of this lack of knowledge on the part of individual Russian soldiers. During a failed night assault on his trench, a group of Russian soldiers got lost in the nearby woods. “Eventually, they started calling out,” he said. “I couldn’t help it; I felt bad. They had no idea where to go.”",85415488ccaf16b4c10bbd2f4d98763b63848559,True,False,,,,,0,1648168063,,0,{},i204y5q,True,t3_tn98zk,False,True,t1_i202fq9,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tn98zk/command_and_control_in_us_naval_competition_with/i204y5q/,1648168080,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648139263.0,

The salient question thus becomes, from the perspective of Jewish security: are the Houthis a threat to Jews anywhere in the world? The answer to that is a resounding ""no"", with the qualifier that within Yemen itself, the (very small) residual Jewish community - roughly 50 individuals - have suffered discrimination at the hands of the Houthis, albeit not rising to the level of murder. Which is obviously tragic in itself. It is also, however, not in any way alleviated by the current war.

Thus, the lens of ""Jewish security"" is not the right one to look at this conflict. A much better lens is to ask whether or not the Saudi intervention has improved the situation. And here the answer is also a resounding ""no"": the Saudis have wrecked Yemen, directly and indirectly contributing to the deaths of more than 377,000 people, to say nothing of the millions of others who have had to flee their homes.

And they haven't even defeated the Houthis, or even much changed the frontlines as they stood in March 2015.

Thus, my contention is that a better outcome would have been for the Saudis not to intervene. The Houthi-dominated regime would certainly not have been progressive, but it wouldn't have been a threat to the international order, nor to Israeli and non-Israeli Jews worldwide. Indeed, given how Shia Muslims constitute a minority of the Yemeni population, it would have had to integrate Sunni elements to form a workable government.

Instead the Saudis have intervened, wrecked Yemen, and facilitated the rise of the Houthis as the defenders of the country against external aggression. To say nothing of the hundreds of thousands of dead and millions of displaced.

Exactly how the fate of the Jews became the salient issue in this tragic story, one can only wonder.",ad0e27b201f61745a75b4b530cd21f31bcd42dd7,True,False,,,,,0,1648167229,,0,{},i2032uz,False,t3_tjlix2,False,True,t1_i1zxjo0,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tjlix2/when_would_the_russian_force_in_ukraine_be/i2032uz/,1648167241,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648138429.0,
