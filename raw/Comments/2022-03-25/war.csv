I agree. Not only that but most of the things posted are straight propaganda.

Also I know that the world does care what is happening, my point is that most people don't actually care about the suffering of the Ukrainian people and are only talking like they do beocuse it's popular.

The war in Ukraine has been going on since 2014 yet nobody uttered a word compared to this.

The war in the in Yemen is going on since 2015 yet nobody uttered a word compared to this.

Wars of aggression almost exactly like this one, where a superpower compromises a sovereignty of another country, were happening pretty much non-stop since the WW2 yet nobody talks about them either.

1643.0,[],False,,huntskikbut,,,[],,,,text,t2_5mw0a,False,False,"&gt; There’s an ideological difference between Ukraine and Russia

This is a fundamental disagreement between us I suppose. I see both sides as plutocracies hyped up on capitalism. If you believe in the promises of western liberal democracy then I see how you could see that differently. 

&gt; They have refused and so now are either going to be annexed and forcibly joined, or beaten to a point where Putin gets what he wants.

I'd say the state has refused, not They as in the Ukrainian people. And this is not a set in stone thing, I think we'll see a bartered peace rather than an unconditional surrender. 

&gt; If the Ukrainian people don’t win or get a stalemate, then it’s most likely the end of Ukraine

I disagree here as well. I find it highly unlikely that Russia will attempt to annex all of Ukraine. If you consider a neutral or Russia-aligned Ukraine to be the end of Ukraine, then sure. But I'd note that for the majority of the history of Ukraine this has been the case.

But again, I find this to be a heavy handed nationalist argument. 

&gt; And the Ukrainian people can’t just go back home if it’s a stalemate since the Ukrainian Government can’t afford to rebuild their houses with the country in ruins.

And you think a defeated Russia would be able to provide enough reparations for this? 

&gt; Explain how that isn’t a life or death fight?

The people painting this as an existential struggle are the people currently in power in Ukraine, and for them it certainly is life and death. But I'm simply not a nationalist so associating the people with the state apparatus is foreign to me 🤷‍♂️ the people will survive (assuming they can avoid being killed trying to maintain the state, which conscription complicates), the culture will definitely survive, and frankly the state likely will survive too.

The people are always the victims of war, but saying it's life or death implies you must fight or die, which is certainly not true unless someone is forcing you to fight. So I suppose it is in a sense given conscription on both sides, but it doesn't have to be -- and both sides have the ability to stop it from being so.",65d8071c77f7be481f7540e2dfb5dc1c1c61fa98,True,True,,,,,0,1648240505,,0,{},i2413or,False,t3_tnkeuh,False,True,t1_i23xl74,/r/war/comments/tnkeuh/the_russian_pilot_admits_that_he_bombed_civilian/i2413or/,1648240519,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1648211705.0,,,,

In my family, for three generations, we have always looked to help any American we meet. Picking up hitchhikers and tourists and showing just the best goddam time you can imagine. Passing them around our friends, taking them fishing and hunting, putting them up for weeks. We feel we owe American people for what that one guy did.

[The Marines have been working on a land based version but as far as I know it is not a deployable weapon yet.](https://youtu.be/TmhuQqPcOtY)

[A hot launch meaning the engine ignites immediately.](https://youtu.be/TmhuQqPcOtY) hot launches tend to damage the internal workings of the launch platform. The Navy gets around this by encasing the missiles in an armored box, the entire box is replaced once the ship puts into port.

A cold launch is where they use gas to push the missile out before the engine ignights. This prevents damage to launcher and makes it easy to reload

Fun side note, Russian silo based ICBM's are cold launched, the leftover doctirine from the Soviet era is to reload the silos and launch again, this forces the U.S. to nuke empty silos. American ICBM's are hot launches, this destroys the silo and prevents its reuse. The reason that is significant is the Americans weren't planning a first strike so if a nuclear war was to break out, there would already be warheads headed for the silos, the U.S.S.R. was planning for a first strike so they made them reloadable.",bc564b3ad69fa99dafe9eb48f0aa4998630bcf90,True,False,,,,,0,1648224794,,0,{},i22xhq8,False,t3_tn806r,False,True,t1_i22ptul,/r/war/comments/tn806r/can_a_ukraine_get_a_tomahawk/i22xhq8/,1648224810,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1648195994.0,,,,

The west uses the chain of command, a flag grade officer (Generals and Admirals) will receive tasking from the President. The flag grades figure out what resources are going to be needed and how to make said resources available to field grade officers, that is the major, lieutenant colonel and colonel, level. Most of the planning on how to fight the enemy happens at this level. All of that is relayed to those that execute the orders, the company grade officers, that is second lieutenant, first lieutenant, captain and the enlisted/non-commissioned officers.

So you go into battle, a forward operating base with the field grade officers is shelled, they all die, those executing the orders will take the initiative and carry on the fight, the flag grade officers replace the fallen as quick as possible with resources available. The fight doesn't stop.

It's taking the initiative, if someone higher ranking than you dies in combat, the next highest ranking person continues on and takes over that role.

Where it gets really interesting is when the company grade officers die, with the American military the company grade officers are like a fire hose nozzle, you point the firehouse to put out the fire, they will decide just how much force is needed for an objective, when they die that nozzle is gone, the enlisted NCO's have historically used the absolute maximum force possible, all of that thought that went into preventing war crimes with the officers sort of goes right out the door.


that isn't how the Russian military works.

The Russian military can't just take the initiative, when you lose your commander's they don't have non-commissioned officers that can just take over, that's not how they're trained. They're training to take orders no matter what, they aren't leaders.

Western puppets are usually ruthless dictators.... he was a puppet and they just wanted to depose him because they had other plans for Iraq and he was starting to get rogue for them.

Did you also even know that AQ offered the Saudis to fight Saddam for them? Did you even know that both AQ and the Ba'athist were enemies not allies?

You don't know what you're talking about, you're just a typical American being played..... even if you don't care about Middle eastern people's lives that gets taken by US airstrikes, you ought to care about your tax dollar. 

You have never been to Iraq, you have never talked to Iraqis, you have never seen the effects of your countries bombings.... so please don't talk bs about shit you obviously have no idea about.
