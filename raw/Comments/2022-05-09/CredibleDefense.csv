Did the VDV have tens of the newest surface combatants and hundreds of new fighters covering them? How about an A2/AD system umbrella?

&gt;The US doesn't do large scale amphibious assaults, their navy isn't prepared for a D-Day scale invasion. No navy is, that's not a capability you just have ready to pull out of your ass, it requires targeted planning for a specific operation. Tell the US navy that they need to invade Taiwan by sea next year and see what the response is. A part of it would be ""We need a few hundred more littoral combat ships and a fuckload of landing craft.""

And what do you think China has spent decades building? To include their paramilitary naval forces?

The quotations around surprise are mandatory because good fucking luck keeping the largest maritime invasion in history a secret in the 2020s when even private companies have their own spy satellites.

Ah yes, Taiwan's 80,000 active forces and poorly trained reserve conscripts that rarely get Western equipment is going to be repeat Hostomel airport, when Chinese fighters are a 10 minute flight away

Basically, **a negotiated settlement is for the time being impossible**. Ukraine's minimum goals (the return to the pre-24 Feb borders) are very far from Russia's minimum goals (the Ukrainian recognition of the separation of the entire Crimea&amp;Donetsk&amp;Lugansk oblasts).

Therefore the **war must continue**. The Ukrainian strength is growing thanks to mobilisation and the Western supply of weapons. The Russian professional army is already proving inadequate to achieve significant advances. Each soldier it loses cannot be replaced. Soon it will be inadequate to hold the front line.

Moscow seems to be betting on ""things working out somehow"" - either the Ukrainian front finally cracking or Kyiv getting tired of the losses and the damage inflicted to the infrastructure. That is wishful thinking of people unwilling to face the harsh realities. It is now (and has been for some time) obvious that Russia is going to suffer a defeat unless it escalates. The later Moscow accepts this fact the worse the situation will be and the bigger the escalation required to contain it.

The possible outcomes are:

1. **Russia is defeated**. This is unlikely, as the consequences to Russia and the Kremlin are so momentous that the consequences of the escalation are preferable by far.
2. **Russia ""escalates to win""**:  
2.a. A total or partial mobilisation. It would take several months and, while it would make a victory likely, it would not guarantee it. The war would last at least a year and the human cost would be in the hundreds of thousands.  
2.b Tactical nuclearisation. It would practically guarantee a military victory, but the reputational cost would be enormous. The escalation risks would be difficult to predict.  


The only alternative to the outcomes 1. and 2. is a negotiated solution if the two sides (the West and Ukraine vs Russia) at some point become aware of the fact that the risks inherent in the escalation far outweigh the possible benefits. This, unfortunately, appears unlikely. The West is now obviously committed to the idea of a decisive defeat of Russia.

You can't launch an invasion with a week or two of prep time and you can't delay it for weeks in the run up to zero hour if the weather degrades. This limits you to a very narrow window in the year when you are statistically likely to get favourable weather. This window is known to the Taiwanese also.

&gt;81 miles is well within range of thousands of helicopters launched from an unsinkable amphibious assault platform called mainland China

\*Muffled VDV noises*

&gt;Guess how the US does amphibious assaults and from what distance?

The US doesn't do large scale amphibious assaults, their navy isn't prepared for a D-Day scale invasion. No navy is, that's not a capability you just have ready to pull out of your ass, it requires targeted planning for a specific operation. Tell the US navy that they need to invade Taiwan by sea next year and see what the response is. A part of it would be ""We need a few hundred more littoral combat ships and a fuckload of landing craft.""

&gt;Everyone thinks these assaults require mass infantry huddled in Higgins boats

You need to get your army on shore in numbers that overwhelm your enemy's defensive advantage if you actually want to be successful. If you aren't landing literally hundreds of thousands of troops and armour as part of your invasion then you're just going to get Hostomel airport part deux once the defenders react to your ""surprise"" attack.

What I mean by that is that while we don't know exactly whether Putin will escalate or how exactly he would do so, we can be fairly confident that Russia would climb the escalation ladder *slowly.* This is both out of caution, but also to preserve options for future escalation if necessary. 

I'm not going to comment on possible outcomes but I do believe that Putin faces the choice of escalation, stagnation, or de-escalation. 

Escalation means some form of war declaration or mobilization and this carries a host of political risks. Putin's reluctance to do so already suggests that those political risks are *real* and potentially severe. 

Stagnation means allowing the front to settle down and reverting to a 2014-2022 status-quo but on a much wider front and hoping that the economic strangulation of Ukraine pushes them to the table (as well as perhaps a fracturing of Western will). This seems... unlikely to me, and stagnation benefits Ukraine who is receiving a steady supply of high-end weapons and manpower.

De-escalation means perhaps a negotiated return to the Feb 23 lines and some sort of formal resolution to the Crimean issue (perhaps some Hong Kong-esque 100 year lease or something). It's unclear if this is actually feasible for Putin. Some say ""yes of course, he controls Russia it's no big"" others have suggested that this would be the end of his regime. It would certainly be a humiliating defeat and I have difficulty imagining this would be cost free.

There's a lot of bad blood to this day from Ukrainians collaborating with the Nazis, and some of those guys are still revered by certain folks in Ukraine. There was a video the other day of a Russian propagandist asking some guy in Kherson whether they supported this guy: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman\_Shukhevych](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Shukhevych), and he repeatedly praised him as a hero.

However, if there is a 3rd (or 4th?) bridge I absolutely wouldn't be surprised if it was also already taken out.... they're rather easy to sink with an artillery barrage.... and all the bridging points identified so far are both easily discoverable by drone, and within range of literally dozens, if not hundreds, of UA tubes.

[],False,,-TheGreasyPole-,,,,,,"While I'd tend to agree with you (they should be trained on these, and I hope a covert programme was put in place very early in the war) there may be other issues with the M1's that I've become aware of.

I think we all know they are fuel hogs, and Ukraine does appear to increasingly have problems bringing enough fuel in by land and/or storing it with ru attacks on fuel infrastructure.

However, there may also be something more structural left over from the old USSR days. I read an article the other day which indicated Ukraine may have a LOT of trouble deploying M1's due to the fact that its criss-crossed by rivers.

The M1 is a *lot* heavier than the russian family of tanks (T-72 family, and T-64/80 family) being 70 tons rather than 50 tons fully loaded. The USSR was well aware of that. As a result a lot of the small bridges in Ex-USSR territory are built so that it can carry a T-72/T-80, but not an M1 (e.g. designing the bridge to take a 60 ton max weight). Even the larger bridges are built such that T-72s/T-80s can cross in double columns under weight limits and M1's only in single column.... and (the article didn't say this, but we can surmise) that some of the railways passing under road bridges/through tunnels may also have similar issues (being designed for a rail carried T-72/T-80 as the largest vehicle that can fit through it, and an M1 may not fit).

[T-72/M1 size comparison](https://imgur.com/WdVAkM9)

In addition, the bridging equipment UA has.... is all built for russian sized equipment, with the largest weight units being those T-72s/T-80s and so this is all rated to take 50 ton vehicles, but not 70 ton vehicles, too.

As a result, and in addition to the fuel issue, Ukraine might have real trouble actually moving M1's around Ukraine. The small bridges may not reliably carry them, they may not fit through the rail tunnels and bridges, and they won't fit on their current stocks of bridging equipment.

This might be part of the reason that the US/NATO has been so reluctant to go down this path.",1e75928f05c9409b0ca75d785a9517b73ce42c30,True,False,,,,,0,1652124326,,0,{},i7ygx31,False,t3_ulpliz,False,True,t1_i7ybgz1,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ulpliz/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_09_2022/i7ygx31/,1652124340,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652095526.0,[],text,t2_32z1q9wi,False,False

[],False,,evo_help93,,,,,,"Let me break down my thoughts into two key areas.

**1. Flaws with data gathering**

This is something we should *always* keep in mind when looking at OSINT: not all data is created equal or observed equally. This has been discussed at length elsewhere, but it's *likely* that Russian losses are captured at a higher rate than Ukrainian by OSINT. A great example of this is the Russian missile strikes - we have no idea what their efficacy is and what losses they've inflicted on the Ukrainians. I've heard a host of things on this particular issue (lack of accuracy, high failure rate, high shootdown rate, etc.) but I haven't seen any real evidence. We also know that Ukraine is not going to disclose losses (for obvious reasons) and Ukrainian civilians are highly unlikely to record and share. 

This is just one example, but similar lessons apply to the whole conflict. In general, the process of information gathering (civilian / mil cellphone recordings for example) heavily impacts the data itself (input / output problems). 

I won't speak to the size and scope of the error bars on this particular dataset, but it's simple enough to say that twitter is not real life and OSINT is highly unlikely to have a 1:1 correlation to real data.

**2. Flaws with data interpretation**

So even if we ignore everything outlined above, we still have to ask ourselves if the data we are gathering gives us *useful information* about the outcome we are trying to predict (or problem we are trying to solve). This is something I see time and time again in a host of areas that can be difficult to explain (or maybe I'm just a bad teacher) but I often ask: what does *GDP* really tell us about local development? Do GDP trends allow us to predict the potential success of a business venture or a desalination project in sub-saharan africa? What about GDP / capita? What about interest rates or a current account surplus?   


Extrapolating from the macro to the micro is *extremely difficult* because the macro often gives us little insight into the micro particularly when outcomes are not determined by homogenous trends. What do I mean by this? Let's take military losses for example: where and when those losses are inflicted often matter *much* more than the overall loss rate itself. Accounts of famous battles will often give you neat little examples of ""the one machine gun nest that saved the position"" or ""the single strand of barbed wire that stopped the attack"" (see: Ian W Toll's fantastic account of Guadalcanal) or ""the one bulldozer that kept the airfield operational."" These showcase how certain types of losses could have marginal impacts, while others could have been devastating.   


And yes while these accounts are often romanticized and surely fantastic, there is a grain of truth in them. After all, wars do not end when you rack up kills until a % rate is achieved and then everyone packs up and goes home (sorry McNamara). So even if we take the 3.5 ratio at face value, it doesn't really tell us all *that* much. It tells us the Russians are taking losses, and we have some other pieces of evidence that suggest those losses are concentrated into their best units, and that suggests that Russian ability to conduct major offensives will decline (all of which we have seen) but it doesn't give us a firm handle on answering questions like ""who will control village x"" or ""when will Ukraine push the russians to the border at Kharkiv,"" and so on and so forth.

&gt;The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense says that Russian forces are trying to develop their offensive in the Luhansk region with ""continuous attempts"" to cross the Siverskyi Donets river near Belahorivka.

&gt;Col. Oleksandr Motuzyanyk, the spokesperson for the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, said the Russians had built three pontoon crossings across the river and were supporting ground troops with artillery and aircraft.

&gt;He said the Russians were aiming to cut off Lysychansk, a town on the frontlines some ten miles (about 16 kilometers) from one of the pontoon bridges identified on satellite imagery.

&gt;If successful, the Russian advance might be able to cut Ukrainian supply lines to the defenders of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk.

&gt;But images reviewed by CNN indicate that at least one pontoon bridge has already been destroyed, with ruined tanks and other equipment half-submerged in the river.

&gt;""After the clean-up of Belohorivka, evacuation will resume,"" he added, saying rescuers would be able to clear the rubble of the school building that was hit on Saturday by a bomb dropped by a Russian aircraft, killing dozens of people taking refuge in the school.

&gt;It's unclear whether the Ukrainians retain control of Belohorivka.

1. Current US aid from beginning of invasion until now amounts to $4 billion.
2. Current appraisal of Ukrainian-Russian war is that it will continue for prolonged period of time.  Estimates of ""years"" are common.  With that in mind, concerns about lead time to train Ukrainian troops are no longer valid.
3. Many of the priciest combat systems that US has supplied until now such as:
   1. Stingers
   2. Javelins
   3. Mi-17 helicopters
   4. M777 howitizers

are either unavailable entirely or have reached threshold where additional donations would compromise combat ability of US armed forces. EE NATO members still have some reserves which could be backfilled by US aid, however the cost of such reserves is unlikely to exceed several Billion USD.

5. New production of combat equipment for Ukrainian armed forces is unlikely to be substantial, due to lag time involved in such production.

[],False,,-TheGreasyPole-,,,,,,"&gt;Looks like Oryx numbers and Ukrainian reported numbers are diverging more and more. For tanks, Oryx used to be at ~70% of Ukrainian numbers, now it's like ~55%. This sort of makes sense as TDF and civilians are much more likely to take a selfie with a destroyed tank than professional soldiers.

Also makes sense in so far as most of the destroyed tanks now are in the Donbas campaign where UA hasn't taken much territory, and lost a little. No opportunity to take selfies with a tank if its still on an active front lines, or 2km behind them on the russian side. That cuts off one of the biggest sources for the Ru losses uploads.

&gt;No reason to expect any major Russia vs Ukraine bias in equipment loss data.

Oh, I think there is. UA is really tight on OpSec concerning their own losses.... and Ru forces don't seem as inclined to post selfies with UA equipment as UA are quick to post the Ru stuff.

Media reports seem about the same for both sides.... But it seems to me UA has a more drone footage/ATGM footage to release... and also releases more selfies (of Ru losses only).

I'm inclined to believe that Oryx might be capturing 50-70% of Ru losses.....but only 20-40% of UA losses. No science to that, just a general guesstimate based on what seems to be differential willingness to record images and *then upload them to a public forum*. Ru troops don't seem to be doing the latter as much, maybe through lack of mobiles, maybe through being less online generally, maybe through general lack of access to social media, maybe something else.

When you look through the images, almost every UA loss image has a Ru media watermark.... but only about half the UA stuff does. Its clear there is a ""personal upload to personal social media"" channel for images that is far, far, far larger on the UA side than the Ru side.

&gt;Oryx keeps getting challenged by tankies a lot, but these challenges get shot down really quickly.

Yeah, I agree.... But in so far as he can only challenge their attempt to say *you* preferentially count losses/misidentify UA stuff as Ru stuff. I think he's very good at not doing this and can show so when challenged.

However, he has no control over his inputs. If there is just a lower propensity to record and upload UA losses there isn't much he can do about that, and I think there is.

&gt;Anyway, I don't think we've ever had any war where &gt;50% of equipment losses get open source photo evidence in near real time. It's completely unprecedented.

I'd say we're probably getting above 50% on the Ru reported losses side, or at least we were back in the Kyiv capmpaign and its aftermath.... now is less sure due to Ru capturing real estate.

I think we're still below that on the UA reported losses side.",47faca2d496df3377a1201fcc53e6ea1b34c4da5,True,False,,,,,0,1652119150,,0,{},i7y49mk,False,t3_ulpliz,False,True,t1_i7xw7d0,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ulpliz/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_09_2022/i7y49mk/,1652119164,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652090350.0,[],text,t2_32z1q9wi,False,False

[],False,,likeAgoss,,,,,,"It seems like there are a number of issues that mean we can't draw direct lines from Russia's poor performance to how a fight in the Pacific would go.

The first is that Russian ISR has been absolutely atrocious throughout this entire fight, and that's allowed Ukraine to move in ways and to preserve assets that RoC/the US/Whoever just wouldn't be able to in a conflict.  And while it's impossible to say exactly how well these systems work within the PLA, China does spend a lot more time and puts a lot more focus into this area than Russia does.  

And in that vein, foreign intelligence agencies are far less embedded inside the PLA than they are in the Russian military, especially since China was able to roll up [large parts of the CIA's human intelligence network](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/20/world/asia/china-cia-spies-espionage.html), meaning the RoC will have a much harder time disrupting their plans and actions than Ukraine has been able to do with Russia.

And then there's the issue of PGM stocks. China's stockpile is orders of magnitude larger than Russia's at the start of war and it continues to grow. This gives the PLARF significantly more freedom to operate and gives them much greater weight in a conflict. 

So let's look at the confluence of all of these things. One of the things that has enabled Ukraine to push back Russia is the fact that they're still able to operate large amounts of heavy equipment.  This happened because Russian targeting information was largely outdated, because Ukraine was able to identify which vulnerable targets needed the highest priority to move or be defended, and because after the initial week or two of the war, Russia has largely exhausted their supply of PGMs capable of deep strike.  None of this will be true in a fight with China.

So the things that are really underpinning Ukraine's fight, and the things that will be crucial in the defense of Taiwan or a fight in the Pacific - air defenses, anti-ship missiles, artillery batteries, ammunition and fuel caches, C3 nodes, etc. - are things that will suffer far greater losses in a war against China. And the successes that Ukraine has had, in denying air supremacy, in destroying high-profile targets and high-ranking officials, and in disrupting supply lines, are likely to be successes that China's adversaries won't have. 


And even where this does article does try to draw direct parallels around the force organization, I think Russia's circumstances make comparisons less than helpful.  Russia's BTGs have been ineffective in large part because they started the war with a manpower shortage, which was exacerbated by the fact that many soldiers were conscripts that were supposed to largely stay away from the heaviest fighting.  It's less that the structure is flawed in some way and more that attempting maneuver warfare largely without infantry is a bad idea. 

I'm certain that the PLA has hidden flaws, but they're just not the flaws that have stymied Russia's efforts in Ukraine and I'd definitely hesitate before trying to apply lessons from Ukraine to anywhere in the Pacific",f030c50cd2a829883cc6e82eb1394e5e2277c5b5,True,False,,,,,0,1652117245,,0,{},i7xzjwu,False,t3_ulil93,False,True,t1_i7vpj2s,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ulil93/lessons_of_ukraine_raise_doubts_about_pla/i7xzjwu/,1652117259,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652088445.0,[],text,t2_5uoot,False,False

The United States has seen “anecdotal reports” that some Russian troops in Ukraine are not obeying orders, according to a senior US defence official.  
  
The US believes that Russian troops and “mid-grade officers at various levels, even up to the battalion level” are refusing to obey orders to move forward in the new Donbas offensive in Ukraine, the official said.  
  
These officials “have either refused to obey orders or are not obeying them with the same measure of alacrity that you would expect an officer to obey”, the US official said.  
  
Russian forces have struggled with widespread morale problems since its invasion of Ukraine, the official added.

No reason to expect any major Russia vs Ukraine bias in equipment loss data. Oryx keeps getting challenged by tankies a lot, but these challenges get shot down really quickly.

So if we accept 3.5:1 equipment loss ratio as our best guess, it would make sense that this ratio might be a bit better for Russia for personnel, as Ukrainian army is less mechanized, so it has more soldiers per heavy equipment. On the other hand, from all reports Ukrainians take far better care of their wounded than Russians, so it's also reasonable that fewer of Ukrainian casualties end up dead.

They too thought the invasion threat could be masked through regular exercises and made the miscalculation that support for ""closer ties"" was the equivalent of ""ok with occupation/reunification. "" Clearly this was not the case.

One thing that Ukraine demonstrated is that allied intelligence agencies can absolutely tell the difference between preparations for an exercise and an invasion. There are key differences in the logistical chains, and the further back any troops are stationed the more complex the logistical chain becomes to actually kick off the invasion.

&gt;As does everyone else - which is why exercises and wargaming happens. The US hasn't conducted a real one in decades either - doesn't mean we don't train to do it.

The US has been engaged in live fire combined arms operations outside of wargaming for decades. A major amphibious landing no, but China's military in its current form has literally zero field experience with massed combined arms operations under enemy fire. Wargames can only prepare you so much for the challenges it poses and that can arise in a fluid situation.

&gt;Minus the fact that the PRC has significant advantages in arms, technology, manpower, supply, etc. They can absorb mistakes a lot better than the ROC can. For instance, Taiwan has some of the oldest F-16s in the world (original A/Bs) with only part of their force recently getting upgraded to the V standard - China has an order of magnitude more, and more recent, fighters than Taiwan alone.

The exact comparison was be made with Russia and Ukraine prior to the war. Ultimately sound defensive tactics usually overcome these advantages.

Obviously the longer a PRC/ROC conflict goes on logistical challenges would be more acute for Taiwan, but so much would depend on the success of the initial thrust and establishing a beachhead it's difficult to game out.",c0c11d28edf083f8e62baa693a8e5dfdd2e83188,True,False,,,,,0,1652113753,,0,{},i7xqscs,False,t3_ulil93,False,True,t1_i7xfe3e,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ulil93/lessons_of_ukraine_raise_doubts_about_pla/i7xqscs/,1652113769,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652084953.0,[],text,t2_ir5jw,False,False

If all local reserves are already committed and Russia punches a whole in their line, nobody can stop it until reserves from a higher HQ are shifted there to either counterattack or else take up a defensive position in the interior. Larger breakthroughs can't occur until UA operational reserves are all committed, which they aren't (they can always transfer units currently counterattacking near Kharkiv, as well as send more forces from the interior).

This article is pretty well done, and although its focus is artificial intelligence, these lessons are applicable for any new technology. I am unsure if the culture of being risk adverse and wanting to always be a team player of the uniformed military is the best place to go after the latest potential technologies. Perhaps a civilian department of defense project could be funded that would strive to adopt the risk taking practices and acceptance of failure that has been so successful in Silicon Valley. This would allow risky programs to be pursued outside of the chain of command that needs to protect their budget and ensure that they have tools needed to accomplish their tasks in the near future. 

---------------

&gt; * Leading militaries often grow overconfident in their ability to win future wars, and there are signs that the U.S. Department of Defense could be falling victim to complacency. Although senior U.S. defense leaders have spent decades talking up the importance of emerging technologies, including AI and autonomous systems, action on the ground has been painfully slow. 

&gt; * For example, the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy joined forces starting in 2003 to create the X-45 and X-47A prototypes: semiautonomous, stealthy uncrewed aircraft capable of conducting surveillance and military strikes. But many military leaders viewed them as threats to the F-35 fighter jet, and the air force dropped out of the program. The navy then funded an even more impressive prototype, the X-47B, able to fly as precisely as human-piloted craft. But the navy, too, saw the prototypes as threats to crewed planes and eventually backed away, instead moving forward with an unarmed, uncrewed aircraft with far more limited capabilities.

&gt; * The United States’ slow action stands in stark contrast to the behavior of China, Washington’s most powerful geopolitical rival. Over the last few years, China has invested roughly the same amount as the United States has in AI research and development, but it is more aggressively integrating the technology into its military strategy, planning, and systems—potentially to defeat the United States in a future war.


&gt; * The Defense Department appears to be biased in favor of tried-and-true capabilities over new tools, and its pace of innovation has slowed: the time it takes to move new technology from the lab and to the battlefield went from roughly five years, on average, in the early 1960s to a decade or more today.

&gt; * Instead, the danger of AI stems from deploying algorithmic systems, both on and off the battlefield, in a manner that can lead to accidents, malfunctions, or even unintended escalation. Algorithms are designed to be fast and decisive, which can cause mistakes in situations that call for careful (if quick) consideration. For example, in 2003, an MIM-104 Patriot surface-to-air missile’s automated system misidentified a friendly aircraft as an adversary, and human operators did not correct it, leading to the death by friendly fire of a U.S. F-18 pilot. 

&gt; * As part of its overhaul, the Defense Department will also need to change its culture so that it is not, as Michèle Flournoy, former undersecretary of defense for policy, described it in these pages last year, too “risk averse.”

&gt; * Currently, department officials often slow-walk or avoid risky initiatives to avoid the reputational damage that accompanies failure, burying promising projects in the process. 

&gt; * Even unsuccessful investments can prove strategically useful. The Chinese military pays close attention to U.S. military capabilities and planning, allowing the United States to potentially disrupt Beijing’s own planning by selectively revealing prototypes, including ones that did not pan out. China might respond by chasing sometimes flawed U.S. systems, while being uncertain about what the United States will actually deploy or develop next. If the U.S. military wants to remain the world’s strongest, it must continue making its adversaries follow it around.

&gt; * As conventional warfare makes an unfortunate comeback, the United States will need to adapt and restructure its military for the future—rather than resting on its laurels.

[],False,,FoxThreeForDale,,,,,,"&gt; The fact that the naval crossing is ""just"" 81 miles is actually a huge deal. The preparations alone required for it would give Taiwan ample time to ready themselves. 

And what would give Taiwan tipper that this is not just one of the numerous naval exercises that China does every year?

China alone has something like half a million forces within a days rail ride to ports on its west coast.

Let me ask you this: how many air bases are within non-AR range of Taiwan from the mainland?

&gt; A large scale naval landing is the type of complex combined arms operation even top tier militaries can struggle with, and China lacks practical experience with them.

As does everyone else - which is why exercises and wargaming happens. The US hasn't conducted a real one in decades either - doesn't mean we don't train to do it.

&gt;In short, the difficulty really can't be understated. The margin of error for PRC forces in the event of such an invasion is actually much smaller than it is for ROC, they're the ones that can't afford to make any mistakes.

Minus the fact that the PRC has significant advantages in arms, technology, manpower, supply, etc. They can absorb mistakes a lot better than the ROC can.

You think all the talk of having a massive A2/AD system is only going to be useful against warships? 


&gt;As for the training and morale issues, I think it's a mistake to assume those would be static. ROC has been watching Ukraine as well and it's almost certainly destroyed any sense of complacency that might have existed prior. Ukrainian successes in the face of overwhelming odds ought to dispell the notion to the defenders that fighting would be a lost cause.

Yes - but Ukraine is being backed economically and logistically by the US and NATO. What happens if no resupply ships can make it to Taiwan's ports after a blockade?

Likewise, Ukraine was invaded 8 years ago - that stirred up 8 years of nationalist identity. Meanwhile, the KMT has large parts of it which are/were pro-reunification.

Very good analysis, though you are a little bit shallow on the Stans.

Those definitely are more diverse than your umbrella statement. 

Tajikistan is highly dependent on Russia, half their income (or so) comes from guest workers inside of Russia, it is their main way of income. There are more than 3 million Tajik citizens who were officially registered in Russia in 2021, that's 35% of their population, a huge factor. Also, 8% of the population are ethnic Russians, the middle class of the country. 

Uzbekistan is trying to emulate Kazakhstan in terms of applying a more independent approach, though that strategy is not yet as far developed in Tashkent as in Astana. However, Uzbekistan is making a lot of effort to increase tourism (Tamerlan, Samerkand) and promote their liberal branch of Islam globally with some success. 

Kyrgyzstan is similar to Tajikistan in many ways, with the important difference that there are two million ethnic Russians in the Kyrgyz Republic. Bishkek is still largely under Moscow control, more so than the other Stans. 

Turkmenistan is China's top energy supplier (little known but crazy important fact), so that is that. Though Russia is still important obviously.

Apart from that, Mongolia is trying to use its good Russia relations for protection from China, I would say Ulan Bator follows a 50/50 approach. 

North Korea certainly sees Russia as its #2 bff.

Azerbaijan doesn't give a shit about anything, EU, US, China, Turkey, Russia, Aliyev will have good relations with anyone as long as he is left alone. Don't know about your Artsakh theory though, Baku agreed to those 2000 Russian troops.

The culture of the PLA is more similar to the insubordinate, decentralized environment of the wartime German and Japanese armies than it is to the Russian - the force is probably the most decentralized among major country armies today, with even training and doctrine being decided at the brigade level. Moreover,  the idea that Ukraine raises doubts about anyone's ""modernization"" is contradictory since it was arguably the more ""modern"" and better equipped force that got thrashed. 

This author makes the same mistake as a lot of authors in seeing ""political education"" as Communist indoctrination. Virtually nobody in China, including in the PLA, is a true believer in Communism. ""Political education"" in the modern PLA consists mainly of nighttime dad history lectures by the unit commissar about some wartime hero or battle after a long day of training. His comment below is basically nonsensical:

&gt; Devoting such energy to political education hints at the insecurity President Xi Jinping feels about the ideological purity of the armed forces, and by implication, their will to fight in an actual conflict.

Even if PLA soldiers were true Communists, they wouldn't be fighting Taiwan, America, or anyone else ""for Communism"".

Generals killed in Ukraine include those of the deputy commander and chief-of-staff grade, which is the **grade that exercises joint operations coordination duties in the PLA** (China Brief, October 5, 2012). **A brigade or division-sized unit may have only three or four officers of sufficient rank to perform these critical duties**. If PLA units in wartime suffered such attrition among command staff, despite the increasing reliance on automation and information networks, such losses might result in retaining the technical means for joint coordination, but lacking the authorities to effectively task and respond to joint requirements.

This paragraph doesn't seem to match what PLA are saying themself. In theory, joint operations are supposed to be conducted at the battalion level. PLA has openly acknowledged that some of the battalion level commanders are having trouble adjusting to having more command responsibility. But I would imagine the problems would get solved in time with more training.

This paragraph has always bothered me and I just realised why. It is using outdated sources. The source it is citing is from 2012 about the PLAN aircraft carriers. I have no idea why it was cited. I am guessing the author is using it as a source for the PLA grade system, but it's a very poor source, not very relevant to the discussion at hand. Maybe the author is his old article to pad his citation count.

The article's endnote has 8 sources, 5 of which are before 2010 and the other 3 before 2017. There are a few inline citations that is more recent.  Ten years+ old sources don't reflect the current state of PLA, especially post 2017 reform.

So are its ports where it imports food and supplies.

There is no overland route to bring arms and goods in - anyone coming to aid Taiwan is going to have to cover hundreds of miles of exposed water.

People act as if this is some massive distance China has to cover - the narrowest part of the Taiwan Straits is only 81 miles. A PLAAF fighter can takeoff, conduct a strike, RTB, re-load without re-fueling, and go back up again - and probably do it another time before having to refuel.

* Kazakhstan and most other Russia-friendly states aren't under Russian control, and already try to balance relations with Russia, as well as with China and the West; their policy is universally to balance between these regional powers as they cannot afford to be openly hostile to any of them
* Moldova has no army, not a chance to take back their land by force unless third party intervenes
* Georgia has very weak army, and Russia-occupied lands are next door
* Russia is 20% non-Russians, but the only place that could be a viable independent state is Chechnya, which is safe vassal state; everything else is some combination of too tiny (&lt;1mln people), way too many ethnic Russians, too low % of dominant ethnic group, or landlocked by Russian-majority regions from every direction.

Separation by sea is certainly important, but two factors:

* That mountainous terrain also hurts Taiwan - their major ports are all on the west side of the island, as are their air bases.
* The separation by sea is only 81 miles at its narrowest. You can pull out at 5am and be on the other side before noon. 
* On the other hand, Taiwan is hundreds of miles away from the nearest piece of land that can host US forces - and that is all over open water.

&gt;The WSJ cited other Taiwanese soldiers as saying they are worried about the quality of training and combat readiness. One of them said he had nothing to do during basic training and simply watched American war movies.

[],False,,MarshalWillKane,,,,,,"&gt; * In 2020, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed formed a coalition to end the dominance of the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) – the former ruling party – forever.

&gt; * In the wake of a contested election in Tigray, Abiy kicked off a military operation in November 2020, ostensibly to restore constitutional order. His law and order campaign was supposed to conclude in a few weeks, but has since morphed into a civil war.

&gt; * The initial phase of Abiy’s war against the TPLF went as planned. Within three weeks, government coalition forces captured Mekelle, the Tigrayan capital, with support from the Eritrean Defence Forces in the north. 

&gt; * Tigrayan forces quickly regrouped, bolstered by popular support. Battle-tested military leaders, intellectuals, youth, peasants and professionals joined the fight. Over the following seven months, they routed Africa’s two largest armies, those of Ethiopia and Eritrea, evicting them from most of Tigray and reclaiming Mekelle. 

&gt; * A southward advance toward the capital brought it to within 140 km of Addis Ababa, causing administrative chaos in the city. Officials of the Somali and Amhara regions diverted funds, fearing state collapse. But the advance was halted by a renewed ENDF campaign, bolstered this time by militia forces and Chinese, Iranian and Turkish drones.

&gt; * The TDF retreated to its state boundaries. Abiy’s federal government resorted to starvation tactics, imposing a blockade on Tigray that denying all but token amounts of humanitarian assistance.

&gt; * A recent study by Ghent University reported more than half a million deaths in Tigray due to the conflict

&gt; * Tigray, in contrast, is resource-poor, despite its internal cohesion and will to fight.

&gt; * In March 2022, Abiy’s government announced a ‘Unilateral Humanitarian Truce’ with Tigray, which the Tigray regional government reciprocated, but without enthusiasm. It assumed the truce was a public relations tactic designed to placate foreign critics. 

&gt; * …if severe diplomatic pressure is not exerted in short order to get the parties talking (a forced peace), renewed hostilities are to be expected, perhaps within weeks.

&gt; * The number of Ethiopians who have paid the ultimate price for miscalculations by the TPLF and Abiy governments may already number in the hundreds of thousands. 

&gt; * It is still not too late to incentivise the parties to negotiate; the question is whether major powers have the will and political resources to do so.

&gt; * Whether the route to negotiations is long and bloody, and whether outsiders play a supporting or neglectful role, are the major questions. However, at some point, Ethiopians will need to come to the table and forge a new political settlement in whatever remains of their country

My comments:

This war has taken wild swings in favor of one side and then the other in ways that I cannot remember seeing before in a civil war. It is a strange ride to read the major events of the war and remember that it has all taken place in the same conflict in a short amount of time. 

The amount of human suffering is immense as well. We have talked about the high casualties from a higher intensity conflict before in regards to Ukraine. But the numbers of deaths in this war are far greater than what the Ukraine war has seen. And I suspect that much of this is due to the ethnic animosity, poverty, and the swings of success I mentioned before. All of which lead to much greater civilian death and suffering. 

If there is a bright spot it, the author does seem hopeful that international pressure can force the weakened central government to accept a truce and allow in aid to those who need it. It just depends if the world can walk and chew gum at the same time when pushing for peace.",494774bdc0d5ffcf101fd6d8a178a4c21cb8d3a3,True,False,,,,,0,1652103430,,0,{},i7x1xg5,True,t3_ulr87c,False,True,t3_ulr87c,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ulr87c/ethiopia_an_allout_war_looks_imminent_while/i7x1xg5/,1652103444,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652074630.0,[],text,t2_dla6h,False,False

[],False,,-TheGreasyPole-,,,,,,"&gt;Not at all, for starters all of these cities are much larger than Severdonetzk

Not really. Sumy's 265k and Chernihivs 285k ... The Sverodonetsk+Lysychansk (S/L) connorbation is 205k. Thats the area they're trying to cut off.

Its a little smaller but not a huge amount.

&gt;the Russians had much smaller forces compared to their size in theater

Here, perhaps. They're focussing forces here in a way that they were split between multiple cities before.... so even with attrition I'd expect it is a larger concentration of force.

Accoring to that ""BTG map by front"" we're talking 26 BTGs. A little larger than the concentration they had at Izyium, and it may be reinforced further if they pull back from there. 

OTOH, its unclear how many of them will be left after all the Sverodonetsk, Popansa, Bilohoriwka assaults recently AND whatever more they'd have to do to complete the encirclement.

Its possible there may be considerable less than 26 BTGs by the time they close the circle.

&gt;Those cities were also under much better Ukrainian AA, so no Russian CAS was possible. 

Again, I'm not sure how true that was for Sumy/Chernihiv (although I concede it was true for Kyiv/Kharkiv). 

I don't know what AA they have in Sverodonetsk, but again its the last part of the closed circle (the line between S/L and Slovyansk/Kramatorsk) thats the issue. That can be covered by AA in the Slovyansk/Kramatorsk areas as well as any situated in S/L.

If they complete that encirclement they are no longer just ""nibbling along the borders"" in the way they are at Popansa and Sverodonetsk at the moment... If you're talking CAS of the encircling forces they have to come into that area between S/L and S/K where the circle would have to be closed. Thats the weak link where you can expect to be attacked from both directions, either on land or in the air.

The encirclement at Mariupol was never at risk, despite the heroic efforts within that encirclement. They just simply never had to worry about a UA attack in the rear.

Any encirclement of the S/L connorbation has to deal with having 2 fronts along a 40-50km section of the perimeter, and potentially being severed at multiple points along that double front. 

I'm not sure its going to be possible for them to ""hunker down for a long seige starving their ammo and food supply until they fall"" in the same way they could at Mariupol, or they attempted (but failed) to do at Chernihiv and Sumy. 

Breakthroughs may happen regularly, in either direction and whilst Sverodonetsk may not be able to ""hold out all alone for 3 months"" as Mariupol has.... it may be able to hold for days, or weeks, for a relieving attack..... and then potentially for a month or more if multiple relieving attacks are temporarily successful at different points.

I'm not sure, absent big wins elsewhere (like Slovyansk and Kramatorsk falling), that Sverodonetsk would be put in the position that Mariupol has been of attempting to hold out with no prospect of breaking out/in.

Its probably correct to say that ""S/L couldn't hold out for nearly as long as Mariupol if it *had to do it the way Mariupol has had to do it*"". But it is possible to see how it could hold out for a very long time, if it is not put in the same situation Mariupol has been because the encirclement is never as solid and impermeable.",4948c415d65c98ef0eb3bd0fce7608668b51242c,True,False,,,,,0,1652101893,,0,{},i7wyqeb,False,t3_ul07ek,False,True,t1_i7wsuf3,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ul07ek/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_08_2022/i7wyqeb/,1652101906,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652073093.0,[],text,t2_32z1q9wi,False,False

It's only going to get more expensive if the teams switch sides and now Ukraine is on the offensive against Russian-held territory.

[],False,,RobotWantsKitty,,,,,,"&gt; The earliest use of the Z in an online flash mob in support of the Russian Army that Meduza was able to find is from before the official start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Meduza learned about the incident from the political strategist Igor Mangushev, who runs the Telegram channel “Notes of an Adventurer” (the name of which now also features the Z) and who identifies as a “retired captain of the Luhansk People’s Republic.” 
&gt; 
&gt; Mangushev’s name appeared in a leak about the Internet Research Agency, the St. Petersburg-based troll farm thought to be associated with Evgeny Prigozhin. Mangushev confirmed the veracity of these messages in an interview with the news outlet Fontanka. In 2019, the newspaper Novaya Gazeta named Mangushev as one of the provocateurs who organized an alleged false flag campaign to stuff bogus signatures onto a petition supporting the candidacy of Lyubov Sobol, a close associate of Alexey Navalny, in her run for a seat on Moscow’s City Duma. (The aim was to undermine the credibility of Sobol’s support.)
&gt; 
&gt; Igor Mangushev told Meduza that the idea for the flash mob was his and his “associates,” whom he describes as “people in creative professions who started taking up arms in 2014 in light of a certain set of circumstances.” To confirm his statements, Mangushev showed Meduza screenshots of Telegram messages with people discussing incorporating Z logos into their profile pictures that also “look like brushstrokes of white paint, a little sloppy but still identical.” 
&gt; 
&gt; These images really did begin to appear in a number of Telegram channels that focused on supporting the self-declared “national republics” in eastern Ukraine around February 20 and 21, that is, on the eve of the invasion. According to Mangushev, that’s how “people involved in creating state propaganda must have seen it and thought, ‘Oh cool, let’s use this.’” 
&gt; 
&gt; But Mangushev makes no claim to the symbol’s “copyright”: “We did something important and useful, and we’re happy that people adopted it. For many reasons, we don’t have the government resources at our disposal to make it go truly national ourselves. We’re not like RT — we can’t print a million T-shirts and sell them.” 
&gt; 
&gt; At the same time, Mangushev does not approve of the way the government is “pushing Z” as the official symbol of the “special operation.” He told Meduza that he likes the totalitarian aesthetic of the student rally with the Z’s and the Sieg Heiling, but he says he’d make adding the symbol to profile pictures and wearing Z merch completely voluntary. 
&gt; 
&gt; “For it to be truly popular, it has to come from the heart. Unfortunately, our state doesn’t know how to make things come from the heart,” Mangushev concluded.

\-A shift towards shock and awe in the opening phase of the operation, minimising collateral damage would firmly become a secondary/tertiary concern. No longer would the hope be place on the opposition simply melting away or the collaborate.  
\-Communication infrastructure will become key target, cutting the internet would be given priority in order to erode moral and delay outside response.  
\-Reaffirmation in the value of drones, I personally believe UCAVs will be a game changer and the PRC will lean heavily into its drone manufacturing capabilities.  
  
The idea of initaiting a limited conflict to ""test the waters""would be very ill-advised for the PRC, it will prepare the defender alot more than attacker as it shakes the defender out of its sense of complacency.  
Also, anyone who paid any attention of cross starits relation would know the idea of PRC seizing ROC's offshore island without going for Taiwan as well is ludicrous. It is in PRC's political interest to see islands like Kinmen and Penghu remain part of ROC as it strengthens ROC's connection to the mainland and prevent the DPP from pretending that Taiwan has nothing to do with the mainland.  
  
The capability gap between PRC and ROC is enormous, it is insufficient for the latter to hold off the former just by doing everything right, the latter also have to do almost everything wrong.

It may be popular to parrot this take but that doesn't mean it's correct. A (not yet peer reviewed) [study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.22.22272769v1#:~:text=Two%20doses%20of%20either%20vaccine,%3A%2067.8%25%2C%2079.2%25) from Hong Kong found that 

&gt;&gt;Two doses of either vaccine protected against severe disease and death, with higher effectiveness among adults ≥60 years with BNT162b2 (VE: 88.2%, 95% confidence interval, CI: 84.4%, 91.1%) compared to CoronaVac (VE: 74.1%, 95% CI: 67.8%, 79.2%). Three doses of either vaccine offered very high levels of protection against severe outcomes (VE: 98.1%, 95% CI: 97.1%, 98.8%).

Which suggests that Sinovac/Coronavac lags behind BioNTech/Pfizer at 2 doses for preventing serious cases/death, but gets very close at 3 doses. 

So the issue here is that it is *not* effective in preventing transmission/infection, it *is* effective at preventing death at 3 doses, and it is not *as* effective (but far from virtually non-existent) at 2 doses. The problem here is that the elderly population especially has lagged behind in getting 3 shots for full vaccination. You can skim through WHO documents on [Sinovac](https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-sinovac-covid-19-vaccine-what-you-need-to-know) and [Sinopharm](https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-sinopharm-covid-19-vaccine-what-you-need-to-know) if you want to read a bit more.

The USA had logistical challenges too when COVID necessitated restrictions and lockdowns. The entire shipping industry has gotten fucked up from COVID. I'm not here to argue about how robust the logistical system for Shanghai (a major trade hub, a major port, a city of 26 million people) are.

&gt; but Shanghai is not a good look for Chinese logistics atm

A lot of this genuinely isn't because China is incapable of handling logistics, because to suggest so would be utterly foolish considering people can and will order anything from house appliances to fresh groceries to a housecleaner through their phone and they're building/have built an enormous network of highways and roads and rail, with the vehicles and the people required to serve it. 

The logistical fuckup of Shanghai has more to do with the aboslute idiocy required from the political upper echelons that decided to kneecap logistics by preventing literal millions of drivers and deliverypeople from either entering Shanghai or going around Shanghai. Shanghai has like 26 million people, it *needs* these people for the normal logistics to happen. The continued fuckups and their flipflopping of relaxing and then tightening measures isn't incompetency with logistical capability, its incompetency in politics. 

This isn't unknown to people in China and in Shanghai either. We've went from same day delivery with dozens of food delivery options to stores being closed and our Taobao/Tmall/Alibaba orders being held at their warehouses because they just can't get driven here. There are literally lines of trucks on my way to work near Shanghai where trucks have to change drivers, because the drivers from outside the city aren't allowed to drive the trucks to their destination *inside* the city, so someone else has to finish the last leg of the haul.

Just because they were both once a soviet-style military doesn't mean PLA reforms might be 'riddled with weaknesses and faults'. Besides the PLA was still different from the soviet military as well.

&gt;Even as PLA exercise directors have imposed more complex exercise conditions on units, the scope of decision-making power for individual commanders remains limited and coordination with other units still depends on upper-echelon authorities.

Pretty sure this is not the case, the reforms should have put more power in the hands of commanders. 

&gt;Russia’s loss of so many generals also exposes a particular weakness of the PLA’s own joint command model.

We can't just assume the PLA would lose as many generals as Russia did in any conflict (not to mention, there have been cases of claimed dead generals/commanders that later then showed up alive and well.). 

&gt;Devoting such energy to political education hints at the insecurity President Xi Jinping feels about the ideological purity of the armed forces, and by implication, their will to fight in an actual conflict. 

This is assuming a lot that we don't know. 

&gt;CCP must recognize as a military lacking in ideological quality.

The PLA lacking ideological quality??? Lol no. 

&gt;…while these setbacks observed from afar might delay a full-scale amphibious invasion of Taiwan, they might also prompt PLA leadership to accelerate the timetable for a smaller scale conflict.

Why? Ukraine was pitiful in 2014, and because of Donbass/Crimea they put a lot more money in their military. 

&gt;This raises the stakes for deterrence forces in theater and underscores the imperative to improve the indigenous capabilities of the Taiwanese armed forces.

The latest corruption perception index (which I admit is imperfect as it's based on perception) ranks China at 66th out of 180, Russia at 136th, and Ukraine at 122th, with a higher rank being better. Going by this, Russia and Ukraine are relatively similar while China is ahead of both. To be clear, I do agree that corruption is definitely a factor, but this leaves out the lack of funds to maintain the gargantuan remains of the Soviet military that Russia struggled with and a long list of other potential factors. I'm sure that as time goes on and more research and scholarship comes out, we'll probably get a clearer picture of what exactly happened and why. However, I think, especially with this being a relatively recent and still ongoing event, it's premature to assume one singular cause.

Also, it's probably not very smart to assume that the status of the Russian and Chinese military are the same given the different trajectories that the former and latter have taken since the end of the Cold War.

[],False,,poincares_cook,,,,,,"While tactically the IDF under performed, strategically Lebanon 2006 was a huge success in retrospect. The war ended 6 years of weekly Hezbollah cross border attacks in the form of rocket and mortar shelling, sniper fire, ATGM and RPG strikes, and cross border raids such as the one that started the war. Deterrence was achieved. I don't know what metrics must one use to call it a disaster, the IDF has lost about 4-7 times less personnel, while it was stalled on some axis, it has advanced on others and **all** Hezbollah counter attacks failed. Israel underperformed, but Hezbollah wasn't really powerful enough to exploit that to make any strategic difference. 

&gt;far too eager to come with all kinds of excuses.

Reasons are not excuses, the subject is well studied and a lot of the failures of the IDF were made public by the Israeli post war examining commissions. When things go wrong they happed for a reason. Which of these main points do you consider excuses:

1. Lack of training, before the 2006 war, Israel has sacrificed training across the board both in regular and reserve units and instead deployed the units to the WB and Gaza to deal with the second intifada. Specialized forces (artillery, armor, combat engineers etc) were diverted and used as light infantry in the WB. some units have not *seen* their tank/SPA for more than 6 months and up to a year before the war started, had a 1-2 week refresher and thrown in.
2. Confused political leadership, unclear and ever shifting goals. A great example of this was the battle of Bint Jbel, initially a force of 5k was assigned a 3 pronged plan of capturing the town, during the day before the night time operation was launched plans have shifted for one reason or another and incrementally the scale of the attack was downgraded. By the time the operation was launched it has changed to much that **only a force of 200** conducted a limited attack.
3. Tied to #2, the scale of force used for much of the war was way way too small. Ties in with unclear political objectives and no will to commit to what was then known as an operation. Israel allowed itself to get incrementally dragged in. At first only a force of 2000 entered Lebanon, then over a two weeks it was increased to 10k, and ramped up to \~30k in the last 3-4 days of the war. It's quite obvious that a 10k force is not large enough for a significant operation against a *highly* entrenched enemy in mountainous-urban terrain, let alone a force of 2k. In comparison 60k soldiers and 800 tanks crossed into Lebanon on the first day of the 1982 Lebanon war.

&gt;All the recent Israeli interventions (Lebanon and however many Gaza interventions it's been by now) failed to achieve any decisive outcomes.

None of them set such a goal, though Lebanon 2006 did end up reaching a relatively decisive outcome despite that. 

&gt;Israel at best basically just kicks the can down the road a few years.

As stupid as it sounds that's the policy. It makes some sense in the short term. The economical and geopolitical fallouts from a decisive action in Gaza would be tremendous, Israel chooses to have these operations and suffer some rocket strikes once every few years instead of suffering the international Hague prosecutions and likely sanctions that would follow anything that could root out Hamas and Islamic Jihad from among the Palestinians. An operation that would be similar to the battles against ISIS in Raqqa/Mosul, only among a much denser civilian population with an order of magnitude higher civilian losses.

&gt;Over the last 20+ years, Israeli wall construction workers did more to Israeli security than everything IDF did.  


The wall with the WB does very little in terms of security, it's porous where it exists and is completely void from much of the border. Palestinians are able to cross effortlessly and at will, tens of thousands do every day to work illegally in Israel. No offense, but this point indicates you lack any in depth understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian security situation. The wall with Gaza does more, but only because it's heavily manned and monitored, including by air assets. The only ""wall"" that does provide huge security benefits on it's own is the anti tunneling underground obstacle around Gaza.

&gt;Now it's unclear what IDF could actually do destroy Hamas or Hezbollah short of turning Gaza into Mariupol.

Yes, Mariupol, Mosul, Raqqa.

[],False,,bleepblopbloopy,,,,,,"&gt; * Like all modern militaries, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is fundamentally a learning organization. Militaries must learn, adapt, and teach tactics and doctrine in a constant cycle.

&gt; * China’s military modernization and doctrinal reform have been largely informed by U.S. campaigns, which PLA observers have carefully parsed, including the Iraq, Afghanistan and Kosovo wars.

&gt; * Now in the shadow of a Russian invasion of Ukraine that has seen a large and similarly reformed Soviet-style military largely fail to attain its primary objectives, the PLA must face the possibility that its own reforms are riddled with hidden weaknesses and fundamental faults.

&gt; * PLA reforms have transformed an army once incapable of effectively coordinating ground fires in the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese War to an inter-service joint warfighting force. 

&gt; * The restructuring of PLA brigade and division units has been a hallmark of PRC military modernization, including the creation of “combined battalions” (合成营, hecheng ying) and “combined brigades” (合成旅, hecheng lü), for conducting combined arms operations (81.cn, March 20, 2020). These restructured units are similar to Russia’s battalion tactical groups (BTGs)…

&gt; * In contrast to Russia, opposing forces exercises have become the norm in annual examination exercises for PLA ground forces and the PLA has expanded its non-commissioned officer (NCO) corps. [4]

&gt; * Even as PLA exercise directors have imposed more complex exercise conditions on units, the scope of decision-making power for individual commanders remains limited and coordination with other units still depends on upper-echelon authorities.

&gt; * Russia’s loss of so many generals also exposes a particular weakness of the PLA’s own joint command model. Generals killed in Ukraine include those of the deputy commander and chief-of-staff grade, which is the grade that exercises joint operations coordination duties in the PLA (China Brief, October 5, 2012). A brigade or division-sized unit may have only three or four officers of sufficient rank to perform these critical duties. If PLA units in wartime suffered such attrition among command staff, despite the increasing reliance on automation and information networks, such losses might result in retaining the technical means for joint coordination, but lacking the authorities to effectively task and respond to joint requirements.

&gt; * Similar research topics appear frequently in Chinese academic journals, suggesting that the potential for advanced electronic warfare capabilities is well appreciated within PLA circles. In a wartime situation, the PLA would likely expect the battlespace to become cluttered and confused due to undisclosed adversary capabilities.

&gt; * Devoting such energy to political education hints at the insecurity President Xi Jinping feels about the ideological purity of the armed forces, and by implication, their will to fight in an actual conflict. 

&gt; * Russian troops have shown pervasive morale and unit cohesion problems, which the CCP must recognize as a military lacking in ideological quality.

&gt; * …while these setbacks observed from afar might delay a full-scale amphibious invasion of Taiwan, they might also prompt PLA leadership to accelerate the timetable for a smaller scale conflict.

&gt;* In order to truly test the outcomes of their two decades of technical investments and structural reforms, the Central Military Commission may choose to launch an outlying island seizure, naval blockade, or other limited campaign that could be de-escalated quickly under China’s own concepts of “war control” (战争控制, zhanzheng kongzhi). [8]

&gt; * This raises the stakes for deterrence forces in theater and underscores the imperative to improve the indigenous capabilities of the Taiwanese armed forces. Indo-Pacific forces must be ready to respond to any attempts at military misadventures by another aging authoritarian nursing revanchist dreams of restored imperial glory.

[],False,,Konchitsya-Leto,,,,,,"That is a gross misrepresentation of Chinese history. For one, ""police state"" and ""expansionist, active foreign policy"" are not mutually exclusive. 

Imperial states that ruled the area of what is now known as ""China proper"" had major differences in foreign policy. The Han, Qin, and Tang dynasties were aggressively expansionist, subjugating and colonizing what is now known as Southeastern China, Gansu, and Xinjiang. Dynasties of outside origin, namely the Yuan and early Qing, also greatly expanded their territories through conquest, genocide, and clever diplomacy. Some states did adopt a more isolationist foreign policy, such as the late Ming and Qing, but these 16th-20th century states can hardly be considered representative of 2000+ years of history. 

In pop history historical dynasties are always depicted as being highly centralized, yet in reality emperors have always given local rulers a great deal of autonomy, especially in the hinterlands. The earliest dynasties, the Zhou and Han, had a feudal power structure, with the empire consisting of a patchwork of fiefdoms ruled by warrior nobility. The feudal structure slowly transformed, as the central government became more powerful in subsequent regimes, into a political system where tracts of the Empire's borderlands were assigned as semi-autonomous states ruled by hereditary military families. 

The early to mid Ming developed a strong Imperial government with a sort of proto-secret police (錦衣衞, ""Embroidered Uniform Guard""), however central authority degenerated and collapsed during the late Ming. The succeeding Qing dynasty a more adopted a decentralized state and military structure (which was one of the reasons why it could not compete with the other Great Powers of the time). The subsequent collapse of the Qing, as we all know, ushered in a 40 year long period of warlord states (Mainland ROC included) - the PRC is probably the first truly internally-integrated Chinese state to have emerged in the last 200 years.",27eb2b5b593c3cd0b1ab119b835dc95027a13cb5,True,False,,,,,0,1652067735,,0,{},i7vo7ec,False,t3_uj9sjw,False,True,t1_i7lxv8d,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uj9sjw/unrestricted_warfare_is_not_chinas_master_plan/i7vo7ec/,1652067749,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652038935.0,[],text,t2_id0sm922,False,False

[],False,,Kvetch__22,,,,,,"&gt; Popsana has been completely levelled and so ukraine has retreated, and situation 

Good to get some confirmation on what I was hoping was true, which is that withdrawal from Popansa was tactical and not forced. One thing that has been true since the start of the war is that UA command has been very good at picking and choosing their battles. They haven't been afraid to give up the land they can't defend.

I keep repeating this but it's an important point: although one of the main aims of the Russian offensive is to occupy the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk, that is a bit of a mirage. Even if they manage to complete that goal, they are going to have to force a political settlement, or else the UA is going to keep fighting and grind them down. The cost in machines, money and manpower to keep the war going is going to eventually necessitate either a Russian withdrawal or a peace agreement on Russia's terms. 

The takeaway from this is that, in order for Russia to actually win a political victory worth the cost, they need to destroy a significant part o the UA's manpower and put Ukraine in a position where they can no longer realistically continue the war effort. That is not going to happen if the UA keeps on making smart decisions to abandon indefensible locations and only make stands in good positions.

&gt;""very very complicated for Ukr"" in severodonetsk.

Associated with the above, the UA is going to face a real test soon about whether or not to abandon Severdonetsk. With Popansa occupied, the road to Bakhmut is open, and that's going to put supply routes to Severodonetsk in danger. So long as the Russians don't cross the Siverkyi Donnets at Liman the position should be secure, but if Russian offensive capability isn't exhausted soon, the UA position is going to look really sketchy. 

My question is whether the UA is going to abandon the city, or potentially let it get surrounded. The Russian cordon won't be airtight, and the Russians can't afford another Mauripol. I'd say it's possible that if Severdontsk gets encircled, the Russians just beat their faces on a brick wall until the UA can relieve the city. But obviously the risk there is huge. 

And because the UA has been so smart for three months now about when and where to fight, I expect they will probably abandon the city if they feel like they need to preserve the forces located there. I think that might be something to watch over the next few weeks.",a7e7816f3a618560342410f12028b4aa50c86815,True,False,,,,,0,1652065240,,0,{},i7vjt52,False,t3_ul07ek,False,True,t1_i7vbies,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ul07ek/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_08_2022/i7vjt52/,1652065251,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652036440.0,[],text,t2_wa50e,False,False

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,,,,"I'd agree the UAF took the importance of NCO's to heart but Brig Gen Hilbert is I think mistaken that the Ukrainian military had built an effective NCO corps by the time the war started. Important not to draw false lessons. Some observations... 1/13 

Just before the conflict Nick Reynolds and I had long interviews ranging from junior enlisted on the line of contact to the deputy chair of the national security and defence council about the structure, planning, and preparations of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. 2/13 

We haven't published a lot of the material because much of it could have been useful to the Russians just prior to the invasion. However, I heard very consistent messages on NCOs and junior leadership from all ranks. 3/13

While the UAF aspired to have a professional NCO corps it was very nascent. There was not a strong PME structure for their NCOs. Nor was the exact role of these personnel consistent across formations given a lack of institutional culture. 4/13 

Furthermore, before the conflict the UAF had significant retention problems, especially among enlisted personnel who had received specialist training, which included many junior NCOs. However... 5/13 

What the Ukrainians did have was a large body of older troops who had experienced fighting in 2014/2015 - and in some cases going back to Afghanistan - who were serving across all ranks. If you went to UAF units you would find 20 year olds and 40 years at the same rank. 6/13 

In addition, because of the retention problem, and therefore training more specialists than normal, there was a large body of experienced military personnel in civilian roles who could be mobilised. 7/13 

Another aspect to this was that commanders kept rollerdexes of old comrades with specialist skills in areas like signals and logs and when their unit was rotated into the JFO - for example - would call them up and issue short term contracts. 8/13 

So in many respects, roles that in a NATO military would be the preserve of a long service NCO were actually being filled by very motivated and experienced short-notice reservists (without said reservist being afflicted by stupid quantities of pointless paperwork). 9/13 

The result however is that UAF units have lots of very experienced troops serving next to and at the same rank as newly mobilised troops, and this is not concentrated in a few formations but actually distributed across a lot of the force. 10/13 

The UAF were enthusisatic about training provided by the US, UK and Canada (and it was a package at ascending echelons so the aid by these three countries can't really be separated out). But the Ukrainians entered this war at the beginning of reforming the force. 11/13 

There is a false narrative that UAF success is because of NATO training. NATO training helped. But in many ways the 'eight years' that Brig Gen Hilbert speaks of both shows how much impact training can have, and how much more could have been achieved. 12/13 

There is an interesting lesson here about avoiding self-replication when providing training. The Ukrainian model has proven successful, but resembles Finland's approach more than the US. NATO should be cautious about telling Finns about 'best practice' if it joins. 13/13

So does Russia. Right now, Ukraine is fighting them to a stale-mate in most places, winning in some, and tactically withdrawing after bleeding the Russians as much as possible in a few others. The Ukrainian army in 6 months will still be more competent than the Russian army in 6 months, but it will also probably be better equipped.

&gt;Their Regular Army don't have a deep well trained reserve

I'm not sure what you really mean by this, because Ukraine has had conscription and partial mobilization since Putin invaded back in 2014--from what I've seen, they had an estimated reserve of roughly 900,000 in February. With a lot of those probably having been in an active combat zone sometime in the past 8 years. They'll likely need at least a month or two of refresher training, but so will any of the inexperienced reserves that Russia pulls out of its ass.

&gt;the Territorial Defence Forces and various National Gaurd/Militias are not trained to NATO standards.

Not yet, at least. Again, time is not on Russia's side here. 

&gt;The heavy equipment they are getting is helpful, but will not be able to change the war around as it will be months before enough arrives and soldiers will be trained.

The war will still be going in a few months. The war doesn't end until both sides say the war ends--even if Russia somehow kicked the Ukrainian army completely out of the Donbas tomorrow, the war wouldn't be over.

Regardless, though, heavy equipment and the first wave of trained Ukrainians already started arriving back in Ukraine. The M777s for example have already arrived.

&gt;It's tempting to give Ukraine high tech flashy weapons like Abrams and F-15 but they aren't useful for months whilst you train pilots from scratch and mechanics. That's why the focus has been on ex soviet hardware.

That's why I said ""in 6 months"", and not ""tomorrow.""",e84156c1ca63a932fae6059d56542235e863e241,True,False,,,,,0,1652063888,,0,{},i7vh8be,False,t3_ukrhnr,False,True,t1_i7v5pv3,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ukrhnr/russias_manpower_conundrum_in_ukraine_russia_is/i7vh8be/,1652063903,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652035088.0,[],text,t2_hoiys,False,False

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,,,,"I don't think they have shifted objectives at all. From the start of the Siverskyi Donets/Severodonetsk Salient offensive, it was always done with four axes of advance, two from the top and bottom of the shoulders (Izyum and Popasna), one from the north towards Lyman, and one against the bulge itself at Severodonetsk and Lysychans'k, with the overall operational goals to either encircle/destroy UA forces in the salient or to drive them out of it, which would conquer all of Luhansk and most of Donetsk oblasts.   

From Izyum, the directions of attack seems to have been towards Slovyansk and then Bakhmut, with the other part of the double envelopment coming from Popasna in a reverse direction towards Bakhmut and then Slovyansk, both to unite on the M03/E40 road to seal the encirclement. The drive from Lyman seems to be a supporting effort for the Izyum direction, to both hold its place and capture important crossing point of the Donets. And the drive from Severodonetsk and Lysychans'k was concocted either as a holding attack to fix in place the UAF that were positioned there there so they couldn't respond to their flanks, or they too also wanted to head towards Bakhmut and Slovyansk. 

That obviously didn't work out as planed. 

The Izyum drive down the M03 road has largely failed to make much progress, which is understandable since it was such an obvious direction they'd try to advance from, plus the closest point from the UA interior lines. However, they did have some decent success on secondary axes that opened up especially to the southwest, that saw some the possibility to cut off the UA east-west supply lines heading to the salient. But they're not that effective at anything happening inside the salient to support other attacks, which is likely why they are now shifting forces from there to other sectors. 

The Russians have nearly made it to Lyman, and if they take that they might be able to cross the Donets there, though I doubt it. But having control of that area gives them a major intersection for the T0514 and T0513 roads, especially the latter that heads east that the Ukrainians are likely relying on to resupply units further to the east.

Crossing the Donets at Rubizhne to Severodonetsk wont have the ability to cut off UA forces but that sort of frontal assault does undermine the positions in the salient, which can either force UA to commit more reserves to defend it, or order them to retreat, which further collapses the salient. 

The drive from Popasna was the one that was not working at all since the start of the offensive, success now is likely either because they were either able to successfully weaken it by previous attacks and fires to cause the Ukrainians to fall back and abandon it, or else UA might have had to remove forces earlier to reinforce other sectors which caused it to weaken them to the point they couldn't hold it when the Russians launched a fresh and unexpected attack. Either is possible. 

So overall, the offensive seems to be going as originally planned, though much slower than they likely anticipated. They were attacking UA fixed defenses and hasty positions, so they had to know they'd suffer resistance, which is why they waited weeks to attack, why they massed so many forces, and why they massed so many supplies.",1462bc492620f37df140b98ae86d5020ed06d758,True,False,,,,,0,1652062737,,0,{},i7veyk4,False,t3_ukbt1m,False,True,t1_i7qsdst,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ukbt1m/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_07_2022/i7veyk4/,1652062753,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652033937.0,[],text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False

In western democracies the the strong is still taking from the weak. Big corporations abuse low-wage labourers, pay them a pitance then toss them out with little guarantee when it suits them. Western chemical giants pollute the environment, make entire populations  ill then pay the local government to keep their mouths shut, and when they get found out, pay off the multimillion Euro fines as 'business expense' because they have no doubt made a lot more. Banks create economics bubbles with irresponsible lending, then take bail from government reserves - the taxpayers' money, the ones in charge never face repercussions. Or perhaps western automobile and electronic manufactuters keep paying for Cobalt from Africa to fill the dictators' coffers, despite all of them knowing Cobalt mines are cesspools of oppression, human rights abuses, so that they could make a profit?

Or maybe France - Liberté, egalité, fraternité, attempted to return to their indochina colonies after the war for further exploitation? Or maybe western liberal democracies turning a blind eye to the wars and genocides happening right now in Africa, because Americans abd Russians want to sell more weapons there, wars that they played no small part in causing because of colonialism?

Those same western democracies now suddenly care about Ukraine, despite decades-long conflicts having killed more in Africa many times over?

They only care about Ukraine, because Ukraine being taken over would mean a Russian victory, Russia becoming stronger, Russia having more influence over Europe, gaining a foothold in Eastern Europe. If Ukraine were some 3rd world warzone in Africa they wouldn't give a damn, they might even be glad that Russia is ""pacifying"" the country.

[],False,,RogueAOV,,,,,,"1. If Russia demonstrates they are prepared to use nuclear weapons, the world in general must assume they are prepared to use them again. The world would want to take steps to ensure it does not happen again/cannot happen again. If the world does not react, then what stops Russia from nuking someone else, or anyone else nuking someone else for that matter. Russia would have completely moved from someone that can be negotiated with to a completely irrational actor that is a threat to the survival of the species.
2. That is the definition of  winning the fight but losing the war, although it can be debated the causes of this war the natural oil and gas reserves found in Ukraine and in the Crimean sea would likely be one of the main deciding factors. Either for direct economic gain, or to simply stop Ukraine from being a direct competitor to those interests. If Russia became completely isolated as a result of nuclear escalation then not only do they lose that resource income but they lose even the ability to function beyond subsistence level. The sanctions right now might not mean that Putin et all have to eat moldy potatoes but after a first strike nuclear option, that is likely all they would have.
3. The India situation like all geopolitics is complicated, and yes China would like an ally against the west, but if Russia went nuclear and was then completely isolated, China maintaining close ties to that threat would likely then be viewed as the next threat to be isolated. China maintains close ties with NK as a useful idiot to get benefits from the west. China will guide NK to do this if they get X for example. China wants to ensure NK does not mind if NK goes full crazy... as long as the crazy is contained, just like Russia, a mutual thorn in the west's side is one thing, a existential threat is something else. China is not in a good place right now, it has a great deal of internal economic and social problems, it may go very badly, very quickly there if things are not maintained, siding with someone the world loathes is not going to ensure things continue to go well. Yes they did seem to side with Russia at first, but they were also told this would be quick and painless, a likely testing ground for Taiwan strategies, China has very quickly seen that not only can the west react, it can come together and react strongly, making its weaker position far more dangerous.
4. As the fight is in the east a small nuclear weapon being deployed to break the lines is a catastrophic tactic. Your troops are going to have to advance and hold positions inside the vicinity of the explosion, so your already weakened force is going to be dying exponentially from fallout. The conquered territory is now irradiated and worthless and depending on the wind direction either Russia is contaminated or NATO territory is. One is really bad for domestic politics, the other is considered a nuclear first strike on a NATO member triggering article 5 and a complete annihilation of the Russian threat. Risking those small gains for such potential catastrophic losses would be considered madness and another reason to abandon Russia as an ally to anyone still by their side.
5. Same as four, wind direction would be key, but it is very important to note, the nuclear response is not triggered by how bad your strike is, it is triggered by you launching. So even if Russia fired one faulty nuke and it failed to detonate, there is a very good chance that the hundreds flying in retaliation work just fine.
6. People have refused first strike orders before, by and large people, particularly soldiers have no problem laying down their lives for a cause, for a reason, they are, however,  extremely hesitant to die for nothing, and nuclear war is death.
7. You can beat people down, you can threaten them, you can kill them but at a certain point they are going to say enough. If Ukraine has nothing to lose, they will never stop fighting, they have no other purpose than to seek revenge, they will never stop resisting, they will never even consider it as an option, they will kill you, they will kill themselves to kill you. There is a reason why Hearts and Minds are so important in taking control of ""enemy"" territory, at some point the people have to stop hating you enough to consider working with you, consider accepting the new order, Russia has already crossed that line with their actions but those could be considered local, nuclear weapons are not local.
8. Yes Russia has natural resources, and they are the building blocks of a robust economy. What Russia lacks is the knowledge and technology to exploit those resources fully. The west supplies much of the expertise to extract the oil and gas, the west provides much of the market for those goods. As time passes machines break, parts need replaced, and these are extremely specialized sometimes even custom parts that are simply impossible to replace. Not only may they lack the purity of materials to build a replacement, but they might not even have the ability to know exactly what the problem is. Sure they can eventually figure it out, but the key problem is that an economy is just the movement of money, the trade of goods. You can extract a million barrels of oil a day, but if no one can even buy fifty thousand barrels what is the point?, How healthy is the economy going to be if you are trading a barrel of oil for a loaf of bread.
9. Russia is ruined on the world stage at this point, but a lot can change in a few years. If the Russian Federation collapses and a new leader emerges pledging to pay reparations to Ukraine, help with any and all war crimes investigations and is suitably humble the world will forgive and forget eventually. The people of Ukraine,  directly affected will take longer to forget obviously but time will pass and wounds will heal, bridges will be mended. Rational thought will put the blame at Putin and failed military doctrine as much as ill-trained elements in the military ""going too far"" ""bad apples"" etc etc. Every military in history has had incidents they would rather forget and although some are far far worse than others, to an extent people can grasp that just because a Russia did this, not all Russians are too blame etc. In this conflict there seems to be a ""is this really Genocide? or Ethnic Cleansing"" angle to it, like it is some academic study for the history books so it is easy to forget the direct human angle in the scope of the human tragedy. It might take years after the war ends for the truth to all come out and the magnitude to be fully understood and that will obviously affect that time line but there is no going back if Russia goes nuclear, there is no point they will not be remembered for that. The US bombed Japan, but at least that ended a war, Japan had made it clear it was going to be a street by street massacre to take the country, America wanted to rattle the nuclear sabre to ensure ""nuclear peace"" in our time etc etc, you can come up with plenty of reasons why they had to drop it, but everyone knows that is was ultimately a threat to its enemies, not one government did not get that message. Russia dropping a nuke would be the same thing, but without ending the war and with zero pretense it ""had to be done to save lives!""",fba004134faff700021b23dbc1c54ecdfb867b0d,True,False,,,,,0,1652060478,,0,{},i7vaeht,False,t3_ul07ek,False,True,t1_i7uorfb,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ul07ek/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_08_2022/i7vaeht/,1652060495,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652031678.0,[],text,t2_c0i2hmk,False,False

Why the fuck would helicopters stop VC from infiltrating cities and then launching planned murder sprees on a designated day and hour? Or is it apples and oranges. 

If the helicopter was poor at preventing that, how about infantry riding atop a tank? Riding inside APC or IFV? Dismounted infantry walking?  Would they have stopped it from happening? Or is it apples and oranges.

It is in terms of gross value. I never claimed that it comparable in any other way.

&gt;No, the Russian economy is not comparable to that of Germany either, another extremely advanced economy with an equally advanced manufacturing sector.

It is in terms of GDP at purchasing power parity.

&gt;In terms of advanced production, Russia's manufacturing is hardly able to keep up with its RnD. The military is constantly showcasing things that only ever make it through a couple of production examples before the budget dries up.

Well, let's see. Over the last decade-ish, Russia has acquired:

* Almost 2,000 BTR-82s
* 9 modernized Kilo-class submarines
* 3 Grigorovich-class frigates
* 2 Gorshkov-class frigates
* About 125 Su-34s
* About 100 Su-35s
* And various other stuff

Ultimately, you seem to think in binary terms, i.e. Russia needs to be a fully self-sufficient, cutting-edge industrial power or it cannot surge production of anything.

My point is that there's, in fact, a middle ground: Russia has a reasonably large, if far from world-class, industrial sector. It depends on foreign suppliers for key components but, given the limited scope of its pre-war imports of key technologies, at least relative to its overall imports / size of its economy, it is far from clear that it cannot reorient imports to adjust to the new circumstances.

Russia won't be churching out thousands of Armatas and Su-57s anytime soon, but a commitment to general mobilization - both military and industrial - would certainly allow Russia to increase military equipment production, albeit said equipment would be unlikely to be on par with what the West can supply Ukraine.",fee2bbdb3e026ba26bae618c624876f9a2b18c02,True,False,,,,,0,1652057217,,0,{},i7v3u8d,False,t3_ukrhnr,False,True,t1_i7v0y4n,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ukrhnr/russias_manpower_conundrum_in_ukraine_russia_is/i7v3u8d/,1652057232,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652028417.0,[],text,t2_3rh4cbrh,False,False

Germany's GDP is not inflated by massive hydrocarbon exports, which subsidize nearly every sector of the Russian economy going back to the 70's.

What manufacturing Russia has is heavily tilted towards basic, precursor goods just like in Soviet days. Russia can make you a million slabs of cold rolled steel, sure, but it will be done inefficiently because Russian manufacturing is propped up by subsidy and a low wage workforce.

A huge high-level aspect of this war is that the kind of western-facing Ukrainian nationalism Zelenskyy and his party offered was met with pretty high levels of skepticism.
