The mission to impose a no-fly zone over Libya to protect Libyan civilians was legal under international law.

While the no-fly zone was authorized, it wasn't a significant part of NATO intervention in Libya. The bigger intervention was under Para. 4 of UNSCR 1973: 

&gt; ...take all necessary measures...to protect civilians and
civilian populated areas under threat of attack in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, including Benghazi

This ""all necessary measures"" gradually morphed into regime change. According to UK Chief of Defense Staff Lord Richards: 

&gt; During Benghazi, an increasingly influential set of people started saying, “If
we’re really going to protect civilians, you’ve got to get rid of Gaddafi.” That is
when I said, “Well, is that really sensible? What are we going to do if he goes?”
and all the things that I had learned through bitter experience. That was rather
ignored in the majority view, which was, “We need to get rid of him, simply to
make sure we meet the political aim of preventing large-scale civilian loss of
life.

For his part, Putin warned that the Resolution should not be allowed to turn into regime change, or Libya would become a disaster (a stance which earned him a rare rebuke from Medvedev). 

As it turns out, France had spiked the intelligence on Libya and had it's own mercenary agenda (according to Sidney Blumenthal's discussions with French intelligence officials): 

&gt; According to these individuals Sarkozy’s plans are driven by the following
issues:

a. A desire to gain a greater share of Libya oil production,

b. Increase French influence in North Africa,

c. Improve his internal political situation in France,

d. Provide the French military with an opportunity to reassert its position in
the world,

e. Address the concern of his advisors over Qaddafi’s long term plans to
supplant France as the dominant power in Francophone Africa.",d7ec122f90cfb9f19ff2c776e0a11bec2e753ced,True,False,,,,,0,1652139088,,0,{},i7zf9b7,False,t3_ulv9vk,False,True,t1_i7yv61l,/r/geopolitics/comments/ulv9vk/our_soldiers_are_defending_our_motherland_in/i7zf9b7/,1652139104,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1652110288.0,[],text,t2_7n1sq,False,False,

Tbf, i don't think that you can compare the war in Afghanistan to Ukraine. 

Afghanistan had  and has no meaning to the average America and wasn't there to ""prove"" anything. It was essentially a classic military intervention that had turned into a clusterfuck. We've done it before and its happened to plenty of other countries as well.

[],False,,ChiknHug,,,,,,"Sure!

Your point about Silicon Valley is very accurate. I actually live in the Valley myself and it’s very advanced especially compared to most places. A lot of tech does come out of here, but I feel that especially in recent years I’ve seen more big news come from Asia than from here, though I’ll readily admit that’s subjective.

I think a better indicator of this is that Asian patents have not outpaced most Western, if not all of the Western countries.

This by itself also isn’t really foolproof so in general, I think it’s very much up in the air. But as the post mentioned China is digging it’s fingers into multiple tech pies, and rather than having to work hard all it really needs to do is leech off of Western discoveries and make their own versions.

I do think that especially when it comes to things like vaccines Chinese tech is far behind, but the rest of Asia is pretty advanced in terms of virus protection. South Korea had and honestly probably still had one of if not the best Covid responses in the world, plus their new air invention that kills influenza will come in handy. Japan as well has been a hub for tech activity, and while American companies are the top dogs right now China is slowly but steadily rising, as is Asia in general. I feel that if not China, then at the very least the rest of Asia will rise a lot.

That being said it’s not like I’m belittling the capabilities of the West, I just think that thinking that technologies will solely be dominated by the West in the future is a bit too optimistic. Maybe a few, but I’d seriously doubt all or even a majority should the Asian Century come to pass.

I think polarization in the West is being downplayed. Political polarization is causing a huge divide in the US and the EU, and pretty soon choosing between an increasingly radicalized right wing and a stagnant and frankly disingenuous centre-right party just won’t work anymore. As for the EU, we’re seeing a similar situation in France and the UK, though I honestly think the rest of Europe will probably survive this wave of radicalization.

As for how it would affect tech development, I think we’ve seen an absolutely gigantic pushback against Covid lockdowns and tech in the US specifically but also in other places in the West. Not to say there hasn’t been discontent in Asia or Africa, but I honestly think that New Zealand and a few countries in the EU were the only real good responders to the Covid situation. This has obviously changed but the sort of systemic, anti-science narrative in the US persists. In fact the Republicans are systematically trying to gut the US education system, and honestly besides California and maybe Texas I don’t think the US will have many leading tech sectors anymore unless it gets serious about tackling the educational problems it’s causing.

As for the declining standards of life, we’ve already seen European share of the world’s GDP steadily decline. The US remains more or less constant but that may change with the recent economic struggles. I understand share of GDP doesn’t mean much but a good chunk of the US now lives in poverty or paycheck to paycheck, and a good chunk of Europe may be detrimentally affected by the Eurozone Crisis. I honestly doubt it in the case of Europe but I do think that their standards of living are declining relatively. As Asia and Africa grow, the European share of the pie will likely shrink as it already has.

I think your point about Asian civil unrest does make sense, but I’d argue that most of the big players in the region either are resilient enough to deal with said civil unrest or have, in China’s case, strong enough propaganda systems. The US and France have riots on a fairly constant basis, China has protests, but it doesn’t really mean they’ll fall apart. It’s just a natural part of nations, IMO.

As for demographic collapse and food shortages, I do agree those are issues but I think they could very much be offset by other factors. I mean, besides developing areas the US is pretty much the only other country that has steady demographics, as Europe is turning to massive immigration from places such as Africa and China is trying to get its population going again. I think that possible African emigration to China because of its strong ties, or Indian emigration if China gets serious about wooing India into an alliance, could help offset this collapse. I understand that these may not happen and are probably speculative thinking but it still is possible. In any case, China’s biggest economic weakness, that being its reliance on manufacturing, is being slowly transitioned to India by Chinese companies. I feel that as time goes on, if nothing happens, Asia as a whole will rise on the backs of India and China.

As for the tech sectors, I do agree that’s an issue. It’s not like I think China has a big shot, I just think that the government has the need to and the capabilities to develop new technology. Climate technology especially will be a must have especially in places like Shanghai, and we’ve seen the Chinese government scramble to counteract desertification. I certainly think that they can do it, though honestly I feel that at this point in time they’re more than happy to, again, leech off the West’s tech. I just feel that that will change in a decade or two.

As for universities, yeah, a lot of Asia does go to American universities. I’d argue that’s more of a prestige thing than an effectiveness thing, though that’s also open to debate.

On May 2nd Mali officially declared the end of all military cooperation with France.  Mali has recently turned to Russia for military hardware and Wagner Group for training and support.  However, this help will be insufficient to fill the vacuum that French and EU support provided.  As Russia has more pressing concerns to their neighbor in the west, they will be reluctant to dump any meaningful resources in Mali.  So, Russia will not be filling any vacuums in Mali, as some commentators suggest.  This leaves the military government and the jihadist.  Recently the military launched an operation in the jihadist-controlled town of Moura, where they claimed to neutralize 203 fighters.  NGOs report that majority of those killed were purportedly civilians.  Regardless, the military left Moura after the operation, proving that they lack the manpower to leave any meaningful contingents in jihadist safe havens.  A lengthy stalemate is the most likely scenario as the insurgents lack the capacity to threaten the densely populated South and the military lacks the manpower to patrol this vast country. As Mali failed to reign in the insurgency with U.S. intelligence and French military might, there is no indication they will fare better alone.

  
As for the French, they will have to recognize that popular sentiment is against them in many of these countries.  Out of perceived necessity they often cooperate with detested leaders, leaving them unprepared when these individuals are overthrown. Also noted by J. Peter Pham, former U.S. envoy to the Sahel, claimed to have witnessed the disrespectful treatment that French officials meted out to their Malian counterparts.

They did not try to pull a lawyer move by arguing that while the absence of UN Security Council authorization precludes one country from lawfully attacking another, no such authorization is necessary for a ""coalition"" of countries (plural) to lawfully attack a country.

You're right as far as that goes - Kosovo was a 'humanitarian war'. The question was, who gets to decide what is a humanitarian war. NATO's answer was, NATO can decide this. 

The supplementary argument was that it was remarkable that so many democratic countries could unite on a military action. This became problematic because the UN doesn't recognize any legal difference between a democratic government or an authoritarian one, or a monarchy. 

That's how we end up with Yemen - the Saudi monarchy was able to bribe enough members to form a ""coalition"", and that coalition then had the right to decide that invading Yemen was legal. 

It was the same thing in Libya. Hillary Clinton's last stop before pushing for US involvement was obtaining the endorsement of the Arab League (minus Syria, which had been suspended). 

So however we slice it, this still amounts to the same thing - a regional coalition has the right to decide when offensive warfare is legitimate, and the UN Charter does not apply.

But it's also clear to me that Chinas has huge structural issues (an export dependent economy, and one of the fastest aging populations in the world). 

I can imagine that a similar article was written about Japan a couple of decades ago. 

Not to say I think China has Japan's stagnation in their future (they might). Maybe some of their technological advances are truly transformative instead of just value added. 

I think my default way of thinking is that the big structural issues are more important than the specific, narrower advantages.

That's not the only case, the US regularly has denied extradition requests for terrorists and murderers that awaited trials in Latin American countries (as well as others worldwide). A couple of examples:

Like Brazil, in order to become the agricultural power that they are now, needed soooooo much capital. Unlike the midwest, where the land is just begging to be farmed. The Brazilians needed to destroy the jungle, literally sterilize the earth to destroy any Jungle left in the soil, and then pump it full of fertilizer so that the crops you want to grow can actually grow there. On top of that, Brazilian geography is a basically a series of cliffs, so the capital required to create infrastructure to that can get those goods from farms to the ocean is equally massive. 

Unfortunately a lot of the global south is similar. Africa has very few navigable rivers, and the geography is really not conducive to inexpensive infrastructure projects. In a capital rich environment like we're currently in, there's enough available capital to find outlets in very expensive infrastructure projects. 

In a world of shrinking working age populations in the wealthier part of the world, I think capital will be a lot more scarce, and unfortunately that means that there'll probably be more immediately profitable sources for that capital than long term infrastructure project in Africa.  

China has talked a lot about rebalancing to demand, but so far has not implemented any of the major structural overhauls to make that happen. The only sustainable way to do that would be for China to do this would be to engineer a massive redistribution of income to Chinese households. Personally, I think this is unlikely as the people who benefit the most from the current system are the the people who are in charge of the current system. 

Haha so we're both from the US. Personally, I've felt that way at times, but my current thought is that us Americans can have a tendency to be a little over-reactionary about our current position in history. I agree that the country is pretty politically fractured right now, but I think we all tend to overestimate how bad it really is. 

Also there's really low hanging fruit for improving our local economy. Both political parties are becoming more protectionist, IMO it's only a matter of time before one of the parties takes serious steps to balance the trade deficit (I think Trump would have done it already if he had been better at getting policy from his Twitter fingers to Congress). This will come at the expense of some of our geopolitical leverage, but will allow the US economy to rebalance towards much more productive growth.

Regarding the US dollar, all those underlying factors may be true, but ending dollar dominance would require massive structural changes for that to happen. The simplest reason that China hold foreign assets is because of a deficit of internal demand, and an excess of production. If your country is running a consistent trade surplus, you need another country to be willing to run an off-setting trade deficit. Here's a great article on it in case you're interested- https://carnegieendowment.org/chinafinancialmarkets/86878

I would say I pretty bearish on economic growth for almost all economies in the coming decade. The last century plus growth has come during a time when countries' populations having been growing. Now we're reaching a point in history when the world's largest generations, the baby boomers, are reaching retirement. The world is going to have to deal with a declining skilled labour force and less access to capital. 

What this will mean is impossible to say. I've heard the argument made that the US due to it's decent demographics is better set-up to handle this next decade of uncertainty than a country like Korea or China who have horrible demographics. Do I fully believe that? I'm not sure. 

I don't have a strong point to make on the future of western tech. Personally, I think that the stock market's performance has mostly been due to the US's ability to absorb the excess savings of the world.

IMO the most likely scenario is that due to world-wide demographic decline and the US's (relative) insulation from that decline, the US will still be seen as the safest place to hold assets. Whether that actually happens, or whether the US still wants to be the receiver of unproductive capital, I'm no so sure.",59d7db05d04e76917faa394e77a9b250eaa51a91,True,False,,,,,0,1652123021,,0,{},i7ydqo7,False,t3_ukqqut,False,True,t1_i7xx3kp,/r/geopolitics/comments/ukqqut/as_the_future_of_china_is_unclear_would_a_world/i7ydqo7/,1652123037,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1652094221.0,[],text,t2_7q6sqy,False,False,

China will produced 10x the stem grads as the US), building times, other infrastructural concerns (water needed for fabs). It's a mess which suggests all these transitions are much harder than initially planned. And not to add, lots of these fabs are useless. If all things using these chips are being assembled in China, SK, Vietnam, Malaysia, what are they going to do with chips in Phoenix? Adds more costs to ship them back and forth as well. 

Those older chips are enough to power missiles, ships, factories, computers etc. And china has made shocking progress in all areas including lithography as well. They are not the best nor will they be anytime soon, but in the context of my original comment (blindly using GDP is bad for geopolitical comparisons), my point still holds. There is still an inherent value of being able to in house things like chips which GDP fails to measure. Ditto for Huawei - the west can successfully bully countries to stop using them but bullying is only a stop gap arrangement. What's the long term plan? All it has done is further convince China to isolate its western vulnerabilities which will strengthen vis a vis the west (not reflected in the Gdp). 

I never said China is not facing issues or will not have problems but China still makes and produces hard goods and has the most supply chains localized. All those shipping and demand issues you mentioned are mostly downstream of failures in the West along with covid policies in China (which are foolish). Obviously, major economic collapse in the West would affect china and the world as a whole. The belt and road projects are being stopped exactly for this reason as many developing countries have to plan out their projects carefully. 
 

I was not referring to the Chinese media. When the evergrande issue hit, bloomberg was publishing an article every day - the hysteria finally had to settle. And yet again, the loss of value of evergrande and other realty developers came as the result of new laws that limited their leverage. This is an intentional attack on developers to improve the structural health of the economy. An economic slowdown is better than a complete meltdown and Chinese have shown a willingness to harm corporations in exchange for stability - we can call it authoritarianism, populism, desire for power but it is the case. They are doing the same thing to service sector (tech). 

The housing bubble is overrated in the sense that it is exaggerated. Remember all the ""ghost"" cities of 10 years ago - most of them are full of people and occupied. There is an oversupply certainly, but it's more localized (property development in China is done on the city level so irresponsible governments localize the problems). And arguably it's better to have excess housing than turn society into a permanent renter class, enriching Blackrock as they buy single family homes in upcoming neighborhoods. This is also what i mean by ordinary people. I am a rich Westerner who's benefitting significantly in this inflationary bull market but ordinary Americans turning into permanent renters are getting ruined. A housing price collapse would likely help a lot of ordinary Americans but ruin the wealthy and governments (who rely on property tax, which is another issue all together as it incentivizes governments to keep housing inflated. China is just experimenting with property tax at the moment, which would also likely deflate their housing prices more) 

China is even more unequal than the US - the excess housing is owned only by a minority of Chinese. The xi government has shown no qualms in buying it off the bankrupt developers. 

And i never said china doesn't have problems nor did i say they won't face economic slowdown or contraction. But it won't collapse the country any more then 08 or the great depression collapsed the US. And none of this changes the fundamental point of GDP failing to capture many of the non tangible and structural factors, as well as civilizational momentum. How long did it take from German unification to Germany becoming the industrial and scientific leader of the world? How long did it take the US from being the largest economy in world at the start of 20th century to becoming the scientific and industrial behemoth that won the cold War?",64f2185d46a9b84c6eb0294688a7f9bfd4eaa698,True,False,,,,,0,1652121088,,0,{},i7y8znm,False,t3_ukqqut,False,True,t1_i7y057f,/r/geopolitics/comments/ukqqut/as_the_future_of_china_is_unclear_would_a_world/i7y8znm/,1652121104,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1652092288.0,[],text,t2_rqa20,False,False,

The US people are great and do things like donate money for causes that they sympathize with. The US government does not. When the US conducts humanitarian operations the people who organize it within the government have to document and specify how the act of helping these people is connected to advancing a particular US strategic objective. Sympathy never comes into the equation. 


The US will work with basically whoever will advance their objectives until the point when they don't. For example, the US for years worked with Juan Orlando Hernández, the ex president of Honduras. On 27 Jan 2022 he left office, on 14 Feb his residency was surrounded by Honduran national police and US DEA agents. He is now in the US facing life in prison. 


Since the war began, Zelenskyy has done a great job for his people. However remember the majority of information that people consume about the war is dictated by the US and somewhat by European governments. This is why you don't hear too much about the rumors of corruption and millions that Zelenskyy is said to have stashed away in European bank accounts. It will be interesting to see what plays out with him once he is no longer useful to the US, if he will end up like a Juan Orlando Hernández or if he stays looking like a hero for his country. We'll wait years though to find out.

""Old Europe"" prevailed on the Iraq issue, with the result that EU states had only a token participation. This time it's the other way around - the EU has embraced the traditional US approach of seeing conflict in Hobbesian terms. 

It's been an impressive display of solidarity so far. Robert Kagan used to say that ""US is from Mars. Europe is from Venus"", but that gap hasn't been evident in any practical sense. 

That said, ""Old Europe"" hasn't gone anywhere. Triumphalism is most attractive when it's fed on a strict diet of triumphs.

To be as rich as you, where that counts as merely ""lost some money""! And Evergrande is far from the only developer experiencing problems, you know that right?

The entire Chinese real estate system is currently down between 30-50 percent in sales and development from last year...which wasn't a great year either. There's also no end in sight. An authoritarian country's ability to clamp down on media reporting about their massive problems domestically doesn't mean that problem ceases to exist.

""Empty housing is overrated"" - how? We're looking at the largest capital misallocation in history. Want to explain why that isn't a problem? And how this isn't a problem for people who ""just buy property as an investment"" when those investments are losing value en masse? How does that match with ""most ordinary citizens were fine""? 

Western economies have their problems, but explain how the world's largest bubble is ""magnitudes better"" than western attitudes to an economy? I haven't even touched on the other areas of the Chinese economy...service sector activity, down (second weakest reading on record for April). New export orders, down. Every single subindex fell in April including prices. Employment shrank for the fourth consecutive month. CNY depreciating. Bet you 100 yuan that you don't make the 5.5% growth target this year.

Huawei is a first-class 5G provider...who can't sell their product to the rich half of the planet due to sanctions. China's industrial capacity (when not stymied by shipping issues or lockdowns) is exported to countries who no longer wish to absorb China's excess savings at their own expense, and China's domestic demand is nowhere near enough to replacing it despite Xi's 'dual circulation' aspirations. 

And hurrah for last generation chips! - except the West was making these around the same time that ping-pong diplomacy was in action, still makes the most complex fabrications, and will still find either the domestic capacity or the next up-and-coming country to make them long after China shuts its doors on the world, which seems to be happening now. I'll agree with the rest of what you say, but gently suggest aspirational entrepreneurs may have taken a look at what has happened to the more successful of their number over the last two years and decided to try their luck elsewhere.

I'm not keen on Sinophiles spruiking the superiority of their system while currently pretending it isn't losing value in spectacular amounts, with absolutely no Plan B for the economy or maintaining GDP...except maybe trying to make some more apartments or infrastructure.

Biden also banned fracking on federal land which makes it more risky because who knows what other sabotage will come. The cancelation of the keystone pipeline. And he's a moderate Democrat. 

I wasn't directly referring to the light/heavy crude issues but that does factor in when we consider in investments and building production capacity. 

An export deal to Europe could be worked out but it's still quite hard in the short term. Pipelines are the best way to ship oil and rail second. Ships are pretty bad but is the only way the US could supply Europe. But again, ship building is a limiting factor and none of the west is really particularly pushing out ships at a high rate. Finally, a lot of nat gas and oil (including American gas) is still being sold to Asia because prices are higher there - Europeans are paying eye watering prices to out compete this. A deal could be worked out but considering all the oil production in the US is private, it would have to involve some government investment or subsidies, which again I think is very hard in the current political climate. 

How is demand for US debt higher? The USD appreciates for sure because the US economy is growing but there's a massive debate as to how natural that it. But US treasuries have reached an all time low in the Chinese reserves and they've announced an intent to diversify. There's no way they will not continue to split from that after the whole stolen Russian reserves fiasco.

 Currently the economy is fine but what happens when there is a crash - congress and fed rely heavily on widespread and growing demand for US debt? How much does it need to fall for it to become a problem? Especially if they need to fix a major recession? Remember in 2008, it was china that saved the west from a lot of trouble using their excess cash (the Chinese perspective of this is really interesting actually - they view the entire pivot to Asia and propaganda campaign as a betrayal of their friendliness to the West in 08. Naive for sure but it's a popular enough viewpoint in China to consider - self reflection is something many geopolitical ""experts“ lack) . That's not going to happen again. 

And speaking of economy, the past 30 years, the US had very little inflation. The current economic system involves the US exporting its inflation and the fed actively deflating the value of its debt. Why would countries want to keep holding debt that becomes worth less and less every year?

Mind you, I don't think the USD will die and will still be an absolute majority (especially in transactions and pricing) but with the rise of various currency swaps, SWIFT alternatives, etc - it will lose the monopoly power that the US government seems to rely on to fight conflicts without fighting.

And another less regarded aspect - western tech is out of the golden days. I thought the Trump ban fiasco would herald this but this ""ban all dissent"" campaign will be the end. Why would you let some silicon valley progressives working with the pentagon and some hyper liberal think tanks control the discourse in your country? India is already acting strongly against this, as are countries all over the global south. I suspect digital sovereignty will become a huge issue globally. How much of the western stock market growth is based on tech stocks?

That's already an order of magnitude better than western attitudes towards the economy.

[],False,,bnav1969,,,,,,"Yeah agreed. It's nice to have a decent conversation and I think there's no denying that the wealth created by a market economy allows a lot more development and creation - but again in what? Back in cold War there were lots of periods of development but it was the semi conductor industry (silicon valley birth) , then computers (dell &amp; HP), then the internet bubble. The ""start in the garage"" nature of these industries benefitted heavily from the US.

But today - what are the major developments? I am in tech myself but let's be real, Facebook, Google, only fans, etc have limited use, especially since they are heavily concentrated in advertising and services. Amazon's logistics optimizations and AWS are probably the most important developments that have come out of the US. And undoubtedly, while machine learning and AI is a important field, it's tricky - the US might have better tech but the Chinese are better at applying it in wider systems (their economy and society is more digital than the US, due to recent developments). Hardware wise, Shenzen is probably the greatest place on earth. 

I guess the real question is if Russia will truly be isolated or start collaborating with China - not even on a state level but on a people to people level. How many of the US's early technological developments were based on collaboration with British and German scientists, especially in physics? How quickly did it take for the US to switch from that stage to becoming the leader of innovation globally? Or going further back - German unification? How quickly did it take for the British to become a supporter of unified Germany to stick it to the French to doing everything they could to sabotage it (sounds eerily similar to the US, Soviet Union/Russia, and China)?

Regarding the production capacity that's a good point and imho is really THE key opportunity for China. India wants to buy a lot of Russian oil but can't because of transport and infrastructure. Same with much of South east Asia (Asia in general). I am not a China hawk and believe much of their antagonistic (to non western countries) foreign policy was miscalculations, because their real threat is the US. Pipeline networks through China into Asia + combined LNG terminal networks and advanced ships could be a genuine game changer. Obviously a lot of this is currently a pipedream but the opportunity remains on the table.

Imho the main bet is still Asia &gt; Europe. It's hard to say how it will pan out. But it's a growing market (Indonesia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia alone are massive markets with giant growth rates that Europe simply cannot match).",3b1b490eb6ca3d6c8204a8b6827e9ce669cea4f0,True,False,,,,,0,1652113826,,0,{},i7xqyvz,False,t3_ukqqut,False,True,t1_i7xofhz,/r/geopolitics/comments/ukqqut/as_the_future_of_china_is_unclear_would_a_world/i7xqyvz/,1652113838,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1652085026.0,[],text,t2_rqa20,False,False,

[],False,,Full_Cartoonist_8908,,,,,,"I've got a few ideas. But before I get going so you don't think I'm coming from the wrong place, I'm excited about the technologies you've listed as well. Here's your problems about the rest of the world not getting massively excited as well, at least in my opinion.

For energy technologies, this is a field swamped by exciting revolutionary discoveries...that go nowhere. Seriously, for every ten technologies that are developed and have a frothy article written about them, maybe one comes to anything. As an example, go back twelve years and the exciting technologies were solar-panel sidewalks and roads, wave power generation, geothermal anywhere, and thermal energy storage just to name a few. I live in a state which has a failed geothermal plant and a rusted-out wave power generator that sank soon after implementation. Solar-panel sidewalks and roads were a bust. Investors in all of these lost their money. Thermal energy storage is killed off by the space it requires, matched with the proximity it needs to where the energy is used plus the huge increase in land prices of the last decade. However, my state has a large unsexy battery array that makes us 100% renewable on many days of the year. Mass adoption of energy technologies happens in increments based off proven tech.

Secondly, a lot of leadership these days are either bean-counters or professional politicians and not technologists. They are also in many cases of the age bracket that is still struggling to use mobile phones and the internet let alone being across tech's cutting edge. Apt technologists and engineers in CEO, funding, or political roles are rare. When it comes to spending they're like Hollywood producers, they want a sure proven thing even if it's unoriginal. They are also hard for technologists to pitch to, you're often looking at special roles with research centres like universities where people translate research findings into something that money can understand. This is tricky, and you have to swim with the tide which is whatever the political agenda of the day is spending money on. Results also have to be measured in quarters (for CEOS) and terms of up to 4 years (for politicians). 

Thirdly, just because something is a great idea doesn't mean anyone will invest in it. I'm an investor in a company that produces a cream that treats some types of melanoma. Passed all pre-market trials in a number of countries. Never went to market. It was discovered that it also helps phototoxicity in EPP patients, and it went to market. Why that, and not melanoma? Absolutely beats the hell out of me. It seems that the matching of technology and prototyping to finance is a rare art with many moving parts. 

Addressing a few of your techs specifically:

\- Cellular agriculture is still far too expensive. It'll happen, eventually. You got to realise that a simpler concept such as vertical farming is way over a decade old, can also help massively reduce input costs and consistency in food stuffs, and is still barely used. Tech moves fast. The industries that implement them move in decades and centuries

\- Plasma drilling. Hope something comes of it. But often the earth's crust before heat sources appear can be 70 kilometres thick. The deepest drilling so far is the Kila superdeep borehole, about 12 kilometres. That took 20 years. Plasma drilling has some potential, in some sites, in some places, and would then face the same geothermal capture issues found elsewhere. Those are the hurdles before it reaches potential

\- Prefabbed buildings already happening. It's still cheaper to renovate an existing building to print a new one, and that also ignores the main problem with building these days: the cost of the land it's built on 

\- Space industry...not sure why you think the West isn't keeping up with China? SpaceX and the various projects for Mars (as well as the rover) indicate to me that the West isn't anywhere near being left behind yet

\- Mass drone capabilities seem to be coming along and not being left behind except by some defence dinosaurs. I think the West will get hung up on the ethics of this and may have to play catch-up at some point when forced to. But forget about China making cheap switchblades or military drones for the West. It won't happen, I don't see any defence manufacturers moving construction to a strategic competitor who demands IP sharing as part of the deal for manufacturing. That era is ending

\- Machine Learning and AI: unpredictable. No one bets on unpredictable. 50 years ago, computers were heralded as something that would make jobs obsolete and free up people for other projects. And now? I'd argue resource usage immediately expands to the bandwidth available to it

Hope this explains why a few things are the way they are.

Egypt would have started a war that it'll lose in the long run. Egypt can't change geography. 

The Nile river they need to survive will always start in Ethiopia. It's a bad idea to piss off a country that has the beginning of the Nile river that gives Egypt their drinking water.

Blowing up the dam means 85 Million Ethiopians will never get electricity which means they'll most definitely poison the Nile river. Ethiopia will view it as an act of aggression since Egypt did start the war. 

Do you honestly expect to blow up the dam and not have Ethiopia harm Egypt back? 

They will probably do anything to harm Egypt including war crimes as blowing up a civilian dam is a war crime so Ethiopia will do a war crime right back like poisoning the water. 

The gloves are definitely going to be coming off if a war starts and Egypt won't go unscathed if they do start a war.

Geography of the Nile river gives Ethiopia the upper hand. The only way Egypt can even win long-term without the Nile river being poisoned is if they occupy Ethiopia which is near impossible since Ethiopia's population is higher than Egypt's and Ethiopia has the highest mountains in Africa which would make an Egyptian occupation near impossible because of nonstop insurgencies. This would be like Afghanistan with the Taliban hiding in the mountains but with a very huge insurgency compared to the Taliban.

With Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces bogged down in Ukraine, apparently unable to defeat one of the poorest nations in Europe, and China locking up millions of people in a seemingly never-ending battle to contain COVID-19, the once-ubiquitous idea of inevitable Western decline has suddenly been called into question. Out of nowhere, the free world once again stands for something, and is even showing signs of shaking itself out of its decades-long torpor.

Forget the idea that the United Nations and the World Trade Organization are fit for purpose; they aren’t. And forget utopian beliefs about the inevitable progress of democracy; they’re mistaken.

Instead, Britain’s Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told me, the West needs to start fighting back. Truss called for the G7 to be “more institutionalized” and turned into an “economic NATO” that can defend its members from Chinese economic coercion.

I would argue it's not about a total loss of western oil field production, but more about degrees. We've seen with the large discounts Russian oil is currently selling at that they're having difficulty finding buyers for their crude (or maybe having trouble actually getting that oil to buyers). That's were storage really becomes an issue. The oil market in a country only works if there is always a never ending line of tankers ready to transport that oil. No country has the storage for an excess production of 1 million barrels a day. I don't think Russian production will disappear, but I think there's a good amount of risk that that production capacity will be greatly reduced. 

Interesting points about Iran and Russia (with China I'd argue it was the lifting of the sanctions that allowed them to develop a broad industrial economy). I once heard an interesting anecdote about the USSR and the US that framed the way I think about this. 

The USSR's space program was incredibly impressive, and at the time they did some really cutting edge stuff with computers to support that program. The US was trying to catch up with the Soviet Space industry for a while. 

But the US weren't limited to a narrow command-economy focus. They invented the video game industry. The soviet's cutting edge computing experts were a handful of guys in the space program. The US spawned an entire industry that naturally produced thousands of experts. 

I think limited economies top-down like Iran can do a really good job excelling in a specific area, but you completely miss out on that organic bottom-up demand driven innovation. 

 Anyways, super interesting conversation.

Another potential issue is that there's not enough storage in Russia for all the oil they can't sell. How will they handle that? Most likely they'll have to shut-in oil wells. Doing that carries the risk that some of those oil fields will be unusable when they try to open them back up. 

Something I'm less certain about is the impact of foreign oil companies leaving Russia. Some of Russia's western oil fields are incredibly complex operations, and it was with good reason that Russia needed these companies' expertise.

&gt;If Europe cared that much about Ukraine they could’ve stopped Russian oil the day of the invasion.

&gt;The US (CIA) is notorious for interfering in elections.

But the CIA killed Allende in 1973 doesn't mean that Putin gets to launch a war and invade because he wanted to depose Zelensky.  I also think that the US rigging elections have been counterproductive in the past.  We really need to set up institutions in other countries that counter people's idiotic and populist choices in elections and ensure that wannabe authoritarians don't morph into dictators.  And steps can be taken short of invasion or rigging elections if authoritarians start dismantling democratic institutions like the courts like sanctions.  For instance, I think that Orban is setting up a dictatorship in Hungary but the right way to counter him would be kicking Hungary out of the EU and NATO and applying individual sanctions, not a war.

There's no evidence of any Ukrainian counter-offensives at Izyum. Even ISW (who display extreme Ukrainian bias) have stated that there is no evidence of any such counter-attack.

I dispute this, but nonetheless it isn't about territory so much as it's about manpower. The AFU is getting ground to dust by Russian artillery, air power, and night SF raids. Hundreds of AFU personnel are getting killed every day for very few Russian losses, it's unsustainable at this rate.

Also regarding oil production, while you are right about demand, there are a lot of reasons to limit supply. Even the Arabs aren't producing more to capitalize on the price. While Russian oil is harder to scale up and down quickly, that's still likely a factor. All things considered, Russia is making more money off this war with respect to oil and before.

And I am personally not too confident about the technological issues. While it's true Russia lacks a lot technologically in many ways, these types of actions backfire dramatically. China was completely embargoed from everything, including fertilizers (as they were starving from Mao sanctions) and food, while it practically an agrarian country. And yet today... They had reached a decent domestic industrial base by 80s, enough to sustain their stratospheric growth later.

Iran was practically a semi feudal country that's been subject to insane sanctions on all their technology and they are still building relatively advanced ballistic missiles, drones, ATGMS, etc. Of course, many are copies, many have issues but for all intents and purposes they are pretty much impregnable short of a total invasion. Russia is significantly more advanced than Iran or 1970 China and more importantly, borders China. There is currently very limited sino Russian technological corporation - how this could pan out remains a very important question for the West, especially if you consider aerospace.

Wait.  And you are okay with another country just deciding to invade one day?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The only reason Ukraine is getting so much support is that the better Ukraine does the weaker Russia will be.

Ukraine is mainly getting support because Zelensky is charismatic and likable and it is a European country getting bombed.  Kyiv is a very European city, so it is easy for people to imagine that they themselves are getting bombed and shot at.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;There could have been a peaceful solution to this. Russia could’ve been given guarantees that Ukraine would not pose a strategic risk to Russia. But NATO pushed Ukraine into this too.

Yeah, I'd wish that NATO could just say Ukraine cannot join and Putin would leave but the issue is that isn't the main reason why Putin invade.  Putin was angry that the Ukrainians got rid of his corrupt puppet in 2014 and thinks that he has the right to reinstall him as dictator.  He doesn't want to respect the electoral choices of Ukrainians and their right to have their own democracy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Why fight Russia if someone else is willing to do it? I know you’re thinking this is outrageous and Russia is the aggressor and it’s not fair but this is just the way it has been for centuries and the way it will always be.

I'm not sure why you think NATO was itching to fight Russia.  In fact, NATO and the West have been tiptoeing around Putin's many war crimes for over a decade including Georgia, Syria, and Ukraine (2014) because of Russia's nuclear stockpile.  It's just that a full-scale invasion of a European country because the aging dictator wanted to depose the democratically elected government and reinstall his corrupt puppet, Yanukovych, as dictator was a bridge too far.

My biggest concern about Russia pivoting to the East as far as energy exports is I'm not confident that all the Western Oil fields will still be online by the time any pipeline to China is built. If Russia cannot find a market for those products, they only have so much storage, there is a real risk that they may have to shut-in some of those fields, and unfortunately once those fields are shut down, it's not a simple manner to bring them back online, and some of them may never be recovered. The longer they have to be shut-in, the higher the risk.

We can see that with the Covid fall in demand; Russia oil production still hasn't recovered to pre-pandemic levels. The longer the shut-in, the higher the risk.

Currently the US exports 8% of the worlds crude oil. If oil prices hit $170 a barrel, which I think is possible if western Russian oil is unable to reach the world market, there will be a ton of political pressure on Biden. One of the easiest solutions (because it won't require congressional approval) for him is to implement an oil export ban. 

You take already sky high oil prices and remove an additional 8% of the available crude, and we could see oil prices in excess of $200 a barrel. Oil at that price would be catastrophic for most nation's economies. Like poorer countries having to deindustrialize catastrophic, and severe recession for the wealthier countries. 

The US before the Shale revolution has always been a net importer of oil, so for most modern history they've always been in the position of throwing their geopolitical weight toward lower global oil prices. 

Now Biden is the position where he can protect Americans from that economic pain at the expense of the rest of the world (US Oil prices in the export ban scenario would be aprox. $70 a barrel).

[],False,,ChiknHug,,,,,,"Not necessarily true, though your points do have merit.

While your first point does make sense, I think you’re missing my general point here, that being China is a consistent economic power. More or less in the same way that China consistently has made empires. In general China’s economic prominence in world affairs has repeated itself(for over a thousand years as mentioned), and is doing so(likely) again.

As for the second point, I feel like that’s a rather reductive answer. Of course a while ago circumstances were different. But the logistics involved in shifting away the West from China would be monstrous, and would potentially plunge governments either flip-flopping on the issue or simply not dedicated enough on moving production elsewhere into political bedlam. I mean, up to a few decades ago, India wasn’t considered important, and even as a more modern case Japan and Korea’s explosion of soft power is a relatively recent phenomenon(more so in Korea’s case). My basic point isn’t that the West can’t survive without China, because it obviously can, but that as it stands it’s very much intrinsically linked to China.

I’d also say your last point is very compelling, but China’s trade with the West isn’t for its survival only. Of course it brings economic prosperity but as you said the West trades with China mostly for convenience. What would happen if the West started bringing manufacturing back home? Besides a stronger sense of nationalism and damaging China’s markets it would still suffer greatly from the costs involved and the likely political/economic unrest involved. I can assure you that most Western folk would not take too kindly to working in the same conditions as most Chinese factories; hell, most people from Europe and America can’t stomach working conditions in Japan, which are relatively light in comparison to China. China’s markets don’t entirely depend on the West; I’d argue that if the West was out of the picture China would turn more to the Asian economies. Already SEAN is a large trading partner, as is Korea. This could easily be upscaled if China needed to. If the West stopped trading with China it’s not like China would suddenly collapse. Both sides would feel the pain, just like when Trump started a trade war with China. I’d actually argue that the US got off worse because of that.

China doesn’t need the West to survive. It can survive on its own; I mean, it has for centuries. The West, however, does need China or another entity willing to do its production for it cheaply in order to keep up their standards of living. We’re already feeling that burn here in the US with the cost of things rising with no end in sight, and that’s with trade with China and the rest of the world prospering. On a side note I’d argue our current American declining economy isn’t necessarily related to China but I think you get my general point.

If anything China’s lack of economic power in the 20th century was an exception, not the norm. Again, unless the West can really get a foothold in Asia with Indian cooperation, China will eventually surpass the US and perhaps the EU too. Depending on who you ask it already has surpassed the EU, so I’d say that China can’t exactly be smashed like a weak country.",6101a8520ace39e465b0df2b8fb2deb358116eea,True,False,,,,,0,1652062312,,0,{},i7ve45c,False,t3_ukqqut,False,True,t1_i7vclcq,/r/geopolitics/comments/ukqqut/as_the_future_of_china_is_unclear_would_a_world/i7ve45c/,1652062325,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1652033512.0,[],text,t2_8jmzqkzr,False,False,

As sad as it is it’s reality, we can sit and talk morals, sovereignty, evilness all day but Russia would never let Ukraine fall in the west’s sphere of influence.

Russia could’ve been given guarantees that Ukraine would not pose a strategic risk to Russia. But NATO pushed Ukraine into this too. Why fight Russia if someone else is willing to do it? I know you’re thinking this is outrageous and Russia is the aggressor and it’s not fair but this is just the way it has been for centuries and the way it will always be.

India was a major replacement for Ukrainian and Russia wheat. It's okay for now, but the current heat wave raises doubts. 

How do you propose the transiberan railroad would be sabotaged? The Chinese consolidation of Xinjiang is partially for this purpose. Russia doesn't have that many issues in the far east. And any actual military attacks in this area would potentially turn into major nuclear escalation assuming they can get past air defenses - after all, you would be striking deep into China and Russia. Destabilizing central Asia is a tactic but the Russians stopped the Kazakhstan color revolution. 

And in general, the Russia China border will receive massive investments over the next few years especially, which would make sabotage harder. Despite the memes of debt traps, most Chinese investments in Africa are for money - there remains no question that the Chinese will likely get significantly greater returns (monetarily and security wise) from Russia, which is now effectively banished from the west. 

Russia and China have already announced a new major pipeline that unifies the European and Chinese gas fields (in Russia, the European gas supply and Chinese gas supply were from different, disconnected fields and so couldn't be substituted - this will change with Power Of Siberia 2 pipeline coming online in 3 years). Add to this LNG ports and terminals all of which could also be used to supply India, South East Asia, Japan, etc (which increases their potential return on investments). This is the key dynamic i believe most commentators miss out, regarding Russia's economic prospects - the world isn't dynamic, Europe and the West are stagnating demand markets (for energy), while Asia is going to only be more and more thirsty for hydrocarbons. I believe this is the real wager Putin has made - Asia over Europe.

And finally, regarding the coal plants, they are generally very easy to bring online quickly.

Hell, they don’t even care what government you have so long as the cash flows so I think ‘wars of liberation’ and the like will be far less common under a Chinese hegemony.

If anything China may go for some territorial concessions in the West simply because they have a chip on their shoulder from the Century of Humiliation but even then, I think that’s a huge stretch.",3680042907a8063543f8213b08254f9609dade46,True,False,,,,,0,1652056125,,0,{},i7v1ndu,False,t3_ukqqut,False,False,t1_i7ra62z,/r/geopolitics/comments/ukqqut/as_the_future_of_china_is_unclear_would_a_world/i7v1ndu/,1652056141,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1652027325.0,[],text,t2_8jmzqkzr,False,False,

[],False,,ChiknHug,,,,,,"I think I’d like to politely disagree on this point. The US sphere does have a lot of sway but I think what makes the difference is that the US is so, so inconsistent when it comes to its politics. Trump nearly alienated us from a good chunk of our allies and others have done the same before. The lack of consistency when it comes to a clear American objective with its Allies is a great weakness. In general America’s political system lets it pivot out of bad thing faster than most other nations but also lets it pivot out of good things, which can be very very harmful.

I think China’s sway over nations around the world shouldn’t be understated, especially as Africa and Asia will have population booms which could help offset Chinese demographic decline if immigration becomes popular. In particular Chinese influence with SEA nations could help to usher in a decline of U.S. influence in the region, and they already have quite a good amount of influence over the only two real dependable, strong allies of the US, Japan and Korea.

China also doesn’t have half bad relations with the EU though I don’t think it can really hold a candle to America in that regard, especially as the relationships there are deteriorating.

Honestly I think Western media, and just media in general downplays China’s influence in poorer countries just because, well, they’re poor. In reality these areas are important precisely because there’s no real Western influence there. If China succeeds in its endeavors it could have sway over potentially half, if not more, of the world population.

The only way in my opinion that the West can actually influence China’s future is to have a sympathetic ally in India, which already isn’t exactly on super friendly terms with the West as a whole. China’s power likely will grow mostly unabated as the US declines and faces internal unrest, and this power will only grow as poorer countries which China influences continue to grow in power.",8c435381da364a2581ec8fe261360eed62538ed9,True,False,,,,,0,1652055809,,0,{},i7v10g5,False,t3_u8nqc8,False,True,t1_i5nee6k,/r/geopolitics/comments/u8nqc8/the_return_of_statecraft_back_to_basics_in_the/i7v10g5/,1652055834,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1652027009.0,[],text,t2_8jmzqkzr,False,False,
