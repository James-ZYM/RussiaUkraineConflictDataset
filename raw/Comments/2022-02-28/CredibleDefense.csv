The ""Putin wants to reform the soviet union"" argument is as much a western media ""red scare returns"" way of framing the logic, as it is from Russia's own media trying to sell a return to glory and prominence for Russia. They are not a communist country, nor does Putin appear to have any intention of making them one.  


The lack of easily defensible land borders Russia has always struggled with all the way back to it's imperial days, something it has always sought to counter by gobbling up as much of a land buffer into Europe as it can manage.  


You could just as easily say that Putin is trying to rebuild the Tsarist image of the Russian Empire, but you wouldn't, because it doesn't have the international cultural cache or induction of fear like ""The Soviet Union"" does.  


Everything else Russia has done in Ukraine is just about destroying any potential for Ukraine to build oil and gas wealth that could destabilise Russia's attempts to be the main supplier of energy to the EU. The same reason why NATO still exists - to stop Russia's energy resources from bringing the EU closer to Russian influence and further from the US influence.

&amp;#x200B;

Given their needs in the situation, the more important outcome for Russia is simply seizing and slowing Ukrainian energy proliferation and stopping the US from having a NATO nation parked right at Russia's front door.  


Neither of those two moves require the total annexation of Ukraine. Russia is barely even successfully holding onto Crimea, it's costing them dearly just to pay to prop its industry up.

- Kiev is a very large city, almost 3M people pre-war. Many have left of course by now but many have not, and people from the surrounding countryside and the eastern areas may have fled *to* Kiev to escape the Russian advances.

- The Russians would actively try to prevent planes from flying over or near the city or their forces. This would be very dangerous for the supply planes, which are not usually meant to fly in contested airspace. Some sort of SEAD and/or fighter escorts would be necessary, but of course this would be the dreaded NATO-Russia shooting war that everyone is trying to avoid.

- Having friendly planes in the sky could confuse and distract Ukrainian air defenses. Although Russia has the air warfare advantage, the Ukrainians still operate some air defense systems in and around Kiev. But on a radar screen friendly and enemy planes can look very similar, and active anti-air missiles could track the wrong targets even if fired at correct enemy targets.

I was totally agreeing with you with everything till that last part. They will have to rethink their strategy (and seem to be doing so), but then they should be capable of quite a bit more than that.

They were going to quickly, to haphazardly and were way to dismissive of the resistance they would face. That should be changing right now. Most of their forces haven't seen combat yet. And if they are taking the time that their supply lines need and then assault with some coordination, they should be able to punch much harder than we've seen so far. They are certainly now taking their time to assemble around Kiyv and prior engagements have been much smaller than what is looming there. If they do not skimp on artillery and air support this time, I am not seeing a successful Ukrainian resistance.

And there are reports that the Ukrainians have suffered quite devastating losses in the South, so they may not be able to resist very effectively there for some time. 

(All that said, their biggest problem remains. Nobody seems to be able to see a long-term objective that makes sense in the face of Ukrainian resistance. Surely any puppet regime installed in Kiyv would garner no support and face opposition that would require Russian occupation forces... but that's the politcal long-term).

https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-february-28-2022

We’ve seen a dangerous turn of events here, especially in Kharkiv. Russia seems to have abandoned the restrained use of fire support we saw during the opening days of the war and now seems likely to overcome Ukrainian resistance along the Kharkiv axis of attack. Russia seems intent to continue major offensives now and it’s likely their operational pause will stop in the next 24 hours and they will continue major operations in the 48-72 hours afterwards. The Crimea axis of attack remains dangerous and threatens to isolate many of Ukraine’s forces in eastern Ukraine if they do not withdraw in the coming days.

&gt; The next major phase of Russian offensive operations will likely begin within the next 24 hours and play out over the ensuing 48-72 hours.

…

&gt; **The Russian use of heavy artillery against urban areas indicates a dangerous new phase in Russian operations**. ISW previously warned that Russian forces would likely need to increase their use of air and artillery assets to overcome heavier-than-expected Ukrainian resistance but that Russia refrained from doing so to limit the informational and diplomatic effects of causing heavy Ukrainian civilian casualties and to avoid creating rubble and other obstacles-to-movement into and through Ukrainian cities. Russian forces will likely be able to overcome Ukrainian defenses in Kharkiv (and in Kyiv, if they choose to apply similar firepower there) while inflicting heavy civilian casualties and doing massive property damage.

…

&gt; Russian forces advancing north and east from Crimea threaten to cut off Ukrainian forces in eastern Ukraine if Kyiv does not withdraw them in the coming days.

&gt; Russian forces face growing morale and supply issues but will likely be able to overcome these handicaps.

In some ways this feels like the kind of non-planning plan that was more about keeping Putin happy and the defense staff closest to him in their jobs.

Western analysts seem to have got on the same page of seeing the Russian war plan as decisively shaped by Putin's concern for avoiding the sparking of a Ukrainian Resistance **[UR].**

This plan has failed to the point of making a UR incredibly credible. That is why IMO the past 5 days are a strategic level defeat for Russia.

I believe if the 48h Russian war plan had gone off successfully (Zelensky, Hostomel etc) any discussion of a UR would be pure western cope. It just would have vanished into thin air in a couple days like other Western fantasies of an ""Afghan National Government.""

Even now I agree with those who are skeptical of a UR insofar as, if Putin could push a button and make Ukraine capitulate now, no UR would happen. The national identity they are forging is too much based in euphoria and memes. It is the *Twitch Plays Pokémon* of nationalism not the real meat of a guerilla resistance.

The increasing credibility of a UR lies precisely in the fact that Putin does not have any such button he can push, he can only ""win"" the war with 10,000s of civilian casualties being broadcast to the outside world, either through massive shelling or starvation sieges or both. This horrible experience is what will firm up the UR. The sight of atrocities and mass killings on the border of EU like they have not seen since the Bosnian War is what will firm up the Western determination to support a rump Ukrainian state in the west.

But aside from the increasing bloodiness of the war, maybe the biggest strategic Russian problem is that they have lost all credibility in Western eyes as a threat to conquer *the entirety* of Ukraine and prevent the emergence of that rump state. Can you imagine these Russian forces fighting in Lviv or the Carpathians? Can you imagine Russian logistics supplying such a force? If it is true that Putin's army can still achieve this, he will have to prove it in real life, he can no longer merely threaten it. IMO this is the #1 reason why Putin's janissary in Belarus has been thrown into the fray. 

Long story short: the war is not going according to Ukraine's advantage, but it is precisely the foreclosing of the ""least terrible"" ways Putin can win, and the foreclosing of any credible conquest of the entire Ukraine, that makes the past 5 days a strategic defeat for Russia's plans to conquer and govern part of the country.",f0a5381cf001853c10fe0fda1cefa02cffa9c0f7,True,False,,,,,0,1646086797,,0,{},hyu49e9,False,t3_t3fpvo,False,True,t3_t3fpvo,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t3fpvo/ukraine_megathread_february_28/hyu49e9/,1646086807,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646057997.0,

I don't think it's cut-and-dry enough to say that the US actually lost either of those wars. Going by our initial objectives, both were successful -- regime change happened quickly, and eventually we got both Saddam and Osama.

We definitely failed at ""nation building"" Afghanistan into a reliable Western ally. However, the Taliban government has been actively fighting against domestic terrorism, which is quite an improvement over the pre-2001 Taliban. If our objectives were to 1) get Osama bin Laden, and 2) prevent international terrorism from originating in Afghanistan, we've apparently done it.

It's harder to say definitively that nation building failed in Iraq. ISIS was a big fuckup on our part, but that's largely dealt with. We still have 12 bases in Iraq, the economy is improving, and we both officially consider each other ""strategic partners.""

&gt; Except for heavy shelling around Kharkiv, use of fires have been limited compared to how the Russian mil typically operates. Sadly, I think this will change. Russian mil is an artillery army first, and it has used a fraction of its available fires in this war thus far. /16

&gt; The bulk of the Russian military has yet to enter the fight. Outside Kharkiv, most of the 1st Guards Tank Army, and 20th Army, are just sitting there. They pushed a few BTGs a considerable distance past Sumy, but I think a lot of Russia's forces are still on the sidelines. /17

Why did Moscow choose this course of action? A few theories: they didn’t take Ukraine &amp; its military seriously. They wanted to avoid attrition &amp; devastation because of consequences for pol goals in Ukraine, costs of casualties, and they want to hide the costs from the public. 3/

It is also possible that Russian military planners genuinely wanted to avoid inflicting high levels of destruction given how unpopular this war was going to be at home. Most Russian soldiers are young &amp; have little interest in fighting Ukrainians as an opponent. 4/

What I’ve seen so far suggests that Russian troops were unaware they would be ordered to invade, and appear reluctant to prosecute this war. They don't see Ukrainians as adversaries and the military didn’t prepare them for this campaign. Outside of Chechens, morale seems low. 5/

Beyond large numbers of units strewn out in small detachments &amp; checkpoints, we have the inverse situation as well. Long trains of Russian vehicles stuck in their own traffic jams, entering across the border. Air defenses not covering them, but stuck on the road with them. 10/

As companies &amp; platoons run ahead to seize points, logistics can’t keep up, and they’re not being effectively covered by support. Most of the fights I've seen are small skirmishes, especially on the outskirts of major cities. These may be intense, but not major battles. 11/

The Russian failure is driven by the fact that they’re attempting to conduct a full-scale invasion without the mil operation that it would require, thinking they can avoid most of the fighting.

The CNA or Center for Naval Analysis is about as legit a source of intelligence as we can get in the open source world. And this individual has been covering Russia professionally for years before this war broke out. 

In fact he was one of the leading voices sounding the alarm of the coming Russian invasion for months. He called it right and was slandered by Russian propaganda for his efforts which we now know as being 100% correct. 

His twitter account has been incredibly informative to follow and I encourage anyone with a desire for knowledge in this area to read follow his content.

Russian GDP is 1.4 trillion. 15% of 1.4 trillion is about 200 billion. Chinese GDP is 14.7 trillion. 200 billion is a little over 1% of Chinese GDP.

Assuming the accuracy of this video, I’d argue that the intended action in Ukraine is one of destabilisation at a lower cost to Russia’s overall military capability over using their full might to pursue a rapid victory which would show the hand of their full force.

The interest is much more in destroying Ukrainian infrastructure and securing their resources, as well as the “breakaway” regions.

They’ve seemingly successfully set Ukraine back developmentally a substantial amount of time, ensuring that Ukrainian energy reserves can’t be scaled up to compete with them, and have ensured that at least short term nato expansion is a no go.

Even if Ukraine joins the EU it shouldn’t be too much of a threat to the desired port, oil and territorial buffer gains they have made, assuming EU acceptance for Ukraine wouldn’t automatically contest the annexed regions.

Aside from the fact that Russia has no seemingly tanked their own economy, Putin has achieved all of what are assumed to be his goals in this conflict without showing Russias true military capability. 

Also the relatively strong defence the Ukrainians have put up to the scaled down Russian force could be used as a false example of the threat to Russian loyalists in Ukraine that Putin has been selling domestically and abroad.",9247f5c7b7f5845b0da27ad5f23d49a90388db8e,True,False,,,,,0,1646075087,,0,{},hyta6hj,False,t3_t3jwpe,False,True,t1_hyszz97,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t3jwpe/the_mysterious_case_of_the_missing_russian_air/hyta6hj/,1646075103,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646046287.0,

It seems that my confusion about the impact of losing a 1000 soldiers is because, while their losses have likely had a significant effect on the kinds of operations they are capable of, the switch to besieging an entrenched urban force across long supply lines vulnerable to enemy strongholds leaves Russia in a military situation that the force they built up was likely never capable of.

You have spent a great deal of time already and I have learned a ton. I would love to hear your opinion on what Russia might do now that they are attempting an operation which is likely beyond the capabilities of the force they have assembled. Do they abandon the siege of Kiev and try to settle for capturing the coast from Crimea to Donbass? Do they bring in a larger force, presumably including hardware that has been surprisingly absent so far (such as their 3000 plane Air Force)? Or simply fix up their supply-lines and logistics failures, bring in a ton of supplies, and attempt to lay siege to the city? 

Based on what you’ve said so far it seems Russia has to change the game to move forward.

Ukraine actually has a pretty good tech sector.  

From: https://wearebrain.com/blog/innovation-and-transformation-strategy/why-ukraine-is-the-silicon-valley-of-europe/

&gt; Upwork, the world’s leading online freelance site, ranks Ukraine as the third best place in the world to find people with advanced tech and IT skills. 

That's pretty good. That doesn't necessarily speak to their cyber *security* sector, but if they have tech chops in general, there's reason to believe they have their share of IT security people as well.

That said, there is this:

https://www.trade.gov/market-intelligence/ukraine-cybersecurity-assistance

&gt; Ukraine has been under frequent cyber attacks by external hackers in the wake of the conflict in the east. According to a study published in 2018 by British tech research firm Comparitech, it is one of the least cyber secure countries. The study claims Ukraine to be the 10th least cyber-secure out of 60 countries researched — slightly more secure than Iran, and slightly less than Nigeria. In 2018, about 28 percent of Ukrainian computers and 11 percent of phones were infected with malware.

&gt; The major cybersecurity issues in Ukraine:

&gt; •    Inefficient legislation and management system

&gt; •    Low level of cyber-attack response 

&gt; •    Lack of public and private partnership

[],False,,Norseman2,,,[],,,,text,t2_36zfy,False,False,"&gt;Ukraine is putting up a tougher fight than expected. Will they “win”? No. 

It's still not clear that that's true. Ukraine getting fighter jets from the EU and lethal aid even from Germany signifies a major turning point in the war. If we compare this to the Vietnam War:

* Population: ~41 M (Ukraine, Jan 2022) vs. ~23.8 M (North Vietnam, 1974).

* Size of local opposition forces: 1.211M (Ukrainian armed forces + paramilitary + reserves) vs. 0.89M (Vietcong + NVA circa 1966-1968)

* Major power troops committed (peak): ~120-180K (Russian soldiers in Ukraine) vs. 543K (US soldiers in Vietnam, 1969)

* Local allied forces: ~34K (Donetsk and Luhansk Republic forces) vs. 850K (Army of the Republic of Vietnam, 1968).

So basically, Russia is invading a country with twice the population and about 36% more defenders than we faced in Vietnam, and they're trying to do it with a military force about 1/4 to 1/3 as large as the force we committed to Vietnam at the peak, along with less than a tenth as many local supporters. On top of that, they're using a lot of old Soviet 1980s-era technology, while the Ukrainians are being given modern Javelin missiles, NLAWs, and now European fighter jets, and looking at a likely $6.4B in further US military aid if Russia can't wrap this up quickly. 

With this comparison, the losses Russia has faced over the last five days are not all surprising. Their only significant relative advantage in Ukraine is that their supply lines are considerably shorter than ours were in Vietnam. Of course, as this article points out, they didn't prepare adequate logistical support for this kind of operation, and Ukraine is taking advantage of that, hindering their operations by targeting their supply vehicles. It seems quite plausible that, given their circumstances, this could end worse for Russia than the Vietnam war did for us. Ukraine winning and retaking their entire country remains a significant possibility.

For Russia to get the same manpower ratios as we had in Vietnam, they would need to commit about 1.9M troops, or the entirety of their active duty forces and about half of their reserves. They would also need to be able to manage the logistics for a force that large which would likely require appropriating civilian transport vehicles for military use. If they try that, they would likely run into the same problems that we ran into in Vietnam. We could expect drafted soldiers to have low morale and possibly fragging commanders who are too eager to fight, along with enormous anti-war protests at home as the casualties mount. And all of this would be just to get up to the same ratio of allied forces to enemy forces that we still lost with in Vietnam. This is far from an easy or certain fight for Russia.",34af515e83a9b73bd0feefde3a8360083c074647,True,False,,,,,0,1646069331,,0,{},hysv0yr,False,t3_t34ayd,False,True,t1_hyrsy87,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t34ayd/logistics_vulnerabilities_builtin_to_russian/hysv0yr/,1646069346,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646040531.0,

- locating bin Laden (also deserves to be mentioned because of the extreme security measures from the host country. One guy in the ISI knew where he was)
-Soviet Afghanistan (it's dumbass to blame the CIA for the rise of the Taliban afterwards. They were told to make  Afghanistan untenable for the Soviets. That was the extent of their mission. See comments on policymakers.)
-Stuxnet virus
-operation Rubicon
-feeding bad industrial gas tech to the Russians, resulting in the 1982 gas pipeline explosion in Tobolsk and crippling Soviet gas export for years
-recruiting researchers inside Kremlin archives
-Stealing a Soviet jet fighter, flying it to the US, testing it, and returning it without the soviets knowing it was gone (remarkable because of the technical difficulty of the operation)
-Operation QRHelpful
-Operation Gold (successful and technically brilliant, just blown by a British mole)
-recent successful extraction of Afghani citizens
-recent successful and accurate projections of Putin's actions in Ukraine (fake chemical attack, fake bombing, intent to invade)

 A scenario that would likely play out:  a large scale nuclear attack on would likely take down the electric grid.  There is the threat of nukes used as EMPs, but you also have intentional targeting of power plants, and the large scale destruction of substations and transmission lines that would invariably happen.  This wouldn't just be a rolling brown out scenario, this is lights go out and no telling when they come back on.

Guess what relies on the electric grid?  Gas.  Without electricity, gas stations go offline and even worse the pipelines moving the gas go out.  Now what happens?  We can't transport food.  

What else relies on the electric grid?  Clean water after what ever is stored in towers (gravity fed to houses) is used.  

Then without electricity, all non-perishable food goes on the clock to spoil within weeks (or less).  You also have to resort to making fire to cook your core non-perishables (rice, pasta, etc).  


Within a few month the calendar is rolled back 200 years.  What percentage of the population can find their own food and water within a month or two of losing all electricity?  Not too many.

Your argument amounts to coincidence, the 2014 annexation of Crimea was a result of events totally unconnected to who was US President at the time. Why did he wait till 2022 to follow up those plans? There could be hundreds of reasons, it could be logistical, it could be influenced by other events, it could be he was waiting till Syria was over, it could be Covid.

We'll also very likely start on an EW variant of the Eurofighter instead of going with Growlers to fully replace the Tornado. Drones (both recon and combat) are also very likely. Transport/multipurpose helicopters as well, the NH90 is kind of a shitshow. Maybe logistics aircraft; I can see springing for more A400s and maybe even a few more A330 MRTTs, but I'm not sure how required that is atm.

On the Navy side, the most likely candidate for serious money are the subs. Maybe a few surface assets as well (the dream would be a bunch of Aegis destroyers, but that's, well, a dream). Patrol aircraft would definitely be on the list (P-8).

Army-wise, our tanks are fine but we need to stock up on spare parts. AFVs/IFVs I don't know. Artillery could use some expansion. AA _definitely_ needs expansion. The unmitigated disaster that is the Tiger needs to be replaced ASAP with a platform that can actually do _any_ useful job while preferably being less maintenance-intensive than the frigging Space Shuttle.

That's the obvious big-ticket items. Cross-service, a lot of money will need to be spent on ammo/ordnance, especially ATGMs and MANPADS but also smaller-scale stuff (I'd expect the G36 replacement to be fast-tracked now, less because the G36 is supposedly shit and more because more guns = better). And training, training, training.

Things that won't happen:

- Anything involving nuclear, be it weapons or propulsion.

- Aircraft carriers or amphibs.

- Strategic bombers.

- Massive expansion in airframe types (F-35A + Eurofighter are the most likely outcome; I can't see the BW looking at stuff like F-15s or similar).

The real question, though, is how much of this money actually gets translated into useful equipment (and how quickly) without trickling away in the bureaucracy. The fact is that the BW's budget pre-February was more than acceptable even when factoring in the comparatively high pay; UK and France do much more with less or similar funding levels. But the titanic bureaucracy that is military acquisition in Germany actually makes the US MIC look like an agile startup by comparison.

This next makes me wonder if Russia kicked this operation off using few of their modernized armor units.  Partly due to hubris, figuring a large show of force would overwhelm the Ukrainians, and maybe partly as a strategy to let older and more ""disposable"" armor units absorb Ukrainian ATGMs and potentially deplete their supply.  Then they move in with their high-value modernized armor units.  This keeps attrition of expensive and harder to replace modern tanks and APCs to a minimum, and in addition to depleting Ukrainian ATGMs, the Ukrainian defenders will be lulled into a false sense of security about where its safe to ambush armored vehicles.  When the modernized armor with updated sensor technology hits the battlefield, the Ukrainian defenders will be exposed and vulnerable.

I always thought it was dubious for Russia, which has spent a lot of time/money modernizing their army, to risk attrition of these forces on a large scale on this kind of military goal.  It's not clear how soon/fast their economy can replace these modernized assets, especially over the near term where economy may still be reeling from sanctions and other economic effects.

[],False,,OneCatch,,,[],,,,text,t2_11e3n3,False,False,"&gt;AT4 and M72 LAW are clear examples of light AT systems. Very simple to use, cheap, and disposable light AT weapons used to deal with light targets.  

They're used for that *nowadays* because armour has improved. But - like the Dragon - when they were introduced they were capable of penetrating the armour of their likely foes. The M72 can penetrate 200mm of RHA which is enough to penetrate a T55 frontally from several angles and more than enough for the sides. The AT-4 - when introduced - could penetrate the T-72 from certain frontal hits and most side hits. Not all that different to the position the Pzf3 is in in relation to cutting edge armour today - but in 20 years the Pzf3 won't turn into a light AT weapon just because it can no longer frontally penetrate the unobtanium amour of 2040!


&gt;Maybe we use different definitions.  

I think we do and, with respect, I think mine is the more widely recognised one.  

If an AT weapon can be carried by a single person, can be fired by a single person, can be fired from kneeling or standing and at various angles, doesn't require a tripod, doesn't have active guidance, doesn't weight very much, has a range much shorter than armoured combat vehicles - it is more likely to be considered a light AT weapon.  

If it is requires a tripod or other equipment setup, to be fired from prone, has multi-km range, has some form of active guidance or homing, is broken into two or more parts for transport, is too heavy for one person to practically carry, it's more likely to be considered a heavy AT weapon.  

Some straddle the definition. For example, the NLAW has most of the attributes of a light weapon, but does have a top-attack mode and a guidance system. On balance I'd consider it a light AT weapon because it's doctrinal use is similar to that of an AT-4 or a Pzf3 - taking out armoured vehicles at relatively close range - and because its guidance system isn't doesn't allow active correction.  


Personally, if I were coming up with the definitions I'd add a 'medium' category in order to distinguish between stuff which needs a tripod and is therefore firmly crew served (Milan, Konkurs, Spike) and stuff which doesn't (Javelin, RBS 56)! But that's just my personal view - the heavy/light distinction I've outlined above is the most accepted one.",9877efa9aa3b0a606a4cbb81534532a064f166cd,True,False,,,,,0,1646048117,,0,{},hyrm5g4,False,t3_t2nqt7,False,True,t1_hyrjk5y,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t2nqt7/germanys_1000_antitank_weapons_and_500_stinger/hyrm5g4/,1646048134,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646019317.0,

Oil is on the decline and replaced more and more by gas. Modern heat pumps are only used for a small number of newly built ones (usually upper class homes) and can't be used for existing old buildings because they need very energy efficient architecture to be warm in the winter plus its also usually more expensive. Can't be done by just renovating the old buildings either as that does not increase energy efficiency enough in the majority of existing buildings.

To meet the political demands to be CO2 neutral by 2045/50 GER would basically have to demolish most of its existing housing and construct new efficient ones.
GER is building only 100k-300k homes a year with a total pool of 20 million. And most of these aren't even the highest energy efficiency class and still get heating with natural gas installed.

Another solution would be electric heating like in France but for that the electricity price would need to be much lower and the total electricity output increased big time.

None of that is going to happen and even if theoretical solutions exist GER is not able to build enough infrastructure for such drastic changes in small amount of times gas heating will be around for decades. LNG and hydrogen aren't sole solutions either as the availability will be very small compared to what is required.

China's economy is growing rapidly, they have 4x the population of the US so they only need 1/4th the GDP per capita to match the US, they're military quickly increasing in size, Chinese companies are quickly rising up the value chain, moving from creating knockoff products to innovating.

Russia on the other hand, has a smaller population than the US, there hasn't been much to indicate they'll indicate their economy will overtake the US, their industries don't seem to be rising up the value chain like China's is.

[],False,,MisterBanzai,,,[],,,,text,t2_161z7d,False,False,"&gt; Yet I still do not follow how the loss of a 1000 can signal that we may be on the last offensives of a campaign that included 200,000. Can you help me understand how we're estimating the impact of this on Russia's remaining force capability?

I think the trouble here is folks are looking at the raw numbers and asking, ""How is it possible that a 99% intact force might be operationally incapable?"" The real question should be, ""What strategy did Russia that would allow a 200k force to ever be sufficient in the first place?""

By that I mean, on the face on things, Russia's attack on Ukraine was actually a pretty daring one. Russia was going to be attacking a force of approximately the same size (in personnel) with another quarter million personnel in reserve. On top of that, their forces would be spread out across a massive area and would need to maintain security across a number of major metropolitan areas. Essentially, from a pure manning perspective, Russia was going to enter this fight outnumbered and facing the risk of things bogging down into urban combat.

The Russian military seems to have made a number of assumptions here. They assumed that their superior equipment, initiative, the presence of force multipliers, and quickly obtaining air supremacy would enable them to perform a rapid decapitation strike on Kyiv and seize their operational objectives before Ukraine could ever mobilize its reserves. The risky air assault and airborne operations that Russia conducted on the Hostomel airport and Vasylkiv further support the notion that they meant to rapidly cut off the city and they didn't anticipate the need for force sustainment beyond a few days (for instance, there doesn't seem to have been any plan for how to link up with the paratroopers at Vasylkiv). The near constant reports of Russia saboteurs in Ukraine seem to indicate that Russia believed they could paralyze Ukraine's C2 apparatus, shut down their ability to effectively respond, and then Ukrainian forces would surrender piecemeal.

Instead, Russia failed to cut off Kyiv entirely. Most of Kyiv's east-west thoroughfares are still in Ukrainian hands, and Ukrainian leadership has capitalized on their excellent IO campaign to reinforce their nation's resolve. At the point, even if Kyiv were cut off, there's a fairly good chance that the other pockets of Ukrainian forces would continue to fight despite it. Even some of their low-risk assumptions, like obtaining air supremacy, have also managed to fail.

Even worse for Russia, Ukraine had time to mobilize their reserves and now Russia is seeing their true nightmare scenario play out. The one environment where Russia's force multipliers are least likely to be effective is in urban combat. This is also the same environment where Ukraine's light infantry reserves are most effective. This means that even if Russia does manage to do something like cut off Kyiv, that would no longer represent victory for them. That would only be the beginning of a manpower and materiel intensive siege. Given that their logistics planning didn't account for sustaining such a siege, it's also likely they lack the capacity to even do so without first taking some time to prepare for such a battle.

I've also noted that Russia seems to have lost of lot of critical and limited capabilities in this fighting too. The emphasis on bypassing urban areas and penetrating deep into Ukraine means that when fighting became prolonged and logistics convoys became necessary, those same convoys were having to attempt to penetrate deep past enemy held strongpoints. This means that Russia's already insufficient logistics capability has taken disproportionate losses. Some of these forces, like the assault bridging company I noted, are in very short supply to begin with (i.e. I don't know the full force structure of the invasion force, but I would be shocked if there are more than 10 bridging companies in the whole invasion force) and their loss completely precludes conducting certain kinds of operations.",500c2ad14ef2eb9779615eedc88a5d2d959fc755,True,False,,,,,0,1646039139,,0,{},hyrauu7,False,t3_t2zf5q,False,True,t1_hyr5rwz,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t2zf5q/how_much_of_ukraines_current_success_do_you_think/hyrauu7/,1646039156,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646010339.0,

And so he goes for the Warsaw Solution.  Because he has no other options.  
Ask yourselves what happens if that in turn is the threshold point for NATO entry to a 'humanitarian crisis' of self-affected ethnocide.  Brought on by these infantry weapons stinging just a little too much.  
Ask what happens if Putin vetoes that intervention with The Big Red Button.  And then says, 'Your field armies and airbases are dead.  Try that again, and no matter what else happens, 20 Topol-Ms will fall on the U.S. Eastern Seaboard, half an hour later.'  Completely bypassing 'Euro Unity' as a NATO condition.

Will NATO then fall back from an internal Russian matter?  Will Biden allow them to make a communal attack, with nuclear systems (noting we have no Pershing or Gryphon, tacticals will have to be flown in which means U.S. key control on B61s).  
Or will NATO fall to fragments as a function of 'But, but, Europe was always supposed to burn first...' American refusal to be the victim of dead Poles and Rumanians who are already past saving by Article V?  
If Putin is the mad dog the media are all pushing-the-same-cart saying he is, he will not hesitate to be the first rather than the last across the nuclear threshold.  Preemption to demonstrate or selectively intimidate/incapacitate has ALWAYS been an option within the Russian theater escalatory doctrine.

Reducing itself to a territorial army from 790,000 soldiers, 7,000 AFV, 6,000 MBT and 2,500 nuclear weapons.  Whoring their security to the world.  
This is madness because, if proper operational doctrine is executed, it will not gain Ukrainians their freedom vs. a professional Russian military.  It will only increase the duration of their pain.  
But it could easily take us to the threshold of a war, we don't want to be fighting in.  As an American, I \_resent this\_ and believe we should exit NATO, no matter what else happens, when this is done.  Because, less than thirty years after the CIS collapse, you Europeans are right back to slitting each other's throats with someone else' knife hand.",b5929a25cfb603bbbd3b6bd4cc8a238a57223f3d,True,False,,,,,0,1646038851,,0,{},hyrahdj,False,t3_t2nqt7,False,True,t1_hyrag3a,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t2nqt7/germanys_1000_antitank_weapons_and_500_stinger/hyrahdj/,1646038868,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646010051.0,

Russian artillery will assist with obscurant/incapacitant and suppression (cluster) strikes along any of these assault fronts and helicopters will likely move in with rapid assault forces to seize structures with multi-story overwatch on those lanes.  Probably at night.  When threats are asleep, after several days of preparatory bombardment kept  them up at all hours.  
Those structures which show signs of significant resistance to occupation or active hostile fire will be dropped, either by artillery or by bombing.  No questions asked.  
Does any of this sound like something a private individual with a single shot SLM/CCWS can aid with?  No?  Get the feeling you/they are being set up for a 'grand battle' cavalry rescue over streets filled with dead civilians yet?  
You Should.  You are being led by the nose.

In any case, once a lodgment has been made, and again assuming that Putin does not have time for an extended siege action; it is still unlikely that Kiev the urban metropolitan area will be seized as whole, perse.  Because that feeds the 'my life for dirt!' defender psychosis which leads to house-to-house nonsense.  As a game played, back and forth, by fools.  
And Pro Mil are not idiots when it comes to their chosen vocation.  It may be the only thing they are good at but they study their past failures endlesslessly and are /very good/ at defining tactical problems as 'Nopes' don't go theres.  
Instead, you will likely see a 'Candy Store' approach employed, using controlling terrain/structures points taken within the city which have dominant LOS position, overlooking key traffic lanes.  Anything moving on these lanes (food, water, orders, reinforcements, ammo, medevac) will be disrupted with air and artillery predominating.  
Again, with SVP-24 which is akin to a GLONASS corrected angle rate bombing system, you can get reasonable accuracies from well above any SLM envelope and response times from a nearby orbit will be in seconds.  \_If the IADS is down\_.  
Eventually, the Russian forces will move on key sites (Government House, Radio/Television/Rail/Subway nodes) to further the decapitation and strangulation/isolation effect, but these \_do not\_ have to be 'objective' gotta have goals.  Kiev itself is that.  
Rather, the point is to make the Ukrainians live with hopelessness.  
And then offer them conditional relief.  
Come to a common collection point, bring a weapon to prove you are an ex-combatant.  Accept a tattoo and a known-address ID card, and take home a bag of food.  The war, for you, is over.  Non consequences.  Your family needs you.  Play by the rules and we are not a threat to you and yours.  
Be discovered with another weapon, be discovered living someplace other than your home address, attempt to change sides or advocate/support continued combatancy and it's a no questions asked free blindfold and wall for you.  Show a simple willingness to get with the program and get back to a normal civilian existence and next week you can come back and get more food.  
You cannot understate how important this is.  With 2.88 million people, //even assuming half have fled//, a basal caloric requirement of 1,650 calories per day equates to 2,376,000,000 calories, evey day, just to keep everyone from falling into a starvation cycle of reduced activity as depression and stupor.  
The key point here is that the Russians don't have to pull a 1939 Warsaw conditioned fight (40,000 dead in 48hrs) as full bombardment to solve the 'Patriot's Arise!' problem in a way that is untennable for Zelensky in maintaining a continued defense against Russian objective capture.  
Don't have to be brutal to those who are not fighting at all.  They just have to divide them and let them sit, isolated in place, starving, in the dark and cold, collectively, without comms.  
Wondering if the world remembers them.  
When it comes time to advance, the Russians can be explicit in stating: 'If you live with bad neighbors, get away from the building because it's going to come down.'  And the very flood of responses will self-target structures for them.  
ROE for Russian soldiers should be simple: they have full freedom to self defend but upon spotting enemy combatants engaging other Russian forces their first response should be to maintain a contempt of engagement on all threats they can drive away to deny LOS on while calling in coordinates from other engagement systems that are not at risk.  
Backing up maneuver elements with organic MAVs and Divisional/Maneuver UAVs should be a given.  You want to pre-cue a defensive shortstop of threat ambush/approach to contact whenever possible.  But the emphatic truth must be, whereever the threat fire comes from, Russian casualties must be unequivocally retalliated for.  It cannot be for nothing.  
Even with AN/PAS-13 TWS sights and the almost certain presumption of Western SOF 'trainers' being the actual shooters; Stingers and Javelins will not help against massive numbers of UAVs, at night.  While, if the Russians have thermal or even LLTV on their drones, it could well mean that Russian soldiers, operating in darkness, will be dominant in defeating SLM/CCWS threats, even prelaunch, simply because they see them coming.  With this in mind, the Russian mastery of ESM/COMINT \_as a targeting system\_ from UAVs is such that you had better not go RF to talk about your fires coordination, because they will drop iron on your head for the arrogance.

And either drive around them or drop suppression fires on them, in the open.  Acting without mercy to communal (multistory) structures which house threat fire teams on or in them.  
  
ARGUMENT:  
The excitement and hysteria of 'gets you right here' heart tug is YOUR emotional response.  It is being fed to you as a voyeuristic thrill by all channels of the media.  Something which should rightly be vastly more terrifying than what is going on in Ukraine.  
You should rightly be more concerned with the in-depth truth on why (the end of Russian energy export dominance, something which is so serious it caused Blackwater to dump their U.S. energy stocks) saw this MRC be \_forced\_ into being, using the Munich Model.  
And which the 'we who are about to die, salute you!' types on the front lines in Ukraine are in no position to question as they spin themselves up to play at being soldiers in a martial action where there is no Pro-Am competition.  Only the dead and the experts.  
Let me repeat: \_We still do not know\_ why Putin is doing this.  
Why a reasonable man became so desperate as to risk this attack \_knowing\_ that it would be immediately spun into a counter-coup action against his administration as a consequence to massive punitive destabilization of his country.  Something which he undoubtedly saw coming because he is an expert in psychological warfare as subversion of threat state strategic/cultural opinions towards given outcomes/goals.  
Especially after decades of warning us what was coming if we kept backing out of treaties, setting up ABM sites and pushing NATO Eastwards.  Such a man is not a casual killer but he is still KGB and putting him in this corner where he literally is a handspan from nuclear release, is beyond contemptible, \_on our part\_.  
And thus, this is not a free high for you as it must be for the Ukrainians in the Capital.  They face their last hours with the giddyness of their lives not mattering.  You face the aftermath of a world which is pushing towards removal of the Russian superstate.  In which your elites already treat you like enemies (CRT, COVID Mandates, Colonization by foreign nationals unable to function in our society).  And absent an external threat, their contempt will turn ever more inwards, upon you.  
You know how evil our leaders are.  You have no excuse.  
The 'effectiveness' of man portable AD and top attack ATGW lies in how it convinces you to act without concern towards the greater strategic picture.  As though the committing high intensity weapons systems to foreign hands in escalating an OOTW fight to high intensity threshold was all that mattered.",4d542a9942a5f0016d2e76757bead2e21df02ec8,True,False,,,,,0,1646038823,,0,{},hyrag3a,False,t3_t2nqt7,False,False,t1_hyradus,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t2nqt7/germanys_1000_antitank_weapons_and_500_stinger/hyrag3a/,1646038835,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646010023.0,
[],False,,SmarmyBastuhd,,,[],,,,text,t2_hc3iezhw,False,False,"First, it's highly suspicious why Russian SOF, with Kredo-M GMTI and purchased Western thermals, are allowing these weapons to get through.  SR teams, in overwatch on highways and rail lines, should have long since begun interdicting these shipments (using HUMINT or overhead IMINT to type classify trucks and rail wagons).  Simply by jumping from a helicopter with an ATV type quad bike to rapidly drive away from any AEW track overwatch as a function of 'driving into the wilderness' which is Western Ukraine.  
Miles And Miles Of Nothing At All.  
If they don't want to gut NATO delivery boys with Kornet and similar ATGW of their own, the Russians should have destroyed bridges and rail lines (again, middle of nowhere targets. undefendable with SAMs) using Iskander and SVP-24 high altitude bombing.  Spetz know how to target for these as well, as readily as any other JTAC/CCTS capable SOF.  
Assuming the Ukrainian heavy IADS is destroyed, there is no reason not to begin the siege on Kiev from afar by denying them the weapons which equate to hope.  
The alternative, is that they /can't/ do this, because the weapons are in fact being delivered by CV-22s which are coming out of Rumania, Bulgaria or even Greece.  Which makes the video of 'unpacking from cargo aircraft in Poland' just another deceptive act of propaganda.  
Second, it's frankly bizarre to me why Putin has not targeted Ukrainian power and telecomms lines, long before now.  Half the media circus which this affair has now become has done so purely on the basis of media continuing to be able to broadcast.  That would be a lot harder if Kiev was a dark city.  And the furor and 'they're winning!' rah-rah of selective press interviews would be a lot less.  
Third, the assumption that the Russians have to enter Kiev to conquer it is likely an unwise one.  
With \~10m accuracy and careful (TOD) timing, Russian artillery can likely destroy water/power/gas/emergency services/telecomms/food distribution at relatively low civilian collateral risk.  And thereby rapidly flip the 'Every Citizen A Soldier!' Starship Trooper concept on it's ear as all those mouths are connected to one herd mind, which will begin to panic, as civilians always do, when cut off from government reassurance and steady supplies of food.  
Add to this transport nodes (train stations), cross roads (checkpoints), major supply and maneuver avenues and a general lockdown of Kiev results, isolating the Ukrainians in their own heads.  
It's unlikely that all of Kiev can or will be defended.

[],False,,Likmylovepump,,,[],,,,text,t2_ain9i,False,False,"John Mearsheimer's stance on most issues seems, quite frankly, entirely informed by hindsight. His doveish attitude towards Russia is entirely contradicted by a hawkish stance on China, with little discernible reason for the difference in opinion aside from the fact that we took opposite approaches with each country and each of those approaches have caused the west some issues.  
  
For example, with China he says the west's doveish approach was foolish because it was exploited and enabled their rise to power. Fine, but it was never a given that that was the inevitable outcome -- this stance was, and could, only adopted in hindsight. Instead, he thinks the west should have smothered China's economy the moment the cold war was over (surely a recipe for stability in the east is an economically desperate nuclear armed China with nothing to lose right?).  
  
Conversely, with Russia, he thinks it was foolish to expand NATO eastwards because they were weak and in decline, as though doing otherwise would have resulted in some sort of rapprochement with Russia. But again, this is hardly guarenteed. I don't really see much indication that a gentler approach to Russia would have seen them any less belligerent. We might very well instead have been fretting about incursions into the Baltic states in addition to Ukraine, and beyond, in this hypothetical universe where NATO stays put.  
  
And again, using his logic with China, NATO expansion eastwards while Russia, the greatest adversary the US had faced in it's history to that point, was too weak to doing anything about it makes perfect sense -- yet he takes the opposite stance. He tries to paper over this inconsistency by saying he's ""only interested in what works"" but, again, you only know what works after you've tried something, and I find him incredibly lacking in any real analysis that would help guide future actions.  
  
I think Mearsheimer is motivated more by a bone he has to pick with the foreign policy ""liberal blob"" (seriously his talks are dripping in resentment about how ""dinosaurs like him"" are treated) than any real principled approach towards geopolitics.  
  
There's an alternate universe out there Mearsheimer is railing against the stupidity of the west for going easy on Russia and too hard on China post-Cold War as Russian troops march into the non NATO aligned eastern Europe and Chinese troops pile up in North Korea to push the the west to reduce trade sanctions.",a59fd16fea096d78dc12ed44f78b455a25405445,True,False,,,,,0,1646037744,,0,{},hyr93a4,False,t3_t2odoq,False,True,t1_hyr6ie5,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t2odoq/ukraine_megathread_february_27/hyr93a4/,1646037755,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646008944.0,

[Russia](https://web.archive.org/web/20220226051154/http://ria.ru/location_rossiyskaya-federatsiya/) is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe in our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome. Yes, at a great cost, yes, through the tragic events of a virtual civil war, because now brothers, separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies, are still shooting at each other, but there will be no more [Ukraine](https://web.archive.org/web/20220226051154/http://ria.ru/location_Ukraine/) as anti-Russia. Russia is restoring its historical fullness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we had abandoned this, if we had allowed the temporary division to take hold for centuries, then we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.

Did someone in the old European capitals, in [Paris](https://web.archive.org/web/20220226051154/http://ria.ru/location_Paris/) and [Berlin](https://web.archive.org/web/20220226051154/http://ria.ru/location_Berlin/) , seriously believe that [Moscow](https://web.archive.org/web/20220226051154/http://ria.ru/location_Moskva/) would give up [Kiev](https://web.archive.org/web/20220226051154/http://ria.ru/location_Kiev/) ? That the Russians will forever be a divided people? And at the same time when Europe is uniting, when the German and French elites are trying to seize control of European integration from the Anglo-Saxons and assemble a united Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe became possible only thanks to the unification of [Germany](https://web.archive.org/web/20220226051154/http://ria.ru/location_Germany/), which happened according to the good Russian (albeit not very smart) will. To swipe after that also on Russian lands is not even the height of ingratitude, but of geopolitical stupidity. The West as a whole, and even more so Europe in particular, did not have the strength to keep Ukraine in its sphere of influence, and even more so to take Ukraine for itself. In order not to understand this, one had to be just geopolitical fools.
...
Because the construction of a new world order - and this is the third dimension of current events - is accelerating, and its contours are more and more clearly visible through the spreading cover of Anglo-Saxon globalization. A multipolar world has finally become a reality - the operation in Ukraine is not capable of rallying anyone but the West against Russia. Because the rest of the world sees and understands perfectly well - this is a conflict between Russia and the West, this is a response to the geopolitical expansion of the Atlanticists, this is Russia's return of its historical space and its place in the world.
...
China and India , Latin America and Africa , the Islamic world and Southeast Asia - no one believes that the West leads the world order, much less sets the rules of the game. Russia has not only challenged the West, it has shown that the era of Western global domination can be considered completely and finally over. The new world will be built by all civilizations and centers of power, naturally, together with the West (united or not) - but not on its terms and not according to its rules.",fabe10376378a52b562e1e0af5a2623ccdbaf6e2,True,False,,,,,0,1646036172,,0,{},hyr71yc,False,t3_t2nbtx,False,True,t1_hyqx7rs,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t2nbtx/lets_say_ukraine_wins_a_decisive_victory_whats/hyr71yc/,1646036186,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646007372.0,

It's also charged with performing covert actions - those would be sabotage or assassination, potentially, but much more frequently those covert actions are along the lines of interfacing with, say, Kurdish forces opposing ISIL.

A frequent mission for the CIA's paramilitary division - the pointy end of the stick, in terms of covert actions -  is financing, supporting, training, and equipping local forces that have goals or ideologies aligned with U.S. policy, or that can be co-opted to serve said policies. As such, once approved by the President, the CIA can funnel essentially any military equipment it thinks will be useful to groups it is supporting. Relative to the scale of pretty much any resistance force, the CIA's funds are essentially limitless.

The Stingers sent to Afghanistan were a particularly good return on investment, because Stingers forced the Soviets to alter how they used their helicopters in day-to-day operations (very painful in a place like Afghanistan, where land mobility is deeply limited by geography, and even more so by frequent IEDs and ambushes), and a fair number of helos were shot down with Stingers as well, which increased the strain on Soviet resources, morale, and public opinion as the conflict wore on.

Even when equipment isn't directly sourced by the CIA, there's a good chance they will be involved in some way with ensuring that military aid makes it from friendly borders into Ukrainian hands - a consequence of their focus on human intelligence and covert actions, is the capability to create covert supply and infiltration routes for friendly groups, and oversee the flow of cash, goods, and potentially reinforcements to and from a conflict zone.",5fbf8ce49cd62186aa77578427b61ed99774feb5,True,False,,,,,0,1646034875,,0,{},hyr5bax,False,t3_t2nqt7,False,True,t1_hyq8e4l,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t2nqt7/germanys_1000_antitank_weapons_and_500_stinger/hyr5bax/,1646034889,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646006075.0,

I think Trump (and Putin) fully expected him to win a second term but that was foiled by the big uptick in mail-in ballots allowed by states because of the pandemic.

[],False,,MisterBanzai,,,[],,,,text,t2_161z7d,False,False,"&gt; I think at this point it is still really hard to tell how well Ukraine is actually doing. All we can say for sure is that they haven't rolled over. For comparison sake, the US didn't move into Baghdad until 3 weeks after the Iraq war kicked off.

I made this [same argument just the other day](https://www.reddit.com/r/LessCredibleDefence/comments/t1n7vl/polish_convoy_with_a_resupply_of_ammunition/hyhnxbd/?context=3), but OSINT on Russia's intentions, likely timeline, and their losses is beginning to paint a more clear picture. That picture isn't looking good for Ukraine, but strategically, it might be looking even worse for Russia.

The first question is ""What were Russia's objectives?"" There were a number of likely COAs that went everywhere from very conservative (connect Crimea and Donetsk via the Sea of Azov coastline) to very extreme (seize the entire country). It appears as though Russia's primary goals were to take Kyiv and everything east of the Dnieper, with some maritime reserve forces retained for possible operations against Odessa. [There are hints](https://www.reddit.com/r/LessCredibleDefence/comments/t2wyyt/sputnik_accidentally_posted_an_essay_intended_for/) that Russia believed achieving this would have been sufficient to affect regime change and/or to annex Ukraine.

The next question is ""What was their timeline?"" It's always hard to be sure what is propaganda and what is fact, especially with Ukraine waging such an effective IO campaign, but it does seem as though Russia is truly having serious logistical problems. Russian forces aren't merely outrunning their supply lines and having to pause; they're abandoning large quantities of materiel. Russian forces also made a point of bypassing urban areas in the east in order to drive on Kyiv. Taken together, it seems as though Russia really did anticipate that this would be a short campaign with forces largely intending to rely on organic sustainment capabilities (e.g. just carrying a 3 day-of-supply).

The third question is ""How severe are their casualties?"" Ukrainian OPSEC has been tight-lipped enough that we can't get a good read on their remaining strength, but it does appear that they still have some uncommitted reserves. I'm not so credulous as to accept [Ukraine's claims on Russian losses](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1497874453178552325), but there is plenty of reason to believe that Russian losses have been significant. At this point, we've seen enough [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQFxnmY8hss) of [severe](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/news/video-2624511/Video-Large-Russian-military-convoy-sits-destroyed-Kharkiv.html) [Russian](https://9gag.com/gag/a817oxQ) [losses](https://metro.co.uk/video/carnage-russian-convoy-destroyed-near-kherson-2624341/) that we can be confident that they are taking fairly high casualties. Some of these destroyed convoys, like the one near Kyiv, represent the loss of an entire mechanized company in terms of combat power. Given that these videos are only a small fraction of what is probably taking place, it seems that Russian losses are conservatively upwards of a 1000 personnel. Some of these losses also appear to be critical capabilities too (for instance, the last video I linked shows what appears to be a destroyed assault bridging company), and it's reasonable to believe that Russian forces are operating at significantly degraded capability.

Putting it all together, it seems likely that although Russia is still winning this fight right now, they have failed to meet their strategic goals, their operational timeline, and they are likely taking losses at an unsustainable level. Depending on the depth of remaining reserves for this operation, it is possible (even likely) that we are seeing some of the last offensives of this campaign. I actually believe that Russia no longer possesses the capability to effectively encircle and siege Kyiv, and I would not be surprised to see Putin negotiating for a ceasefire after capturing the Sea of Azov coastline. That's the minimum amount of territory he could take and hope to spin as a victory to a domestic audience.",bd4879aa375f749e5c11c8ae85f5d8b94ce3615c,True,False,,,,,0,1646029935,,0,{},hyqy93h,False,t3_t2zf5q,False,True,t1_hyqay95,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t2zf5q/how_much_of_ukraines_current_success_do_you_think/hyqy93h/,1646029947,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646001135.0,

But the NAPLAN-90 document was from 1980, and (as I mentioned in another comment) if you look at [the Kansas map in the NAPLAN-90 link,](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0dbfdd0c601b62e7d65901fef765d923) you'll see the strike locations largely match up [with a map of Kansas military bases and nuclear silos.](https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/DocumentCenter/View/5840/Federal-Facilities-Program-Overview-PDF?bidId=)

A strike without warning or buildup would easily take out the airborne segment of the nuclear triad, as it takes longer for nuclear bombers to load and launch than the 30 minutes an ICBM takes from launch to impact.  And any delay or malfunction on the part of the enemy's leadership or equipment could lead to ICBMs failing to launch in time too.

The reason military targets are prioritized is because the humanity doesn't cease to exist when a nuclear war starts.

The above images circulated the internet four hours ago, depicting columns of Russian vehicles moving SW along highway P-02, intended to reinforce Russian positions around Kyiv. Based on the order of march and Russian doctrine, I would say we're seeing a Mechanized Battalion Tactical Group (BTG) from the 36th Combined Arms Army (CAA). BTGs are commonly composed of a Motor Rifle Battalion, Tank Company, Artillery Battalion, Intelligence Company, UAV Crew, Air Defense Platoon, Material Support Platoon, Reconnaissance Platoon, and an Electronic Warfare Platoon. In short, this formation brings the firepower of \~30 IFVs, 10 Tanks, and over 300 combat arms personnel with associated Air Defense and Artillery support. Definitely a point of concern that Russia is mobilizing second echelon reserves, but the picture has been highly sensationalized because of the size of the convoy.  
  
The BTG is the formation of choice that Russia deploys into combat with. The forces entering Ukraine have been similarly organized, but we didn't see them massed in the same way because they were splitting into parallel avenues of approach to avoid traffic congestion (They were planning on civilian traffic being present), as they raced to the capital. This method of advancing on parallel axes and subsequent actions on contact is reminiscent of Soviet Deep Battle Doctrine. Essentially, the BTG was splitting into Company Tactical Groups (Scaled down version of the BTG) while maneuvering on parallel roads. When one CTG took contact, it would remain to fix or destroy the opposing forces, while the BTG continued mission down its axis of advance.   
  
Russian logistics, poorly coordinated, were not following in trace behind the combat elements as they advanced on Kyiv. Tanks, being the resource intensive machines they are, would go black on fuel and request resupply. However, resupply would not come because Ukrainian forces would be able to mass and concentrate combat power on isolated CTGs, defeating them. This left the tanks without gas, and closed off any safe routes logistics vehicles could take to provide support. Any that attempted to push through were ambushed and destroyed.  
  
So that brings us back to today's massive convoy. Seeking to avoid more stranded vehicles, BTG commanders are probably consolidating their forces on one primary route, to allow for more command and control in relation to sustainment operations. What does this imply for our Ukrainian servicemen? A couple of things:  
  
	A. The Russians are adapting to early operational mistakes. The consolidation of supply will allow for organic sustainment within the BTG for operations extending past where we witnessed Russian tanks running out of gas. However, this does not fix the overall logistical problem that Russia still has to sort out. The fuel and munitions on those logistics vehicles are going to run out, and they still have to figure out how to conduct further resupply on roads that they probably are still not securing. Additionally, the consolidation of supplies in this manner is ok when contact is not expected, but due to a failure to secure air superiority, and the ambiguity of where combatants are due to poor situational awareness, the supply trains are still a high payoff target for massed fires. This is only exacerbated by the poor spacing between vehicles that we see in the photo.  
	  
	B. UA forces engaging incoming Russian forces will have to face the massed combat power of a BTG, rather than the much more manageable chunks. Especially of concern is the BTG's indirect fire support due to the presence of a forward observer. In the previous method of parallel axes, the forward observer would attach to the bypassing units, allowing Ukrainian forces to engage the leftover CTGs without as much concern of avoiding Russian fires.  
	  
	C. Key to defeating the BTGs arrayed in this formation is the elimination of their SAM capabilities. This would allow for the UA forces to bring their Bayraktar systems to bear. The Russians probably aren't varying their order of march from doctrine, or from when they step off, so their location should be easy enough to find and send to St. Javelin.  
  
TLDR: Big scary column just means more bodies being thrown into the fight, in an ineffective way. Still brings challenges, but are definitely challenges the Ukrainian servicemen can overcome. Slava Ukraini!

Well one of the nice things about using a nuclear weapon is that you don't have to be incredibly accurate.

---

&gt; Military targets were secondary considerations in the decision to use nuclear weapons in Hiroshima. I believe a first strike nuclear bombing in the future would also occur in a similar situation to the example we have and be guided by similar considerations.

They're completely different situations, which is why modern nuclear weapons have completely different targets.  Yes, Nagasaki and Hiroshima were destroyed with nuclear weapons primarily for psychological effect.  Though that was not just to scare the population, but to hammer in the inevitability of Japan's defeat, so that the leadership would surrender with less bloodshed.

To put it in perspective, roughly 200,000 people died as a result the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined (including those due to radiation poisoning).  [(source)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki#:~:text=Over%20the%20next,sizable%20military%20garrison.)

But roughly 100,000 people died in *a single night* of carpet bombing Tokyo, one month earlier. [(source)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Tokyo#:~:text=The%20Operation%20Meetinghouse%20firebombing%20of%20Tokyo%20on%20the%20night%20of%209%20March%201945%20was%20the%20single%20deadliest%20air%20raid%20of%20World%20War%20II%2C%5B22%5D%20greater%20than%20Dresden%2C%5B23%5D%20Hamburg%2C%20Hiroshima%2C%20or%20Nagasaki%20as%20single%20events.)

The fire bombing with 100,000 deaths didn't phase Japan's leadership, but annihilating two cities with two bombs made it clear that there was no point in fighting any more.

---

The big difference now is that, in a nuclear exchange between the US and Russia, each side has massive nuclear capabilities which you want to target and eliminate before the enemy is able to use them.  And they both have functioning armies with which to conduct war.  Destroying both was the highest priority in nuclear targeting for obvious reasons.  And it is an objective fact that these were what the US targeted in the USSR, and what the US expected the USSR to target.

---

&gt; In the hypothetical situation of Russia using a nuclear weapon on Kiev, this doesn't apply as Ukraine has no nuclear weapons to target.

Russia wants a puppet state that it can control.  If it nuked Ukraine, this would be impossible.  Obviously Ukrainians would never accept Russian rule, but also many Russians have family members in Ukraine who wouldn't be happy about having them turned to ash.  And that's not even considering the international response, which would likely end Russia's existence as a country (whether through nuclear retaliation or embargos).  There's really no situation where using nuclear weapons against Ukraine benefits Russia.",853e7360d2355a11364edd2457af8bbe72e9311c,True,False,,,,,0,1646021843,,0,{},hyqk8xx,False,t3_t2meoj,False,True,t1_hyppldk,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t2meoj/how_would_a_nuclear_war_actually_go_down/hyqk8xx/,1646021857,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1645993043.0,

&gt;And if you knew anything about military strategy, then you would know that the blitz that was deployed was intended to take less than one.

And if you knew anything about military strategy, you would know that this was not a blitz. The Russian Army at no point unleashed their strength. They have been extremely cautious in regards to the firepower they use to not cause any collateral damage. The last time we saw a Blitz get deployed that was in the first Gulf War. The Americans deployed everything in their arsenal to knock out the Iraqis. Do you see something similar here? If the Russians really bring their real strength to bear, Ukraine would be a waste land and i am talking about their conventional strength.   


&gt;The fact that it's taken 4 days is a problem for the Russians, because they have gone straight for Kiev (ie blitz) and not stopped along the way to establish lines of logistics.

Look at the maps closely. The Russians largely bypassed the Urban Centers and own the country side, thus they don't need to establish lines of logistics. Isolation and Reduction. The Ukrainians are isolated, just not reduced yet. What happens when the supplies start running low? Kiev is surrounded and starvation will set in soon. Can't really fight with an empty stomach.   


https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2022/2/27/22953776/kyiv-mayor-klitschko-reveals-ukraine-is-approaching-a-humanitarian-crisis  


&gt;Now, they're literally abandoning tanks and armoured vehicles all over the place because they can't get fuel and parts for repairs when they break down. It's basically the Battle of the Bulge Part Two, 

Let me guess. You saw that on Reddit and maybe Twitter that is breaming with Pro Ukrainian propaganda. If what you say was true, the Russians wouldn't be laying siege to Kharkov, Mariupol and wouldn't have Kiev surrounded. Kiev is the prize, the center of all economic/political activity.   


&gt;Wars are won and lost on logistics alone, and here we have an example of precisely why.

Thank You, finally something we agree on. Kiev is running out of food and Russians are not running out of food, fuel and bullets. In fact, they haven't even fired their bullets yet. A video on Reddit of a Russian tank running out of fuel is not equal to the entire Russian Army running out of fuel.   


&gt;If Putin was smart, he would have withdrawn his forces to the border the moment he knew his blitz was being resisted and delayed. And he is smart, but he's also proud, and he's done too much chest thumping to let the world see him bleed, so he won't withdraw.

If Putin withdraws, he's as good as dead. If he is lucky, he gets the firing squad.   


&gt;This is precisely why the Ukraine can win. Because you can have a million tanks and planes, but without fuel, you lose by default.

Sorry mate we must be seeing different wars here. Posting a video or two of fuel tankers getting targeted does not mean Russian Armored Columns are running out of fuel. If they were, the UA would be attacking but they are defending for their life out there even with Russia tying its one hand behind its back.   


Lets hope things go back to peace. Zelensky has realized, time is running out. He has agreed to meet in Belarus instead of Poland where he originally asked. Lets hope Putin can call it a victory and go home. Its unimaginable to think the Russians could have taken the country in 4 days.

And if you knew anything about military strategy, then you would know that the blitz that was deployed was intended to take less than one. The fact that it's taken 4 days is a problem for the Russians, because they have gone straight for Kiev (ie blitz) and not stopped along the way to establish lines of logistics. Now, they're literally abandoning tanks and armoured vehicles all over the place because they can't get fuel and parts for repairs when they break down. It's basically the Battle of the Bulge Part Two, minus the complete and total routing of the invader.

You are also making a false equivalence. The US wasn't 'blitzing' Iraq, they were routing a fortified defender that was ready for them, and they were stopping along the way to set up lines of logistics. Wars are won and lost on logistics alone, and here we have an example of precisely why. If Putin was smart, he would have withdrawn his forces to the border the moment he knew his blitz was being resisted and delayed. And he is smart, but he's also proud, and he's done too much chest thumping to let the world see him bleed, so he won't withdraw. Instead, he'll send reinforcements, but apparently none of them include logistics. This is precisely why the Ukraine can win. Because you can have a million tanks and planes, but without fuel, you lose by default.",14863c1991fcaa45b787b0dfeae6dfc88aae08e5,True,False,,,,,0,1646016088,,0,{},hyq85ns,False,t3_t2nbtx,False,True,t1_hypxn0x,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t2nbtx/lets_say_ukraine_wins_a_decisive_victory_whats/hyq85ns/,1646016100,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1645987288.0,

The Pzf3 variant the Netherlands uses has an advanced magnified scope and rangefinder with a build-in guidance computer (night sight can be added), through which you can hit moving targets at 600 meters and stationary targets at 900 meters with both a very high hit probability. And with &gt;900mm penetration behind ERA (to me knowledge NLAW and Javelin are far lower than that, but Pzf needs the high penetration as it can't do guided top attack) it is able to take out the heaviest tanks. The minimum range is 15 meters, can be used indoors, and is very easy to use (point and shoot), so very good for urban areas, even when the distances are quite long. Relatively light as well (same weight as NLAW).

So a very powerful, quick, cheap, simple to use, and accurate at short to medium ranges unguided RPG that can be used indoors and in confined spaces. You could even give these Pzf 3 to relatively untrained people and very shortly expose yourself, quickly shoot off a single round, and disappear again.

Oh man, we're seeing a lot of planning failures here at the PLT and SQD level.  
  
Situation: We see a unit of Russians conducting what is most likely a movement to contact in an urban area. Dispersion of 15-25m between vehicles, and 2-5m between personnel in a Squad, Soldiers moving in columns. They take fire from what sounds like a DShK (.50 cal US equivalent). Russian Soldiers in contact disperse and find what cover they can along a linear danger area (LDA). 3 vehicles positively ID'd in the video indicate a Russian Platoon, and the vehicles they are using (Tigrs) cue us in to contract rather than conscript Soldiers. In the last couple of seconds of the video we see crew served weapons on top of the vehicles engaging contacts to the 9 o'clock of the formation, while a Russian Soldier fires either a GP-25 (40mm grenade launcher) or RPG-7 (HE munition) at a building to the 6 o'clock.  
  
Observations  
  
Movement Technique. When enemy contact is likely, units should use a bounding overwatch technique where one maneuver element establishes a base of fire overwatching the movement of the unit bounding past them. Once the moving unit reaches its intended area, it establishes a base of fire and indicates for the unit to the rear to bound up to establish its base of fire. These units then do this ""leap frogging"" repeatedly until they reach their limit of advance. Here we see the Russian forces utilizing the traveling technique, usually reserved for when contact isn't likely, to move into an urban area with expected enemy forces. A terrible mistake, as each building is likely enemy contact.  
  
Reaction. The vehicles firing to the 9 o'clock, while the Soldier engages to the 12 may be indicative that these Soldiers may not be trained in even the most basic of contact drills: providing the distance, direction, and description of enemy forces. Considering the most likely layout of an ambush, the Soldier firing to the 12 o'clock probably isn't engaging a target of any meaning.  
  
Dispersion. The spacing of vehicles may be excused as them wanting to provide cover for each other, but the spacing of the dismounts is not. The lethal radius of a grenade is about 5m, and the injury radius is 15. If Ukrainian forces engaged with an AGS-40 (Automatic Grenade Launcher), or a claymore, this Platoon's combat power would be destroyed and would require reconstitution.  
  
As we can see below, the results of poor tactics. From alleged Spetsnaz of all units! You can come to your own conclusions about Russian capabilities, but I have come to mine.

The Ukranian military didn't really fight, not at first, anyway, and certainly not in Crimea. I recall there was a garrison of Ukrainian Marines who were besieged near Sevastopol before they were eventually allowed to leave with their weapons. It was all very polite.

In Donetsk and Luhansk there was fighting, eventually, and it ramped up in intensity. But fundamentally the conflict was a territorial dispute, with the smokescreen of ""spontaneous"" breakaway regions. Even when Russia moved in troops, it was in small numbers and done in a way to maintain some degree of deniability.

This is entirely different -- a full-scale invasion with the goal of conquering the entire nation of Ukraine, a democratic nation aligned with the EU. Even if Russia ""only"" wanted to violently overthrow Ukraine's government and install a compliant puppet, that is still a de facto conquest that would in practice make Ukraine just another state within the Russian Empire.

This is something that hasn't been seen in Europe since WWII. Even the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 isn't really comparable, since Hungary was already part of the USSR.

But even then, we wouldn't have seen the same level of response if Ukraine hadn't put up such a determined fight. If VDV and Spetznaz forces had managed to get into central Kiev and seize the Ukrainian government and state institutions before a defense could be mustered, if Russian forces had advanced from the borders and captured cities with minimal bloodshed, if Putin could announce fait accompli before Europe and NATO could respond, I don't think we'd be seeing anywhere near the same level of response. Russia would still be sanctioned, but probably no where near so brutally. NATO would still step up its readiness, forces would still be deployed to the Baltic states, and Germany might even still make noises about stepping up military spending.

But, after a couple of days it became increasing clear after a couple of days that they weren't losing. The Ukranian military has put up stiff resistance, they've declared a degree of general mobilization verging on levee en masse, and hundreds of thousands or even millions of Ukranian citizens are arming themselves and preparing molotov cocktails. And meanwhile, Russia isn't even close to mounting a major assault on, let alone capturing, any of the major cities in Ukraine such as Kiev or Kharkiv, even when Kharkiv is just a short hop from the border and Russian forces could advance down from Belarus to the outskirts of Kiev without any major obstacles. And not only that, but even more minor urban centers, such as Chernihiv and Sumy, which are important strategic targets and very close to the starting points of the Russian forces, are holding out.

So, Ukraine is getting this level of support not only because Putin's actions have been a grotesque shock to the post-WWII world order, but because it became clear that with western military aid they can win, in the sense of preventing Putin from achieving his strategic goals. And the entire Western World has a strongly vested interest in maintaining that post-WWII order and re-sending the message that it is no longer permissible for nations to conquer one another, and especially not in Europe.",021233fcf2d769f4f9b44127d8358823788c2792,True,False,,,,,0,1646009032,,0,{},hypsxdm,False,t3_t2odoq,False,True,t1_hypha3b,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t2odoq/ukraine_megathread_february_27/hypsxdm/,1646009044,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1645980232.0,

You're asking as if the alternative is between them shelling Kiev and not shelling Kiev. Russia has consistently broken every treaty and promise they have made with Ukraine.

I believe that in the case where an escalation to the use of Hiroshima style strategic nuclear weapons is in play that similar considerations will guide the decisions.

The bombs dropped at Hiroshima and Nagasaki were small compared to the current capabilities of nuclear weapons - and I find it difficult to believe that a weapon containing more explosive powe than all the bombs dropped in WW2 can be specifically targeted at a missile silo.

There are two different situations at play here one is to justify a nuclear weapons program in peacetime. Of course during peace time and outside of a specific threat, nuclear weapons would be justified as a way of disabling military infrastructure. 

The other situation is during a the heat of an actual conventional war (for example Japan vs US). In the Japanese case, conventional bombing was effectively taking out military and war supporting infrastructure.

&gt; The committee settled on two ""psychological"" objectives of the first atomic bombing: to scare the Japanese into unconditional surrender and to impress upon the world the power of the new weapon.
