&gt;China is Taiwan’s largest trading partner, accounting for 26.3 percent of total trade and 22.2 percent of Taiwan’s imports in 2020. In terms of total trade, other major Taiwan trading partners include Japan (10.9 percent), the European Union (8.2 percent), and Hong Kong (7.9 percent).

Would it be a good idea for the US to invade Venezuela right now?

Also, by increasing the supply of oil and gas, the price will go down, which will cause the petroleum-dependent economy of Russia to go even further into the toilet. Venezuela could also be used as a bargaining chip against Russia that could be used to get concessions in a peace deal.

Venezuela's conventional military is fairly weak, so the initial invasion should be fairly easy. 88% of the population is urban, so there probably won't be much of a jungle insurgency. An urban insurgency might occur, though. Concentration camps or massive troop surges (conscription?) could be employed to put them down.

2. Russian and Chinese interests overlap.

3. Per 1, once Russia's interests have sufficiently come down to face reality, they will no longer be in significant conflict with those of the US.

But, I do think that it is completely the wrong question to ask, if like the rest of us you're trying to make sense of this situation. Ukraine exists for geopolitical purposes. Every government it has had since its creation in the '90s has either orientated towards the US or Russia. Its key policies have always been dictated by a stronger power. 

I honestly believe Russia did not have the means to contest the enlargement of NATO at the same level we see now. They accepted the first and second major enlargements but at each time their opposition grew steadily louder. Bucharest in 2008, was where I think the Russians made it very clear that they would not accept it anymore. Crucially, Russia is now in a position to challenge the status quo and believes it has prepared enough to withstand what the West will throw at it, short of actual military engagement. We'll find out the strength of their resolve and preparations in due time.

And, this isn't a fringe opinion. Multiple theorists, writers and scholars in the West have raised the potential dangers of enlarging both the EU and NATO. I do think the West knew that it was pushing Russia into a standoff but given the frantic and slightly chaotic European response to this situation, I don't think they expected the ferocity of Russia's response. 

I'm surprised you've asked the question regarding China because it seems clear that that is exactly what China is in the process of doing with Hong Kong and is gearing up to do with Taiwan.  I don't think it's a stretch to state that what happens in Ukraine will undoubtedly affect the position of all these other smaller states around the world. 

Finland was a buffer state. Buffer states I believe can only really exist in multipolar situations. The Russians made many mistakes in the 90s and geopolitically one of them was not quite grasping that they lived in a unipolar world.

yes and people in major population centers would not be happy with tiny counties deciding their policies with less than the majority vote.

So you are correct that the college system is effective at shifting the balance of power towards rural areas. The fact that you see that as a bonus is simply a matter of opinion

The alternative is to shift the balance toward population centers. Popular vote would also be ""effective"" for this.

saying that one is better than the other because its ""effective"" is foolish because to say something is effective, you have to answer ""effective for what cause?"". And then you have to ask your self whether you think thats good or bad.

I feel like you kind of missed the point, in the previous comment you said something like ""but people in one country dont want people in another country deciding what they do""

my point is that the electoral college doesn't solve this. small countries would absolutely be concerned about population only method because it would allow their concerns to be ignored.

Why would he?  Trump was trying to end sanctions, weaken NATO, and hold back funding and weapons from Ukraine.  Why would Putin make waves and jeopardize these concessions by alerting the US public?

&gt; the Taliban were not sitting in the presidents chair in Kabul

Trump pulled all meaningful defensive troops out and released all of the Taliban fighters right before this.  Putin had military intel on this and knew there was nothing Biden could have done anyway.  

&gt; Also remember when Obama was president and Biden the Vice President, the russians took Crimea from Ukraine, and the impotent duo also didnt do very much.

What do you mean they do much?  What did you want them to do?  Obama signed executive orders to sanction Russia.  Congress didn't act until 2017 and then they only acted because Trump (and the Flynn russian-sanction scandal) made it clear that Trump wanted to life sanctions on Russia.

i mean thats just a fundamental disagreement that I have with democracy. I dont think child abuse is okay just because the adults who live in that area think its okay or dont want to do anything about it. Personally I dont really care who is making the decision or what the majority thinks, If its illegal to discriminate against black people it should be illegal to discriminate against gay people. In our civil rights laws it is illegal to discriminate against someone for being from another country, but it is not illegal to discriminate against someone for being from another state of the union. that makes no sense. I understand what you are saying about majority rules, but when a government produces results like that I dont think the results are good because of the method, it makes me think the method is flawed.

Heres another issue with this thinking. Have you heard of the electoral college? In the united states we have been arguing about confederalism vs. federalism since our inception, and it was a major factor in the civil war. In addition, the DTrump populist movement had a lot to do with rural resentment.

Here are the two views: if we didnt have the electoral college, then policy would be driven and decided by major population centers. To some this seems like a non issue because popular vote = majority rule. The counter is to point out that different geographies and economies require different policies. So thats how we ended up with the electoral college system. Under this system the state wyoming has only 50000 people in it, but they get 3 electoral college votes and two senators. So they have more representation from a per capita standpoint. Personally that seems like a violation of equal protection under the law to me.

so it seems like you view, the US system of government to allow each state to make decisions with non-interference from other states, when in reality that is not quite true. in fact, both ways of organizing votes (popular and electoral) give undue power to either rural OR urban settings. 

what country r u in jc?

&gt;I mean vice versa, isn’t it good to have states able to “lead the way” in legislation? Things like LGBTQ rights and legalization of marijuana were done by states earlier than federal, and were pivotal to get federal action.

ya thats true but the fact that people support states rights when it gets things they want passed and support federal power when it gets things they want done, is a mark of instability not a benefit. I live in alabama so it usually goes the other way for me. Here's an example: alabama made it illegal to fly drones over industrial areas, because people were reporting companies to the EPA for violating federal law. Do you see the issue with that?

The stakes for the world are genuinely higher in Ukraine than (for example) Mali. Putin's Russia has been active in harming distant countries for a decade or two, from chemical attacks, to malicious intelligence operations, to nuclear proliferation. And will presumably continue to be. 

Whether Assad is in power (for example) matters to the people of one country, and their neighbours to some degree, plus has some middling geopolitical ramifications for a few other interested parties. Whether Putin is finally backed into a corner and what he does at that moment is world history in the making.

[],False,,Bartsches,,,[],,,,text,t2_6je10,False,False,"&gt;Doing away with nuclear energy out of emotional rather than logical thinking [...]

I would contest this assumption. Nuclear energy is, to my mind, a question of three independent considerations.

First of economic. All power sources (as do many things) have societal costs above what's reflected in their market price. Nuclears largest two are long term storage and risk. And while I'm not privy to what the long term storage would cost per kWh, German insurers did calculate the cost associated to risk. They come down to about 4€ per kWh. This is on top the regular price. Do note that the insurable mass is so high that an insurance was a non-starter from the very beginning, inflation from self interest is therefore very unlikely in this case. So nuclear energy loses to all other common forms of energy production in terms of pure costs. 

Second is Safety. Whereas a country like the US can put reactors simply somewhere and if they go off most of the country is fine and can carry on as usual, an accident in Germany would risk effectively ending the country or at least paralyse it in any meaningful metric. To give you an idea of scale, Germans to this day can't eat wild mushrooms in parts of the country sometimes due to leftover radiation from Chernobyl - and it's located on the other side of a country Germany doesn't even have a border with. So while a major accident is unlikely, if it does happen there might be no recovery from it. When looking from the lense of a state on state conflict, a saboteur in a nuclear plant would be a conceivable way to knock Germany out of any escalating conflict early, thus creating a major strategic vulnerability.

The only real advantage is, as you said with the fuel dependency. Though I'm not sure if this weakness is actionable from the Russian side in any truly major way. Russia is as dependent on this relationship and I'd be willing to bet a considerable sum that Germany is able to switch suppliers faster than Russia is able to find an equivalent buyer.

A major point here is that Germany did expect Russia to be more, ahem, constrained, but hindsight is not a factor in historical decisions.

Nato is secondary

&gt;If Russia’s main concern had been NATO enlargement, it would have reacted with rhetoric and/or hostile actions in its neighborhood after each step in the NATO expansion process. The largest wave of NATO’s eastward expansion took place in March 2004, when seven Eastern European countries joined, including the formerly Soviet Baltic states. Russia “grumbled,” as the New York Times put it then, by adopting a Duma resolution criticizing the expansion, but no hostile and sustained rhetoric followed about NATO enlargement as a Western plot against Russian interests.

In 1997, Ukraine’s President Leonid Kuchma signed the Charter on a Distinctive Partnership between NATO and Ukraine, and in 2002, he publicly declared Ukraine’s interest in NATO membership, to little opposition from Russia. The NATO membership issue has ebbed-and-flowed within Ukraine, as presidents alternated in power who were either more pro-Western or more pro-Russian. Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko advocated during his 2005-2010 tenure for Ukraine to be granted a NATO membership action plan (MAP), a program of preparation for entry into the alliance, while successor President Viktor Yanukovych backed away from the idea after 2010. Russia did not respond to any of these pro-NATO moves by Ukrainian presidents with military threats and aggression.

The article continues with this

&gt;A longer look at Putin’s two decades in power shows that, above all, he fears political competition in the neighborhood. When mass protests over rigged elections swept across the post-Soviet space in 2003-2005, toppling the Georgian and Kyrgyz incumbents and preventing the pro-Russian candidate from taking office in Ukraine, the Kremlin exploded with fiery rhetoric about Western-backed anti-Russian plots. A recent book on conspiracy theories in the Russian media since 1995 shows that the 2003-2005 “color revolutions” were the top source of conspiratorial, anti-Western narratives. All 1997-2002 NATO enlargement summits are lower in the ranking of analyzed events. American realists have long argued that Russia was too weak to strike back with actions, but evidence shows that the Kremlin did not react with strong rhetoric either. Instead of decrying NATO expansion, Russia prioritized complaints about Western political “meddling” in its neighboring countries, by which Russia meant U.S. and European support for domestic democratization drives.

According to the article Putin is worried about

&gt;NATO’s eastward expansion may have played a role in straining the relationship between Russia and the West, but mainly because, for Russia, seeing former satellites eagerly abandon it for the greener pastures of Euro-Atlantic integration stung.

Nato is secondary

&gt;If Russia’s main concern had been NATO enlargement, it would have reacted with rhetoric and/or hostile actions in its neighborhood after each step in the NATO expansion process. The largest wave of NATO’s eastward expansion took place in March 2004, when seven Eastern European countries joined, including the formerly Soviet Baltic states. Russia “grumbled,” as the New York Times put it then, by adopting a Duma resolution criticizing the expansion, but no hostile and sustained rhetoric followed about NATO enlargement as a Western plot against Russian interests.

In 1997, Ukraine’s President Leonid Kuchma signed the Charter on a Distinctive Partnership between NATO and Ukraine, and in 2002, he publicly declared Ukraine’s interest in NATO membership, to little opposition from Russia. The NATO membership issue has ebbed-and-flowed within Ukraine, as presidents alternated in power who were either more pro-Western or more pro-Russian. Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko advocated during his 2005-2010 tenure for Ukraine to be granted a NATO membership action plan (MAP), a program of preparation for entry into the alliance, while successor President Viktor Yanukovych backed away from the idea after 2010. Russia did not respond to any of these pro-NATO moves by Ukrainian presidents with military threats and aggression.

The article continues with this

&gt;A longer look at Putin’s two decades in power shows that, above all, he fears political competition in the neighborhood. When mass protests over rigged elections swept across the post-Soviet space in 2003-2005, toppling the Georgian and Kyrgyz incumbents and preventing the pro-Russian candidate from taking office in Ukraine, the Kremlin exploded with fiery rhetoric about Western-backed anti-Russian plots. A recent book on conspiracy theories in the Russian media since 1995 shows that the 2003-2005 “color revolutions” were the top source of conspiratorial, anti-Western narratives. All 1997-2002 NATO enlargement summits are lower in the ranking of analyzed events. American realists have long argued that Russia was too weak to strike back with actions, but evidence shows that the Kremlin did not react with strong rhetoric either. Instead of decrying NATO expansion, Russia prioritized complaints about Western political “meddling” in its neighboring countries, by which Russia meant U.S. and European support for domestic democratization drives.

According to the article Putin is worried about

&gt;NATO’s eastward expansion may have played a role in straining the relationship between Russia and the West, but mainly because, for Russia, seeing former satellites eagerly abandon it for the greener pastures of Euro-Atlantic integration stung.

Michael McFaul (former ambassador to Russia) writes about how Putin's view of geopolitics fundamentally differs from the dominant views in the US.

&gt; In the United States, the dominant analytic framework for explaining international relations today is realism. This theory assumes that all countries are the same: unitary actors seeking to maximize their power or security through rational calculations in an anarchic world. The only thing that matters in the world is power — both the power of individual countries and the balance of power among them.

&gt; Those deploying this model to explain Russia’s behavior today (not Putin’s because individuals don’t matter to realists) also offer several prescriptions for how to defuse the current Russia-Ukraine crisis: Freeze NATO expansion and Russia will be content. Offer face-saving concessions that give Russia tangible gains and the threat of war will subside. Don’t arm Ukraine because that will fuel escalation and trigger a Russian invasion.

&gt; If Putin thought like us, maybe some of these proposals might work. But Putin does not think like us.

Once the main rocket sequence starts it will accelerate to a high speed. At that point it's out of fuel and everything it does from there is a function of trading speed and altitude to maneuver.

This is why most aircraft counter maneuvers when being targeted by a missile is aimed at bleeding off the missiles' energy (since the aircraft has continuous propulsion). If enough energy can be bled off, the missile will no longer be able to close the gap between it and the aircraft before it starts to fall out of the sky.

This is outright wrong. Let me quote [this](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/113/27/7449.full.pdf) study:

aid to refugees creates significant positive income spillovers to host-
country businesses and households. An additional adult refugee re-
ceiving cash aid increases annual real income in the local economy
by $205 to $253, significantly more than the $120–$126 in aid each
refugee receives. Trade between the local economy and the rest of
Rwanda increases by $49 to $55.

Yes and No. 

All vessels of every nation are allowed the right of innocent passage, which means they should be allowed to pass through these areas provided they are following the rules.

This is codified in UNCLOS article 19.

However, you can prohibit vessels from certain areas if you believe them to be doing something illegal, such as breaking the economic sanctions on Russia, transporting weapons or military hardware or military personnel.

Probably not, it's safe to assume Russia stockpiled before the invasion and by all means, they have a substantial oil production

&gt;Does the payments situation make anything harder?

Doubtful as well, Russia mostly handles its arm forces on a purely internal basis (which is also why their expense ratio is deceptive, they pay for almost everything in ruble).

Possibly some spare parts could become harder to come by as time goes on, especially if Russia is barred from receiving micro-chips, as is discussed. I'm not sure it would be fast enough to be felt during the conflict though.

&gt;Could troops become less willing to go to the front, or are too many of them already there?

Maybe if the conflict was to last several weeks/months, but I doubt the arm forces would start to mutiny any time soon.

The Advance of Russia and the New World

A new world is being born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine has opened a new era - and in three dimensions at once. And, of course, in the fourth, internal Russian dimension. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but it is worth talking about this separately a little later.

Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe of our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome. Yes, at great cost, yes, through the tragic events of the actual civil war, because now the brothers, separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies, are still shooting at each other - but there will be no more Ukraine as the anti-Russia. Russia is restoring its historical wholeness by gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its totality of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we refused to do this, if we allowed the temporary division to take hold for centuries, we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but we would be damned by our descendants - for allowing the collapse of the Russian land.

Vladimir Putin took upon himself - without a bit of exaggeration - a historical responsibility, deciding not to leave the resolution of the Ukrainian question to future generations. After all, the need to resolve it would always remain a major problem for Russia - for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of Ukraine as an anti-Russia and an outpost for Western pressure on us, is only the second in importance among them.

The first would always remain a complex of divided people, a complex of national humiliation - when the Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kiev), and then had to come to terms with the existence of two states no longer one, but two peoples. That is, either to abandon its history, agreeing with the crazy versions that ""only Ukraine is the real Russia,"" or to gnash their teeth helplessly, remembering the times when ""we lost Ukraine. Bringing Ukraine back, that is, turning it back to Russia, would be more and more difficult with each passing decade - the recoding, derussification of Russians, and the setting against Russian Little Russians-Ukrainians would gain momentum. And if full geopolitical and military control of the West over Ukraine were consolidated, its return to Russia would become impossible at all - it would have to fight the Atlantic bloc for it.

Now this problem is gone - Ukraine has returned to Russia. This does not mean that its statehood will be liquidated, but it will be restructured, re-established and returned to its natural state as part of the Russian world. In what borders, in what form will the union with Russia be fixed (through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus)? This will be decided after the end of the history of Ukraine as anti-Russia. In any case, the period of the split of the Russian people is coming to an end.

And here begins the second dimension of the coming new era - it concerns the relations between Russia and the West. Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, the three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, acting geopolitically as one whole. These relations have entered a new stage - the West sees Russia's return to its historical borders in Europe. And it loudly resents it, although deep in its heart it must admit that it could not be otherwise.

Did anyone in the old European capitals, Paris and Berlin, seriously believe that Moscow would give up Kiev? That Russians would forever be a divided people? And at the same time that Europe is uniting, when German and French elites are trying to seize control of European integration from the Anglo-Saxons and assemble a united Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe was only possible thanks to the unification of Germany, which happened by Russian good (albeit not very clever) will. To take a swing at the Russian land after that is the top of ingratitude, but of geopolitical stupidity. The West as a whole, and even more so Europe separately, did not have the strength to keep in its sphere of influence, let alone to take Ukraine. Not to understand this, one had to be just geopolitical fools.

More precisely, there was only one option: to bet on the further collapse of Russia, that is, the Russian Federation. But the fact that it did not work should have been clear twenty years ago. And fifteen years ago, after Putin's Munich speech, even the deaf could hear - Russia is coming back.

Now the West is trying to punish Russia for coming back, for not justifying its plans to profit at its expense, for not letting it expand its western space to the east. In seeking to punish us, the West thinks that relations with it are of vital importance to us. But that's not true anymore - the world has changed, and not just the Europeans, but the Anglo-Saxons who run the West, understand this very well. No Western pressure on Russia will get us anywhere. Both sides will suffer losses from the escalation of the confrontation, but Russia is ready for them morally and geopolitically. But for the West itself the rise in the degree of confrontation has enormous costs, and the main ones are not economic at all.

Europe, as part of the West, wanted autonomy - the German project of European integration does not make strategic sense while maintaining Anglo-Saxon ideological, military and geopolitical control over the Old World. And it cannot succeed, because the Anglo-Saxons need a controlled Europe. But Europe also needs autonomy for another reason - in case the United States moves to self-isolation (as a result of growing internal conflicts and contradictions) or concentrates on the Pacific region, where the geopolitical center of gravity is shifting.

But the confrontation with Russia, into which the Anglo-Saxons are dragging Europe, deprives Europeans of even a chance for autonomy - not to mention the fact that in the same way they are trying to impose on Europe a break with China. While the Atlanticists are now happy that the ""Russian threat"" will unite the Western bloc, those in Berlin and Paris cannot but understand that, having lost hope of autonomy, the European project will simply collapse in the medium term. That is why independent-minded Europeans are now completely uninterested in building a new iron curtain on their eastern borders - realizing that it will turn into a corral for Europe. Whose century (or rather half a millennium) of global leadership is in any case over - but various options for its future are still possible.

Because the construction of the new world order - and this is the third dimension of current events - is accelerating, and its contours are becoming clearer through the sprawling blanket of Anglo-Saxon globalization. The multipolar world has finally become a reality - the operation in Ukraine is unable to rally anyone but the West against Russia. Because the rest of the world can see and understand perfectly well - this is a conflict between Russia and the West, this is a response to the geopolitical expansion of the Atlanticists, this is Russia's return of its historical space and its place in the world.

China and India, Latin America and Africa, the Islamic world and Southeast Asia - no one believes that the West rules the world order, much less sets the rules of the game. Russia has not just challenged the West - it has shown that the era of Western global dominance can be considered fully and finally over. The new world will be built by all civilizations and centers of power, of course, together with the West (united or not) - but not on its terms and not by its rules.",ea7346b18694f0d3b49d055e76a058338e2e569b,True,False,,,,,0,1646056424,,0,{},hys04bu,False,t3_t3emvp,False,True,t3_t3emvp,/r/geopolitics/comments/t3emvp/russias_rianovosti_news_agency_accidentally/hys04bu/,1646056442,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646027624.0,

English translation follows.

A new world is being born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine has ushered in a new era - and in three dimensions at once. And of course, in the fourth, internal Russian. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but this is worth talking about separately a little later.

Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe in our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome. Yes, at a great cost, yes, through the tragic events of a virtual civil war, because now brothers, separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies, are still shooting at each other, but there will be no more Ukraine as anti-Russia. Russia is restoring its historical fullness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we had abandoned this, if we had allowed the temporary division to take hold for centuries, then we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.

Vladimir Putin has assumed, without a drop of exaggeration, a historic responsibility by deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian question to future generations. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the main problem for Russia - for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost for the West to put pressure on us, is only the second most important among them.

The first would always be the complex of a divided people, the complex of national humiliation - when the Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kiev), and then was forced to come to terms with the existence of two states, not one, but two peoples. That is, either to abandon their history, agreeing with the insane versions that ""only Ukraine is the real Russia,"" or to gnash one's teeth helplessly, remembering the times when ""we lost Ukraine."" Returning Ukraine, that is, turning it back to Russia, would be more and more difficult with every decade - recoding, de-Russification of Russians and inciting Ukrainian Little Russians against Russians would gain momentum.

Russia urges other countries to recognize DPR and LPR - MFA &gt;&gt;
Now this problem is gone - Ukraine has returned to Russia. This does not mean that its statehood will be liquidated, but it will be reorganized, re-established and returned to its natural state of part of the Russian world. Within what boundaries, in what form will the alliance with Russia be consolidated (through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus)? This will be decided after the end is put in the history of Ukraine as anti-Russia. In any case, the period of the split of the Russian people is coming to an end.

And here begins the second dimension of the coming new era - it concerns Russia's relations with the West. Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, acting in geopolitical terms as a single whole. These relations have entered a new stage - the West sees the return of Russia to its historical borders in Europe. And he is loudly indignant at this, although in the depths of his soul he must admit to himself that it could not be otherwise.

Did someone in the old European capitals, in Paris and Berlin, seriously believe that Moscow would give up Kyiv? That the Russians will forever be a divided people? And at the same time when Europe is uniting, when the German and French elites are trying to seize control of European integration from the Anglo-Saxons and assemble a united Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe became possible only thanks to the unification of Germany, which took place according to the good Russian (albeit not very smart) will. To swipe after that also on Russian lands is not even the height of ingratitude, but of geopolitical stupidity. The West as a whole, and even more so Europe in particular, did not have the strength to keep Ukraine in its sphere of influence, and even more so to take Ukraine for itself. In order not to understand this, one had to be just geopolitical fools.

More precisely, there was only one option: to bet on the further collapse of Russia, that is, the Russian Federation. But the fact that it did not work should have been clear twenty years ago. And already fifteen years ago, after Putin's Munich speech, even the deaf could hear - Russia is returning.

Now the West is trying to punish Russia for the fact that it returned, for not justifying its plans to profit at its expense, for not allowing the expansion of the western space to the east. Seeking to punish us, the West thinks that relations with it are of vital importance to us. But this has not been the case for a long time - the world has changed, and this is well understood not only by Europeans, but also by the Anglo-Saxons who rule the West. No amount of Western pressure on Russia will lead to anything. There will be losses from the sublimation of confrontation on both sides, but Russia is ready for them morally and geopolitically. But for the West itself, an increase in the degree of confrontation incurs huge costs - and the main ones are not at all economic.

Europe, as part of the West, wanted autonomy - the German project of European integration does not make strategic sense while maintaining the Anglo-Saxon ideological, military and geopolitical control over the Old World. Yes, and it cannot be successful, because the Anglo-Saxons need a controlled Europe. But Europe needs autonomy for another reason as well — in case the States go into self-isolation (as a result of growing internal conflicts and contradictions) or focus on the Pacific region, where the geopolitical center of gravity is moving.

But the confrontation with Russia, into which the Anglo-Saxons are dragging Europe, deprives the Europeans of even the chances of independence - not to mention the fact that in the same way Europe is trying to impose a break with China. If now the Atlanticists are happy that the ""Russian threat"" will unite the Western bloc, then in Berlin and Paris they cannot fail to understand that, having lost hope for autonomy, the European project will simply collapse in the medium term. That is why independent-minded Europeans are now completely uninterested in building a new iron curtain on their eastern borders - realizing that it will turn into a corral for Europe. Whose century (more precisely, half a millennium) of global leadership is over in any case - but various options for its future are still possible.
Because the construction of a new world order - and this is the third dimension of current events - is accelerating, and its contours are more and more clearly visible through the spreading cover of Anglo-Saxon globalization. A multipolar world has finally become a reality - the operation in Ukraine is not capable of rallying anyone but the West against Russia. Because the rest of the world sees and understands perfectly well - this is a conflict between Russia and the West, this is a response to the geopolitical expansion of the Atlanticists, this is Russia's return of its historical space and its place in the world.

China and India, Latin America and Africa, the Islamic world and Southeast Asia - no one believes that the West leads the world order, much less sets the rules of the game. Russia has not only challenged the West, it has shown that the era of Western global domination can be considered completely and finally over. The new world will be built by all civilizations and centers of power, naturally, together with the West (united or not) - but not on its terms and not according to its rules.",3a651d51b94a61d33d74e095d228c50f538ca743,True,False,,,,,0,1646040518,,0,{},hyrckc2,True,t3_t3bn99,False,True,t3_t3bn99,/r/geopolitics/comments/t3bn99/moscows_bizarre_attempt_to_justify_a_war_on/hyrckc2/,1646040532,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646011718.0,

I don't think US options were limited, i think it could've deterred if it actually managed to deploy 100k NATO troops (with no more than 20k US to make it sustainable) around west of Ukraine and be ambiguous about whether it would help Ukraine while this thing dragged on. Putin is not a crazy man, hes a calculating man; thats why he denied denied and denied about his forces in Crimea until too late. He's not looking to go head on NATO if he thinks theres a chance that NATO would stand ground. But when Biden said from beginning theres no US troops to defend Ukraine it made it tempting for him. In his mind, NATO was going to sanction him for this or that so might as hell attempt to get something valuable like Ukraine in the mean time.

Until recently I always thought Putin was the cold calculative logical type. His words, demeanor and actions all made it seem so. Adversarial and antagonistic sure, but always in self interest. 

1. Then there was this recent video of him railing about NATO closing on on Russia and the question of European security. He seemed very animated, almost comical. He'd spoken about the exact same topic long back at a Munich conference, and made the same point in his usual quiet fashion. 

2. There's this other recent video of him dressing down the intelligence chief. Borderline embarrassing him. No sane leader/politician treats an intelligence chief that way. Nor surrounds themselves with yes men. Sieving through the initial reports it appears consistent that neither Russian soldiers Nor the command expected much resistance. Extrapolating backwards, it could only be possible if the highest level either believed or was asked to believe that most Ukrainians would welcome a change in government. 

3. The very recent video of him about escalating the nuclear alert level. The left eyelid seemed to be moving involuntarily often. In the same video the generals he's addressing seemed visibly uncomfortable. 

What are the odds this indicates a recent change in physical / mental health status? Admittedly I haven't seen too many videos of him live but still.

Yes, Minister Serdyukov indeed reformed the army [from 2007-2012]. He increased its efficiency, fought with corrupt and crony armament producers improving the army supplies. As a result he became extremely unpopular, made tons of powerful enemies and was ousted in 2012 losing his power and status.

*If I have to put it in an example, it will be like someone  demanding you not to join the third party which is his main rival while pointing a knife on your neck. Do we have right to refuse? Yes, but there is no guarantee that the knife wielder would not stab you. With West, the third party simply give a knife to fight back instead of personally helping the fight after saying he would give us support or free to choose also provoking the knife wielder.*

That is his basis for this matter, might and security interest took priority than Abstract right in International relationship. Weaker country needs to understand that concept and tread carefully in International issue by considering other involved countries reaction. 

So for me this idea at least is not about looking for something to blame, it is about finding out the best strategy to avoid conflict while still developing your country.

As a note, yes I still consider the agressor as in Russia as the biggest source of issue. the point is instead of facing its threat head on, it might be better to go around it.",548c9fbcea52fb17213ae04249f052cff24b1f59,True,False,,,,,0,1646018917,,0,{},hyqe9p6,False,t3_t0cgvt,False,True,t1_hyq1kb6,/r/geopolitics/comments/t0cgvt/ukraine_megathread_all_new_posts_go_here_so_long/hyqe9p6/,1646018935,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1645990117.0,

If you know the enemy has limited supplies/arms/time to hold out with you can send in less expensive, older equipment, and less trained units as a sponge. - The Cannon fodder theory.

It serves a few purposes

1) you learn the enemies tactics and capabilities before having your more prized units ambushed and surprised. 

2) you use up enemy logistics and munitions

3) you purge old equipment and less important units you don't plan/need to keep around

4) if you have time you can wear them out in a war of attrition then hammer them when they're close to breaking.

This is a very cold look at it and I don't think that's what they're doing but those are things off the top of my head.

This is for a number of reasons, firstly to deter nations from piling on with the sanctions/military aid and secondly to sure up avoidance of any sort of direct NATO intervention in Ukraine. 

Moreover, there is also the angle that the comment was said more in aim for Russian media digestion, as it has been framed there as him putting nuclear forces on alert after the west threatened nuclear strikes first (this is the current media line in Russia). 

There is growing sentiment in western media that Putin has lost his mind, I personally do not buy that and I personally do not believe the chance, as it stands, of the use of nuclear weapons is possible in Ukraine.

Meanwhile Russia benefited from ostensibly closer relations with Turkey.

But both countries have fundamentally different goals and are competing in influence over the Black Sea and the Middle East.

That's why Turkey has already supported Ukraine, likely sent it more equipment and closed the Bosphorus to Russian ships, recognizing Putin's invasion as a war. 

Erdogan himself also called for a stronger response from NATO countries. It's his opportunity to knock Russia down a peg and get himself some good press in the West for a change.

Some of Nato countries blamed Turkey. There was just Uk that talk directly to support Turkey. Some of people from Eu want to kick off Turkey from Nato. Some of Nato countries attack Libya but same countries didn't allow operation to Assad regime. Assad used chemical weapons but Obama prefered to discuss it with Russia and Russia took chemicals from Assad to make Assad not to use them.

Turkey apologized from Russia because there was a huge economical affect to Turkey also security risks. Russian are most tourist who visit Turkey. British and German tourist prefer another countries. German and British tourism companies made bad news about Turkey. I remember that i have seen a few British couple in Turkey and they told me that they heard lot of negative things from British officials and tourism companies and their medias. They have said any new tourist will not come to Turkey because they are afraid. Lot of people tried to cancel our tourism plans but theybvisit every year and they know how it is.

Russia is not the number one concern of the US nor it should be. I'm not saying we should ignore Russia altogether but I'm saying it shouldn't be the main concern. As far as I know, China is that number one concern which they can really become a surpassing economic and competing military power by the 2030s, followed by a real possibility for war in the Taiwan straits. If the US's strategy is to contain China, I believe we are doing the complete opposite by unnecessarily expanding NATO to Russia's borders and poking the bear. I believe we should take a more pragmatic stance and take Russia's geopolitical concerns a little more seriously and respect their distance instead of reaching into their underbelly with Ukraine. I am NOT justifying Russia's invasion of Ukraine as I believe it is a very inefficient method of repelling Ukraine from NATO. There was a real chance a decade ago to have Russia join or at least align interests with the West against China but I think there is no going back after the invasion especially if Russia does get kicked out of SWIFT. Russia will increasingly depend on China and may play a future role in China's continued rise to power on the international stage, if I may borrow from another comment on this thread, as their ""junior partner"" or China and Russia will play good cop, bad cop, respectively. Of course, this is speculation but I don't see any other way in which the West and Russia will return back to good terms after their costly adventure into Ukraine, I can only see a future where Russia will increase their dependence on China. The sort of ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" type relationship.

I believe China is a factor behind the scenes regarding the decision to invade Ukraine as to whether China will stay neutral and to what extent it will economically respond to Russia. Right now, China is paying CLOSE attention to the invasion, the international response, modern urban warfare tactics, and possibly an occupation because this will all be very useful information regarding their affairs with Taiwan. I'm not saying Taiwan and Ukraine are the same but they are definitely related in this narrative of ""big bad guy bullies small weaker guy"" and learning from Ukraine is a major lesson they can incorporate without doing anything.",d637f210fbf6368e42095b335b9d97f02b54d8f2,True,False,,,,,0,1646006954,,0,{},hypoaa3,False,t3_t020va,False,True,t3_t020va,/r/geopolitics/comments/t020va/russia_invasion_of_ukraine_live_thread/hypoaa3/,1646006970,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1645978154.0,
