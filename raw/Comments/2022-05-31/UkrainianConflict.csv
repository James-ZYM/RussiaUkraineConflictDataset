So with 3K 100% officially confirmed dead just in this article you can easily add at least same amount from smaller villages all over ruzzia with no internet and no social media to report their death.  Now we are talking 6-7K, and these are just the bodies that were collected and returned home. Mayor of Dnipro said that in his city alone he had almost 2000 bodies of dead ruzzians, add few other big  cities ( like Kyiv or Har'kiv)  with similar or smaller amount of corpse picked by Ukrainians . Which brings the number to lets say 10-12K. And don't forget about all the convoys which burned to the ground and tanks blowing the gaskets, there is nothing left there to collect or identify, just ashes (if any). Top it off with these who are just died in the field and their remainings were destroyed by animals and what is left buried by Ukrainians by pound not by body. I remember this video when Ukrainian tractor carrying a load of body parts all together, no one ever bothered to count how many people are there.  Sprinkle some MIAs from their warships, and conscripts from ""peoples republics"" (no one counts these in ruzzia) on tops and the number will get somewhere close to 25K.

Western sanctions against Russia are motivated by “hatred”, according to a former Russian president with close links to Vladimir Putin.

Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of the country’s security council, also alleged that sanctions against the country are aimed at hurting ordinary Russian people.

He wrote on the Telegram messenger app on Tuesday: “They hate us all! The basis for these decisions is hatred for Russia, for Russians and for all its inhabitants.”
Despite that, Medvedev claimed sanctions are not affecting the political elite and won't be “fatal” for big business, but are “directed precisely against the people of Russia”.

Western measures affecting oil and gas are aimed at forcing the government to introduce budget cuts, he said, adding: “An embargo on buying oil and gas from Russia? The same thing: to reduce the budget incomes and force the state to abandon its social obligations such as raising payments in line with inflation.”",11152e1a3e301292e724fdafbea94d763f49ce9e,True,False,,,,,0,1654038964,,0,{},iapz886,False,t3_v21v2e,False,True,t3_v21v2e,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v21v2e/they_hate_us_all_claims_former_russian_leader_in/iapz886/,1654038976,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654010164.0,

I'm saying that's how Russia will portray the situation and enough people will buy it to not want to start another war, assuming Russia just declares victory with with they've got and just sign some sort of peace deal. China also doesn't care about Ukraine because if Russia was able to take it over, that would have given China the confidence to be able to do the same with Taiwan. Of course that's not going to happen now since they've seen what Russia is doing in Ukraine and Taiwan is way richer than Ukraine with much higher military capabilities and better terrain as well as being a literal island.  

Again, you seriously don't seem to understand that there's a difference between helping a country being invaded and helping a country trying to ""invade"" parts of another nuclear nation. You also don't seem to get that the US is about to go through a recission and giving tens of billions of dollars to a country in order to recapture a few husks of cities that they don't have the money to rebuild isn't exactly going to be a popular move. 

The most recent polls has already shown a slipage for the amount money being given and that's trend is going to go further as the recission and inflation start to really set in. Don't get me wrong, that support will continue as long as Russia doesn't want to make peace but if they consolidate and incorporate what they have than it's going to turn into a trickle. 

I'm assuming many of those partisans will want to go back Ukraine if they do incorporate the country. And if Russia was smart, they would allow that in a hearth beat. But let's say they don't and they want to fight for their villages instead of just moving to Ukraine proper, well it's not like Eastern Ukraine is Afghanistan or Vietnam. The geography will make it extremely hard to wage any kind of effective insurgence for a long period of time against a concentrated enemy with superior fire power (this is where those old ass tanks come in useful).

It takes a few weeks to learn them sure, but to properly fix them, find replacement parts, try to get the logistical routes in order to bring parts from a Boeing factory to the front lines in Ukraine and doing it over and over and over again will take months to master and even than, they'll be decent targets for Russian air power. So it's going to take 6 months to  a year in order to have the numbers and mastery needed to effectively use them in large scale offence operations.

If you think the demographics in Russia aren't great for general mobilization, just look at Ukraine. The only difference is one has a population four times larger than the other one. They could also sell ""defending the new areas of the Russian motherland"" much easier than ""we have to defeat our brotherly country who is over run by Nazi's despite being run by a Jewish president and we don't care how many people we kill to do it.""

Russia isn't going to do that and they're not in some death spiral. At least not for decades to come. China and India have already jumped all over that cheap oil and gas which will further grow their economies and allow them to buy even more oil and gas. How do you think Germany became the power it did today? Cheap oil and gas from Russia was a biiig part of that. Not to mention that in terms of world powers, Russia is still in the top 4-5 country despite how humiliating this is for them. I mean if you think Russia is a paper tiger, just wait and see the Chinese army.

So once America forced ukranians to protest in maidan, even though the brave russian guards were sniping them from the rooftops, yanukovic conceeded to hold elections again.

This was the first part of america's devious coup. The second part was way worse: they forced ukranians to hold a free and fair election, and a chocolatier won. That's how you know it was fake: Americans love chocolate, it's basically their calling card.

But the americans weren't done yet. They reactivated the banderite nationalists who had lain low during almost a century of rule from moscow. These are very old men. And Nazis. And Soros was one of them, you can tell because he's also very old. (Is it any coincidence that Biden is also old? No.)

So now the Americans got the Nazis to put up a candidate for elections which were also recognised as free and fair, and they picked the Jewish comedian from the telly - Americans love TV of course.

Ukrainians voted for the Jewish guy, which totally destroyed their neutrality because now nothing was stopping the maidan generation from persuing closer ties with the west, which is not neutral unless they also persue closer ties with the east - a typical american paradox.

All so simple really, in hindsight. America overthrew yanukovic by forcing the chocolatier to hold open elections which he didn't win, allowing the 90 year old Nazis who lived through Soviet purges to reactivate their Jewish TV comedians, which destroyed all hope for neutrality.

""One may dislike Hitler’s system and yet admire his patriotic achievement. If our country were defeated I hope we should find a champion as indomitable to restore our courage and lead us back to our place among the nations. I have on more than one occasion made my appeal in public that the Führer of Germany should now become the Hitler of peace.""

- Winston Churchill, Leader of Britain on Adolf Hitler

""The story of that struggle (Hitler's rise to power), cannot be read without admiration for the courage, the perseverance, and the vital force which enabled him to challenge, defy, conciliate or overcome, all the authority or resistances which barred his path."". 

Also Churchill, literally the leader and representative of all of Britain

“‘I will, however, say a word on the international aspect of Fascismo. Externally, your movement has rendered a service to the whole world. (...) Italy has shown that there is a way of fighting the subversive forces which can rally the mass of the people, properly led, to value and wish to defend the honour and stability of civilised society.

431,[],False,,Enrage,,,[],,,,text,t2_5k2af,False,False,"The fact that you keep on saying “invade Russia” instead of “recapture occupied Ukraine” shows you have to be insane. No one, not even China, will accept Ukraine becoming part of Russia. Everyone is afraid of territorial disputes, and supporting it opens Pandora’s box against themselves. “Oh, Taiwan just declared independence decided to become the 51st US state”-type stuff. The sooner you accept that, the easier it will be for you.

The US and the UK are “in it to win it”. To support Ukraine at the current level ($20bn for 4 months) is 15% of the US defense budget. You think they aren’t going to keep that pouring in the defeat Russia, who has actively worked against US interests for decades? Without having to put boots on the ground? Putin blundered into a huge strategic defeat of his own making and they are going to take that deal 10 out of 10 times. All the while the war is showing how poor Russian equipment is and the superiority of Western weapons, driving additional US weapons sales? Oh yeah, everything is politically aligned in support of Ukraine winning 

You’re also forgetting that the people living in those areas don’t want to be part of Russia and are actively fighting a partisan war as well. Russia will be fighting a guerilla war in their rear and a conventional war on their front. The “referendums” have already been pushed back several times because the “leaders” in those areas know they won’t survive more than a few days after they announce it, just like the recent car bombing.

Also, it doesn’t take “months” to train on US equipment. It only takes weeks. M777 training was 1 week. MLRS training is 2 weeks. Training a brand new soldier on an Abrams is 5 weeks in peacetime, and much less in wartime.

Russia cannot mobilize because its politically unacceptable in Russia. If mobilization could have happened, it would have. That’s why they are trying every trick to “stealth mobilize”, but an Army of alcoholic, overweight 50 year olds frightens no one. Even if mobilization was politically acceptable in Russia, the demographics gap in Russia means Russia is much weaker than the 144 million population suggest. Just yesterday Russian propagandists admitted Russia “doesn’t have much young people”.

Russia can stop the war anytime. They can just walk away, go back to their former energy export partners hat in hand, get on their knees and beg forgiveness, and maybe they may be allowed a return to status quo ante. Otherwise, Russia is already in a death spiral. It might take months, it might take years, but Russia as we know it is surely dead. Moscow ruled large areas due to their “strength”, but the one thing this war has made clear is that Moscow is very, very weak. Every time that has happened in Russian history, Russia has fallen apart. 30 years ago Russia was very weak and hemorrhages Poland, Ukraine, the Baltics, part of the Balkans.

But OTOH they've also achieved some major victories, i.e. the conquest of Kherson, Mariupol, Melitopol, and about 90% of the Donbas.  And thus when the average Russian looks at the whole balance sheet I don't see any evidence that they feel humiliated.  Overall, from their perspective, they've conquered a significant part of Ukraine and they continue to advance.  You can of course believe they that they have been humiliated, but I don't think they care about what you and I think.  And that's my main point, regardless of what you and I think or feel, the evidence I see is that they intend to keep on fighting, humiliated or not.     

NATO is heavily supporting Ukraine by providing weapons, supplies, equipment, economic assistance, intelligence, and probably a lot of other things we don't know about.  So yes, they are facing NATO, they're just not actively engaging NATO forces.  Whether you agree or not, the Russians see it as the same thing.  

What do I think the ratio is when only those who are willing to risk their lives are included?  That's a good question.  Right now it's impossible to give a good answer.  All I can see is that both sides are fighting, sometimes gaining ground, sometimes losing it.  Neither side has collapsed.  And neither side is showing signs of collapse.  Given that Ukraine is fighting for its very existence, I would think that more Ukrainians are willing to risk their lives then Russians.  OTOH, the average Russian sees Ukraine as an integral part of Russia, which is a very emotional issue for them.  Only time can tell who has the stronger will.

Anyway, I don't want to get bogged down with you discussing words, so i'll just post a link to the wikipedia article on asymmetric warfare (just a quick Google-search away, as you prescribed). I quote:

I can definitely see Western Europe wavering big time, as the cost of living is the core political issue there, a lot of countries would be willing to turn a blind eye in order for an easy life.

Though the USA could be a bit more immune to this, as it's much more self sufficient in food &amp; energy, and they are the biggest source of military aid by far, as long as they stay onboard the loss of enthusiasm in Western Europe could be mitigated.

&gt;I hope this doesn't happen, but the only way I see for them to turn this around is to regain some significant territory in a big counterattack, in the very near future. It would have to be to retake Kherson Oblast and threaten Crimea land access, or retake some significant part of Donbass, or (miraculously) Mariupol.

I hope you're right, but I don't think they have the means? They'd presumably need to take out a lot of Russian air power, which is probably based quite deep behind enemy lines, in order to make big advances &amp; sustain them?

They seem to be trying to brainwash the Russian population into accepting war.  And that has worked on the older Russians who only watch state-run tv. The latest 1420 video asking Russians if they believe the war in Ukraine was necessary shows a clear divide that the older Russians actually believe the war was necessary - and not just because of some hogwash about Ukrainian ""Nazis"" killing ethnic Russians in Donbass but actual fear that if Russia didn't attack Ukraine, then Russia would be attacked by Ukraine or NATO.  Thus these brainwashed older Russians do seem to feel like the war is justified to keep themselves safe.

I'm not sure if these Russian media idiots do actually follow what's happening because it doesn't benefit them. They might want western news reports to know how to spin the news to dismiss it (it's all fake with actors and special effects, it's the Ukrainians bombing themselves, Neo-Nazis are to blame, or whatever else).  

But a lot of these idiots really do believe the lies they are peddling. And I'm worried they would like to live in the fantasy world they imagine where Russia defeats the west.  They can easily convince older Russians of that fantasy where war is necessary and thus the losses are acceptable.  But are they also so brainwashed themselves that they believe Russia can actually win WWII?

Is literally the first sentence in the article that you linked lol. Where tf does it say ""in training"" hmmmm?

Yea because they can't convince the people who don't give a shit about the situation (like China and India) that dropping nukes on another country was a good look. Dropping nukes in your own territory after a Western backed nation attacks? Well that's a different story. You don't seem to be getting that. 

Again the difference is that America didn't annex Vietnam or Afghanistan. Same with Russia. They set up a puppet government, send in men to defend it but both South Vietnam and communist Afghanistan were still independent nations. Like do you seriously not understand that? And even they don't use nukes, well than conscription kicks in and now you have a battle of who could bleed more, the country with 36 million people are the country with 140 million. Either way, not a good outcome. 

Yea because of the few dozen planes shots down, some of them were over the age of 30. That means they're running out of pilots right? No what they're running out of are junior and intermediate officers, hence them dipping into their veterans from previous wars to fill in the gaps. It's not good but it's not nearly as dire as people make it out to be.

No they don't. They still have to run the country as well and a million men is pushing it to the absolute limit and will take at least a few years before actually getting there, well 1.5 million is just out of the question. Even with conscription. Just the logistics needed to constantly supply that amount of men with bullets, food, medicine, oil etc. is waaay beyond the capabilities of Ukraine, especially now after their gdp is cut in half and they have half a trillion dollars+ in damages.

That US gear will help A LOT but not only do they need months of training to properly use, but also to fix up and assuming that every penny goes towards just gear and not the dozens of other things that Ukraine has to do to keep itself running. America isn't going to foot the costs for ever and most certainly won't do so to invade Russian territory. They want Russia to bleed and bleed a lot well looking like the good guy, not to do what is seemingly an act of war.",55b22effd53310812f32d7992bc968d2b25469db,True,False,,,,,0,1654033434,,0,{},iapnbsk,False,t3_v1rs2m,False,True,t1_iaozfsj,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v1rs2m/putins_hard_choices_why_the_russian_despot_can/iapnbsk/,1654033445,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654004634.0,

Ukraine is now pushing Russian troops north and east from Kharkiv, “in some cases all the way back to Russia,” said retired Gen. Philip Breedlove, the former supreme allied commander for Europe. “So now Ukrainians are threatening to cut off Russian lines of supply and pushing their forces to the rear.”

Cutting off Russian supply lines east of Kharkiv would put Russian troops in the same situation they were in after their advance on Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, at the beginning of the war, officials said. Ukrainian units carrying shoulder-fired Javelin antitank missiles picked off Russian soldiers as miles-long Russian convoys near Kyiv stopped moving forward. The invasion stalled, and thousands of Russian troops were killed or injured. Russia then refocused its mission on the east.

In the early weeks of the war, Russia ran its military campaign out of Moscow, with no central war commander on the ground to call the shots, American and other Western officials said. In early April, after Russia’s logistics and morale problems had become clear, Mr. Putin put General Dvornikov in charge of a streamlined war effort.

General Dvornikov arrived with a daunting résumé. He started his career as a platoon commander in 1982 and later fought in Russia’s brutal second war in Chechnya. Moscow also sent him to Syria, where the forces under his command were accused of targeting civilians.

In Ukraine, he established a more streamlined process. Russian pilots began coordinating with troops on the ground toward a similar objective in the eastern region of Donbas, and Russian units were talking to one another about shared goals.

On the ground. Fighting raged in Sievierodonetsk, the last city in the Luhansk region to remain outside Russian control since the war efforts shifted to the east of the country. Though most of the city’s civilian population has fled in the past few weeks, 12,000 people, many of them elderly, are said to be trapped there in appalling conditions.

Russian oil embargo. European Union members finally reached an agreement on a Russian oil embargo and new sanctions against Russia. The long-delayed deal effectively exempts Hungary, which had opposed the embargo, from the costly step the rest of the bloc is taking to punish Russia.

Grain exports. Following the agreement, European leaders are now focusing on ways to prop up Ukraine’s economy, including unblocking huge amounts of grain stuck at Ukrainian ports that are under Russian blockade. Russia’s foreign minister is expected to visit Turkey next week to discuss the possible release of the grain.

Second war crime trial. A Ukrainian court sentenced two Russian soldiers to 11 and a half years in prison for shelling a town in the country’s northeast during the war. It was the second guilty verdict handed down by Ukrainian courts for war crimes since the invasion began.

But the invasion is not “proceeding particularly differently in the east than in the west because they haven’t been able to change the character of the Russian army,” said Frederick W. Kagan, a senior fellow and director of the Critical Threats Project at the American Enterprise Institute. “There are some deep flaws in the Russian army that they could not have repaired in the last few weeks even if they had tried. The flaws are deep and fundamental.”

At the top of that list is the Russian army’s lack of a noncommissioned officers corps empowered to think for itself, Pentagon officials said. American troops have sergeants and platoon leaders and corporals who are given tasks and guidelines and left to accomplish those tasks as they see fit.

But Russia’s military follows a Soviet-style doctrinal method in which troops at the bottom are not empowered to point out flaws in strategy that should be obvious or to make adjustments.

The Ukrainians, after seven years of training alongside troops from the United States and other NATO countries, follow the more Western method and have proved particularly agile at adapting to circumstances, American military officials said.

A two-week fighting pause after the Russian military gave up the fight for Kyiv was not long enough to turn the campaign around, even with a more limited goal, General Breedlove said. General Dvornikov’s “new tactics, resetting the command and control so there was a focused decision maker — all that was right or proper,” he said.

But, General Breedlove added: “Even our army would be hard-pressed to refit, refurbish and reorganize in two weeks after having received such a sound whipping.” When General Dvornikov took control, “the force was thrust back into the battle too quickly. That decision had to have come from Moscow.”

After renewing an assault on the Donbas, Russia has pounded cities and villages with a barrage of artillery. But troops have not followed that up with any kind of sustained armored invasion, which is necessary if they will hold the territory they are flattening, military officials say. That means that Russia may find itself struggling to hold on to gains — as it did in Kharkiv.

Evelyn Farkas, a former senior Pentagon official for Ukraine and Russia in the Obama administration, said Mr. Putin was still too involved in the fight.

“We keep hearing accounts of Putin getting more involved,” said Ms. Farkas, who is now executive director of the McCain Institute. “We know that if you have presidents meddling in targeting and operational military decisions, it’s a recipe for disaster.”",1e014c29ffdd1aebdc2870b1efed42a5ed42e877,True,False,,,,,0,1654032858,,0,{},iapm1wv,True,t3_v20pvs,False,True,t1_iaplzbf,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v20pvs/russian_military_is_repeating_mistakes_in_eastern/iapm1wv/,1654032876,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654004058.0,

Russian Military Is Repeating Mistakes in Eastern Ukraine, U.S. Says
May 31, 2022, 4:08 p.m. ET, Helene Cooper

WASHINGTON — Seven weeks after sending a new commander to Ukraine to oversee a refocused invasion, Russia faces a truth that a former American defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, defined as the necessity of going to war with the army you have, not the one you might wish to have.

The Russian military, beaten down and demoralized after three months of war, is making the same mistakes in its campaign to capture a swath of eastern Ukraine that forced it to abandon its push to take the entire country, senior American officials say.

While Russian troops are capturing territory, a Pentagon official said that their “plodding and incremental” pace was wearing them down, and that the military’s overall fighting strength had been diminished by about 20 percent. And since the war started, Russia has lost 1,000 tanks, a senior Pentagon official said last week.

Gen. Aleksandr V. Dvornikov, the commander, was appointed in April in what was widely viewed as an acknowledgment by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia that his initial war plan was failing.

Soon after his appointment, General Dvornikov tried to get disjointed air and land units to coordinate their attacks, American officials said. But he has not been seen in the past two weeks, leading some officials to speculate as to whether he remains in charge of the war effort.

Russian pilots also continue to demonstrate the same risk-averse behavior they did in the early weeks of the war: darting across the border to launch strikes and then quickly returning to Russian territory, instead of staying in Ukrainian air space to deny access to their foes. The result is that Russia still has not established any kind of air superiority, officials said.

The Russian military has made some progress in the east, where concentrated firepower and shortened supply lines have helped its forces fight intense battles in recent days. After three bloody months, Russia finally took Mariupol in mid-May, potentially creating a land bridge from the Russian-controlled Crimean Peninsula to the south.

As Russia struggles to move forward, Ukraine has also suffered setbacks. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine recently said that as many as 100 Ukrainian servicemen might be dying every day in the fighting. And on Tuesday, Russian troops advanced toward the center of Sievierodonetsk, a city that has become a central focus for the military since it shifted its attention to the east.

But some of the areas that Russian forces managed to seize have been quickly contested again, and sometimes retaken, by Ukrainian troops.

Consider Kharkiv. Russia spent six weeks bombarding the eastern city, once home to 1.5 million people, as troops encircled it.

But by May 13, control of the city had flipped again. “The Russians took Kharkiv for a short period of time; the Ukrainians counterattacked and took Kharkiv back,” Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III said at a news conference at the Pentagon last week. “We’ve seen them really proceed at a very slow and unsuccessful pace on the battlefield.”",c29b416fceaf08f90ebbbd7c6832d2c188c36ffd,True,False,,,,,0,1654032828,,0,{},iaplzbf,True,t3_v20pvs,False,True,t3_v20pvs,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v20pvs/russian_military_is_repeating_mistakes_in_eastern/iaplzbf/,1654032846,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654004028.0,

Like I said in another comment, I didn't think that war was germane to this discussion because the Russian people never saw Afghanistan as part of the motherland.  That's a major difference between that war and this one in Ukraine.  Many Russians see Ukraine as part of the Rodina and thus unlike Afghanistan they are emotionally and patriotically invested in it.  I would expect that just like WW1 and 2 they will be much more willing to sacrifice to win in Ukraine then they ever were to win in Afghanistan.

I would humbly offer that the USSR was already in serious economic straights even before they invaded Afghanistan in 1979.  The cost of the war certainly didn't help matters, but I think Mikhail Gorbachev's policies of perestroika and glasnost is what pushed them over the edge.  The USSR had already pulled all of its troops out of Afghanistan in 1989.  The fall of the Soviet Union didn't happen until two years later in 1991 when multiple republics, lead by Estonia, declared independence.  In the end what destroyed the Soviet Union wasn't its economic problems or the war, but the fact that most of its population did not want to be a part of it.",0bbfa0ab492cff242a4f4d2c0e00f1e655e3448a,True,False,,,,,0,1654032751,,0,{},iapltau,False,t3_v16aaf,False,True,t1_iaoi8pr,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v16aaf/russia1_tv_special_operation_is_over_ww3_began_we/iapltau/,1654032762,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654003951.0,

My dude, you started with US imperialism (which makes no sense as the US isn’t annexing Ukraine, Russia is. Now you’re saying NATO is pulling the strings even though it’s the only thing stopping Putin from pushing east and invading former soviet states. 

Who’s next, a global cabal of elites that are pushing for war to rapidly depopulate the planet in the ultimate act of eugenics? Lol 

You’re talking to someone who knows all the conspiracies, I used to watch Alex Jones for keks until he became creepy. 

If there really was a shadowy elite pulling all the strings, I’m sure they could do a better job at it than Russia trying to spread its influence by military force (by the way literally imperialism) and it’s the US pulling all the strings because of its own imperialism lol 

Let me try and understand you. US imperialism is forcing NATO to push Russia to be imperialistic? And there’s a shadowy elite that is pulling the strings? What we talking here, Soros? Lizard people?

The Ukrainian embassy in the Czech Rep. opened an account for Czech people (civilians) to donate money (1). What the headline says relates to this account, that since the start of the war, Czech people donatemillin euro to this account. Further confirmation of that can be seen here  ""‎People and organizations have sent more than CZK 1.1 billion to the account of the Ukrainian Embassy in Prague since the beginning of the war. The vast majority has already been used to buy weapons and military equipment, Ambassador Yevhen Perebyjnis said today.‎"" (2) Note that this also states that most of that money was used to buy weapons.   


What I was saying about the howitzer example is that these were bought (3) for Ukraine. ""‎Tractors with covered military equipment heading to Ukraine were again spotted in Olomouc this week. Already from the pictures it is clear that it is a transport of tracked vehicles, well recognizable is also a long cannon. After reviewing the proportions, these are most likely self-propelled Soviet howitzers 2S1 Gvozdika, in translation Carnation.""

We do not know for sure if these were paid for using the donation, but the argument I am making here is that Ukraine is receiving money from Czech civilians to buy weapons and someone recently bought these howitzers for Ukraine in the Czech Rep., it is likely that the money was used for this. If not, there are other weapons they are buying here, this is one example of what was bought for Ukraine in the Czech Rep. and so the money could have been used to buy among other things these howitzers

&gt; The Security Service of Ukraine reports on the exposure of Russian agents and collaborators on the territory of Ukraine.

&gt; Details: Since the beginning of the full-scale aggression by the Russian Federation, the Ukrainian special service has exposed more than 360 Russian agents and more than 5,000 collaborators.

NOW THAT’S A HOT MIC

Two high-ranking Russian military officers have been caught shit-talking Kremlin leadership in unimaginably colorful language. The two colonels blast the defense minister and lash out at that “motherfucker” Vladimir Putin for his poor strategy in Ukraine, according to a leaked recording of a phone conversation.
While Western and Ukrainian intelligence agencies have routinely reported on plunging morale among rank-and-file Russian troops fighting in Ukraine, many of whom have been heard complaining of dysfunction in intercepted communications, the latest audio appears to be the first to expose frustrations among high-ranking officers.

Radio Free Europe’s Ukrainian service published the curse-laden recording late Monday, reporting that it was provided by Ukrainian intelligence. One of the men heard in the purported intercepted call—identified as Colonel Maksim Vlasov—is no stranger to the eight-year war in Ukraine’s Donbas. He has been wanted by Ukrainian authorities since 2018 for the 2015 shelling of Mariupol—an attack in which he previously implicated himself by carelessly blabbing about it by phone in an earlier intercepted phone call covered by Bellingcat.
The latest recording, dated April 14, is said to show Vlasov and another colonel, Vitaly Kovtun, a doctor at the Naro-Fominsk military hospital said to hold many military honors, raging against the many failures of Putin’s “special military operation” in Ukraine.

They both express particular ire for Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu.

“There are horrible losses of our guys, fuck. And you know, I am familiar with military history a bit, and I compare this to the fucking Soviet-Finnish war of 1939-1940. It’s fucking one and the same,” said Vlasov, referring to a war in which the Soviets are estimated to have lost 126,875 troops.
He goes on to take aim at Shoigu, whom he describes as an “incompetent fucking layman.”
“He’s a layman in his work. This is not his fucking thing. He’s just a fucking showman,” the man identified as Vlasov says.
Kovtun responds in kind, saying, “Shoigu is fucking shit. [There are] no contracted forces. Of course not! Why would there fucking be? They paid them 30,000 rubles [$490], where are they going to get contractees?”

The pair also takes aim at the military leadership they say the Kremlin has put in charge in Ukraine.
“Shoigu has assembled all these fucked up [Emergency Situations] guys… if we have head of inspection Colonel-General [Pavel] Plat, fuck, he’s never even served in the army…” Vlasov said.
“They’ve brought forth a whole stellar cast of bootlickers. That [Alexander} Dvornikov is a legend of fuckery… He’s the one who thought up this ‘anti-Banderov push,’” he said, apparently referring to the Kremlin’s narrative about Ukrainians all being neo-Nazis.

“Well, basically, he’s fucking washed up, a brain-dead idiot,” he said.
Kovtun, complaining that Russian forces haven’t been ruthless enough in their assault on Ukraine, blasts Putin personally for Moscow’s retreat from Kyiv.
“A fucking rocket should fly into the Verkhovna Rada [Ukraine’s Parliament] in Kyiv. That’s it, fuck it. Why didn’t [a rocket] fucking fly? I don’t fucking get it, you’re fucked, Putin—motherfucker! Why didn’t a rocket fly into Kyiv, so they’d think… fuck, yes, for fuck’s sake there’s something wrong... something hasn’t been done the right way.”
Reporters with the news outlet say they contacted Kovtun directly to ask how he can call for the Russian bombing of Ukrainian cities when he himself was born in Ukraine and has relatives there.

“Even if [the bombs] don’t hit the target, fuck, let them be afraid,” a man identified as Kovtun can be heard responding in an audio clip of the call, before saying, “I don’t give a damn, I’ll alert the FSB about you and that’s it.”
When asked if that means he’s ready to cop to his words about Shoigu being “shit,” Kovtun suddenly seemed to have a change of heart, saying, “No, I’m not ready [to do that]. I don’t want to.”
Vlasov was also contacted by reporters about the recording, but he immediately hung up, according to audio released by the news outlet.
As of April 2022, Vlasov is said to have held a senior position in the artillery service of the 2nd Guards Motor Rifle Division of the 1st Guards Tank Army of the Western Military District of the Russian Federation. He was also reportedly transferred to the analytical department of the 1st Guards Tank Army, which had a command post deployed to the Belgorod region on the border with Ukraine.

The pair’s expletive-laced venting session has surfaced as Western intelligence reports more and more mutiny by Russian troops on the battlefield. The British Ministry of Defence, in its latest assessment, said Putin’s soldiers are likely going to be even less effective going into the fourth month of the war, due to the “the loss of a large proportion of the younger generation of professional officers.”
“More immediately, battalion tactical groups which are being reconstituted in Ukraine from survivors of multiple units are likely to be less effective due to a lack of junior leaders,” the ministry said, adding that the shortage of “experienced and credible platoon and company commanders is likely to result in a further decrease in morale and continued poor discipline.”
In line with that assessment, Ukraine’s Security Service on Tuesday released audio of what it said was a Russian soldier telling his wife about his unit’s recent rebellion against a Russian general.
After troops refused to follow orders to go to the frontline, he said, the general “started waving his gun and shooting,” threatening to fire at those who wouldn’t follow orders.

But another guy in the unit quickly whipped out a grenade and threatened the general right back, saying, “Come on, shoot me! We’ll blow up together!,” he said.
“The special forces guys also started pointing their guns at us. So, we pointed our guns at them. Basically, we almost shot each other, for fuck’s sake,” he said.",ba8f01fcf78b0e526e56e599b939c0e4ac535bf8,True,False,,,,,0,1654030140,,0,{},iapfvyn,False,t3_v1xxd4,False,True,t1_iap7ri0,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v1xxd4/top_russian_military_brass_caught_venting_youre/iapfvyn/,1654030158,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654001340.0,

&gt; The Russian-controlled Ukrainian region of Kherson has begun exporting grain that was harvested last year to Russia, the TASS news agency cited a senior local official as saying on Monday.

Ok you probably glazed over the important part, let me post it again:

&gt; the TASS news agency cited a senior local official as saying on Monday.

They are reporting on RUSSIAN MEDIA, not UKRAINIAN GRAIN.

If you take a moment you might recognize a pattern in this 4 PARAGRAPH ARTICLE.

&gt; ""We have space to store (the new crop) although we have a lot of grain here. People are now partially taking it out, having agreed with those who buy it from the Russian side,"" said Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Military-Civilian Administration.

Ok let's see...

&gt; said Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Military-Civilian Administration.

Ok yeah it's still about what Russia is claiming.

2 out of 4 so far, let's try number 3:

&gt; Stremousov was also cited as saying the administration was working on the supplies of sunflower seeds to local and Russian processing plants.

Damn, someone cited this bastard! Who would've been dumb enough to cite this Russian propaganda?  Maybe let's check the title to see:

&gt; TASS

Oh shit, this article is about Russian propaganda!

Maybe the fourth paragraph will be worse:

&gt; Ukraine has previously accused Russia of stealing its grain from the territories Moscow has occupied since launching what it calls a special military operation in February.

Oh no, they stated the counterpoint to the propaganda they are reporting on!  THOSE BASTARDS!

But they left out the correction, right?

&gt; The Russian-controlled Ukrainian region of Kherson has begun exporting grain that was harvested last year to Russia, the TASS news agency cited a senior local official as saying on Monday.

Ok you probably glazed over the important part, let me post it again:

&gt; the TASS news agency cited a senior local official as saying on Monday.

They are reporting on RUSSIAN MEDIA, not UKRAINIAN GRAIN.

If you take a moment you might recognize a pattern in this 4 PARAGRAPH ARTICLE.

&gt; ""We have space to store (the new crop) although we have a lot of grain here. People are now partially taking it out, having agreed with those who buy it from the Russian side,"" said Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Military-Civilian Administration.

Ok let's see...

&gt; said Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Military-Civilian Administration.

Ok yeah it's still about what Russia is claiming.

2 out of 4 so far, let's try number 3:

&gt; Stremousov was also cited as saying the administration was working on the supplies of sunflower seeds to local and Russian processing plants.

Damn, someone cited this bastard! Who would've been dumb enough to cite this Russian propaganda?  Maybe let's check the title to see:

&gt; TASS

Oh shit, this article is about Russian propaganda!

Maybe the fourth paragraph will be worse:

&gt; Ukraine has previously accused Russia of stealing its grain from the territories Moscow has occupied since launching what it calls a special military operation in February.

Oh no, they stated the counterpoint to the propaganda they are reporting!  THOSE BASTARDS!

But they left out the correction, right?

If you're flying uphill,  the software needs to show for a little slack to allow you room to ascend up the hill.

I think the bigger issue here is payload capacity.   Most of the smaller DJI type drones are too small to carrry a useful beyond the tiny camera they already have.   A bigger one like an m300 can carry a few pounds,  so a single grenade or mortar round would work.

Ukraines losses aren't that bad all things considered, especially when you consider they've mobilized to a state of total war, and they're being flooded with cutting edge western weaponry.

To contrast, Russia can't mobilize unless they declare war, which Putin seems unwilling to do, so their manpower is depleting all the time, their morale is horrible compared to the Ukrainians who are fighting for their very right to exist. And while Ukraine is getting flooded with modern weapons, Russia is rapidly depleting its stocks of equipment, which they often can't replace due to sanctions cutting off supplies of critical components, and even what they CAN replace with purely internal supply chains they can't replace at the rate they're losing it.

972,[],False,,zebsdee,,,[],,,,text,t2_9um0yw2,False,False,"&gt;The UK and EU have agreed a co-ordinated ban on insuring ships carrying Russian oil, shutting Moscow out of the vital Lloyd’s of London insurance market and sharply curbing its ability to export crude, according to British and European officials.  
Lloyd’s has been the heart of the marine insurance industry for centuries and blocking its members from insuring Russian oil cargoes will pile more pressure on global commodity markets, which have been in turmoil since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.  
The insurance ban is part of a new EU sanctions package targeting Russian oil exports. Brussels agreed an embargo on most Russia oil shipments late on Monday but the involvement of the UK unlocked the insurance ban. This could have much broader consequences for Moscow’s exports and leave it looking for insurance in smaller, less developed markets.  
Insurance has been a big sticking point in the development of the EU oil ban, with underwriters warning of the wider economic consequences of clamping down on a sector that is crucial to international trade.  
There was also concern in Brussels that the EU acting alone on insurance sanctions would mean that more business flowed to London’s international market. “There is a level playing field issue if London keeps on providing insurance and then a lot of it goes via Lloyd’s of London,” a senior commission official said.  
Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, announced action on shipping on Tuesday but officials said it was London’s decision to drop its opposition that cleared the way for the new sanctions package.  
Greece and Cyprus, which have significant shipping sectors, only agreed after a commitment from the UK to follow suit, officials said.  
The UK government refused to comment, but people briefed on the plans said an announcement was imminent on Britain banning insurers from covering ships carrying Russian oil. “This is something that is happening in a co-ordinated way,” said one.  
Helima Croft, head of commodities strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said: “It’s hard to underplay how significant a move this is by the UK and EU. Taking out insurance will have a huge impact on Russia’s ability to export its oil. It’s one of the toughest sanctions Europe has in its armoury.”  
The London insurance market has been bracing for sanctions to be extended to the key marine sector after moves to cut off aviation and space cover to Russian companies earlier this year.  
Senior figures in the Lloyd’s market have stressed to officials in Brussels and Westminster the challenge of establishing the provenance of oil cargoes on ships, according to people familiar with the matter.",cb21b093710dc874b60a22b8f670fda03d5062c8,True,False,,,,,0,1654028362,,0,{},iapbrj8,True,t3_v1z3bo,False,True,t3_v1z3bo,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v1z3bo/uk_and_eu_hit_russian_oil_cargoes_with_insurance/iapbrj8/,1654028376,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653999562.0,

I suspect OPEC wants to keep our nations addicted, but keep prices high for as long as possible. The situation in Russia has made the writing on the wall very clear for them as it has accelerated the process of moving away from fossil fuels in many (not all) Western nations. If Russia becomes an outsider in OPEC+, its status as a meaningful player as the West's appetite for fossil fuels trickles to a halt over the next thirty years becomes moot.

Russia is fucking itself more and more. When the West finishes its switch, Russia can continue to burn its cheap oil internally, and supplying less-developed nations, but it will find itself increasingly lagging technologically because the innovations developed along-side alternative energy sources will have passed it by, and sanctions will have prevented it from developing them.

They and their satellites will be stuck in the twenty-teens. Much of the rest of the world will be firmly in the twenty-fifties.

And how long until the climate change denialists are shouted down by incontrovertible proof? When coastal cities are permanently flooded by a catastrophic ice shelf collapse? When tropical systems begin hitting cities in the far northern and southern latitudes? When green areas bake dry and millions die in unimaginable heat waves? How long until unchecked carbon emissions are seen by the world community as a crime as severe as invading a bordering sovereign nation?

Russia and its satellites could see another thirty or forty years of sanctions until they ""clean up"" their collective act and keep their carbon in the group. What an interesting century this might be?

You mean English? :)

English (as a German language with Celtic and Roman/French dips) and Russian (Slavic with German, Roman and Turkic dips) just happen to come from different branches of Indo-European languages, and their basic structure differ a lot, even if we have a lot of similar word roots coming from Latin.

It's difficult to me to answer how hard it was learning English, because I've started to learn it whe I was 3, and now I'm about thirty. Nevertheless, I think the main thing in learning foreign languages is understanding their structure and basic set of rules. When you do, it's not that difficult anymore.

&gt;Personally, I am struggling with the lack of articles in your language. I guess that is what the conjugations are cases are supposed to represent?

Yep, you're pretty much correct, our languages just use different means to pass the same information.

What was also said, albeit less prominently, was that the training was about small unit resistance, guerilla warfare, hit and run tactics. None had mentioned anything about the joint warfare because, of course, Ukraine barely had any serious, sophisticated equipment or firepower other than the mostly Soviet stock they started the war with.

So, the incredible resistance that the Ukrainians are mounting in the east now is all them, not NATO training. But then, it's still mostly the thousand cuts tactics they used around Kyiv. Russian lines expose their flanks less than before, like the ancient phalanx formations, which means inflicting cuts, even with better quality but a smaller number of artillery, becomes more difficult.

Ukraine is extremely desperate for guns and missiles, which the west should have given yesterday unless they want Ukraine to fall, but even now the west is tiptoeing around the 'line' they set themselves. Russia might not even see the same line or care, as they already convinced themselves that this IS a war directly against NATO.

A lot of her ideas became co-opted by both Nazis and Hindu nationalists and she became heavily involved in neo-Nazi groups later on in Indian politics. A lot of it also has to do with the anti-British sentiment that a lot of Indians had before and after WWII (for good reason, obviously) and many people, especially Hindu nationalists, viewed Nazis in a more sympathetic light because they were opposed to the British Empire. In more recent times a think a lot of it just has to go with glossing over a lot of the really bad history of Nazism and focusing more on the “effectiveness” of Hitler’s political campaigns, etc. It’s a really weird mix of stuff.

*The Security Service of Ukraine reports on the exposure of Russian agents and collaborators on the territory of Ukraine.*  
  
*Source: Artem Dekhtiarenko, Head of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) Press Service*  
  
*Details: Since the beginning of the full-scale aggression by the Russian Federation, the Ukrainian special service has exposed more than 360 Russian agents and more than 5,000 collaborators.*  
  
*Among the last detainees was an employee of one of the defence enterprises in Kyiv, whom the SBU counter-intelligence service, with the assistance of the Ukroboronprom security unit, caught campaigning in favour of the Russian Federation.*  
  
*According to Dekhtiarenko, an employee of the Ukroboronprom conglomerate publicly justified the war crimes of the invaders and called on colleagues to support the enemy army. The official repeatedly asked the President of the Russian Federation to grant him Russian citizenship.*  
  
*During searches at the agitator's place of residence, law enforcement officers found electronic media with pro-Kremlin propaganda, as well as design documentation on aircraft construction.*  
  
*We have launched English Twitter! Follow us!*  
  
*Now the perpetrator has been informed of suspicion. Measures are underway in order to establish all the circumstances of his subversive activities.*  
  
*Also, according to the materials of the SBU, a Russian citizen who called on Kyiv residents to cooperate with the enemy was sentenced to 5 years in prison. The perpetrator lived in Kyiv using forged documents and coordinated his actions with one of the ideologists close to the Kremlin.*  
  
*During a special operation in the Donetsk region, the Russian agent network that scouted the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the Eastern Front was eliminated. One agent was detained in Sloviansk, the other in Kramatorsk district.*  
  
*In the Luhansk region, according to the SBU materials, two commanders of the so-called Luhansk People's Republic, who were captured near Sievierodonetsk, were sentenced to 8 and 10 years in prison.*  
  
*In Kharkiv, SBU officers exposed two former members of illegal armed groups of Certain Areas of Donetsk and Luhansk Regions (CADLR).*",94ba665bdcf4028cb1afe7544b56b982832d5333,True,False,,,,,0,1654027219,,0,{},iap92ko,True,t3_v1ymku,False,True,t3_v1ymku,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v1ymku/security_service_of_ukraine_found_an_agitator_for/iap92ko/,1654027237,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653998419.0,

It is possible that ""some countries"" will push for ceasefire after that (we know very well which countries), but it won't happen. Ironically, they're the countries that have basically no means how to push Ukraine into it, because they decided to limit their help from the very beginning. I mean, what if Germany or Hungary will try to create pressure on Ukraine? With what? They have nothing to threaten them with. The only possible case in which it may hurt is France, but that can be endured.

On the other hand, countries like the USA, UK, Poland, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, the Baltic states etc. decided long ago that they'll see this through, and they are the ones who are actually helping. They won't give up or stop helping. Especially Poland would rather start the next World War than to see Ukraine fall.

It will create inner tension in NATO and the EU. These countries will be branded as traitors, and may split both pacts in two. But if that happens, France and Germany would have to risk that the future of Europe would be concentrated around countries like Poland and the UK, and I'm sure they wouldn't want that.

# Probably somewhat-True:

Lavrov and a military contingent will go to turkey on June 8 to negotiate the stolen grain issue—Putin tentatively has agreed to cooperate with Erdogan [who announced yesterday would begin to “tightly control” the stolen grain issue].



Russia claims that it located a refrigerator-truck with the remains of fallen Azovstal defenders.  It claims that this truck has the remains of 152 bodies in it.  Russia claims to be in negotiations with Kyiv to return/exchange these remains.  


# Attempt to Spin defeat:

RF Council Speaker attempts to reassures the Russian public, saying that the “special [genocide] operation” is taking a long time bc the military must do planning and small battles in order to avoid harming the civilian population.  She soon after publicly asks Kyiv to return to the negotiating table.




# Delusions and Propaganda Lies:

Pushilin gleefully announces the commandeering of the commercial ships which have been trapped at Mariupol, pretending that he’s not a wicked thief, announces that the so called DPR will boast its own merchant fleet. [Ignorant claim, as Turkey does no longer permit any commercial vessel that docked in occupied territory to pass through, and who else can trade with? Romania, Greece?  Good luck with that.]


RF claims to have attacked the shipyards at Mykoliv, including a shipbuilding plant.  Claims, though not credibly, that Ukrainian military equipment was destroyed.
&gt; “As a result of an artillery strike on a hangar on the territory of the Okean shipbuilding plant in the city of Nikolaev, more than 15 Ukrainian tanks and infantry fighting vehicles and 5 large-caliber artillery pieces were destroyed.”

Gave absolutely ridiculous numbers, read for a big eye roll:

&gt; 62 control points of the Ukrainian army, including the operational command ""South"" in the area of Novy Bug in the Nikolaev region, were hit by Russian missile forces and artillery.  593 areas concentrated manpower and military equipment of the armed forces of Ukraine were hit, 55 artillery batteries in were hit by rocket and artillery strikes.

When 45% of the population has evacuated then that makes it easy to believe that there is at least a resignation towards Russian rule in the remaining population. 

We know there are angry partisans still there. 

We also know that the Russians have kidnapped thousands of pro-Kyev residents from the city and sent them to Siberia. The fact that many of them were sold out by neighbour's makes it hard to believe that none of the people in Kherson are willing to support Russia.

There was a huge effort during the Soviet era to displace Ukrainians with Russians. There was a strange situation that persisted and worsened where Ukrainians faced discrimination within Ukraine. This war is part of the aftermath.  Guess what happens to a population that was discriminated and treated like second class citizens in Ukraine by Russian carpet baggers, after Ukraine became independent.  

Russians in Ukraine have seen a reversal. They have been forced to change their attitudes or suffer, and many were proud Vodka pickled idiots that refused, angry at their loss of privileged status and ability to deride and bully Ukrainians.  They created a toxic situation that made all Russians look bad so that Russians have been persecuted, too often unfairly.  This has lead to a strange situation. If I steal your land, is it my land now? Easy to say no. If the land was stolen over a long period of time, starting over 100 years ago, is it fair to take the land back or is it my land now.

If they go close to wavetop height rather than a couple hundred or a couple thousand feet high over the ocean, they're sea skimming. Ballistic missiles mostly follow a ballistic trajectory, launching fast like a space rocket upwards and gaining speed upwards and a little sideways. They go so fast and high that they can cover huge distances across the ground fast. A cruise missile might avoid detection by being so low, radar and AAA can't easily target it. A ballistic missile wants to do all its speeding up basically right above the launcher and travel at 50,000' above the ground or much higher. They aren't sneaky, they're just really fast. They close in on their targets like a meteor. Tactical ballistic missiles might have a few hundred pounds of explosive or other conventional warheads, but there are longer ranged missiles more typically associated with chemical or nuclear weapons. They're such expensive weapons that blowing up one building is rarely worth the cost.

There are other types of missile, like the direct attack missile that just goes towards a target fast - many antitank missiles are this variety.",1db0a8307e0a8bab11171b85a1144852b1549566,True,False,,,,,0,1654022833,,0,{},iap0dn1,False,t3_v1w7va,False,True,t1_iaoydan,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v1w7va/russian_troops_have_captured_approximately_half/iap0dn1/,1654022853,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653994033.0,

Like you do realize that’s more than likely just propaganda right? If they had 700,000 troops, they would have freed Mariopol, taken back Kherson and would have stopped the Russians from ever getting as far as they did in the Donbass region.

What part of “Most of them are still in training” was too complicated for you?

&gt;	They may place more sanctions or demand Russia pay for the clean up but no, there is not a chance on hell they’re going to start WW3 over Ukraine.

Nukes aren’t happening anyways. It’s a fantasy. Sure, Russia might say “All then occupied territories are Russia and we will use nukes if you invade”. Russia also said it would be war if the US shared live intel with Ukraine. It turns out the US has been giving grid coordinates of Russiam equipment. Russias response: *crickets* Russia said it would be war if the US sent more equipment to Russia. The US sent howitzers, and APCs, and helicopters. Russias response: *crickets* Russia has said lots of things that turn out not to be true.

There is 95% chance this remains a conventional war, just like the US in Vietnam (with Vietnam being supplied by Russia) or Soviets in Afghanistan (with Mujahadeen being supplied by the US). “Superpowers” lose wars all the time. I highly suggest you watch Perun’s video [Calling Russias Nuclear Bluff](https://youtu.be/sxOO0hCCSk4) to understand when Russia says they will use nuclear weapon. Losing territory they just occupied months ago is not “an existential risk to Russia”.

Again, the course of this war will remain conventional. Every day the balance of forces shifts towards Ukraine, as sanctions limits Russias ability to wage modern war. Already, we’ve seen Russia essentially stop using Kalibr missiles since they don’t have the capability to produce new ones. Russian pilots are forced to fly low level bombing missions due to lack of PGMs, exposing them to MANPADS fire. Downed pilots are getting older and older as Russia is unable to effectively train new pilots. Fighting equipment that Russia is deploying gets older and older. Russia is extending the military age limit to 65, a sure sign they are running short of men. Nazi Germany didn’t accept 60 year olds until October 1944, 6 months before the end of the war.

On the Ukrainian side, they have enough personnel to realistically make a 1 to 1.5m personnel Army by the end of the year. There is enough US money just in the current $20bn authorization to outfit a dozen Brigades with modern-ish US equipment. We’re talking M1A1/M1A2 Abrams, M2A2 Bradley, Paladin, MLRS, etc. Not top of the line, but late 80s / early 90s vintage that will work great against 1960s vintage Russian tanks.",3ec0de36a8e36e9882d8b437e6aa10e70d7a8bda,True,False,,,,,0,1654022436,,0,{},iaozfsj,False,t3_v1rs2m,False,True,t1_iaovc54,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v1rs2m/putins_hard_choices_why_the_russian_despot_can/iaozfsj/,1654022451,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653993636.0,

The ukrainian attack, unless very well equiped with things such as MLRS, which they currently seem to lack, is unlikely to happen in the Donbas area.

Or **""Pro-Russian Kherson grain farmers resume exports to Russia - TASS""** which more closely tracks the official's quote that there exist famers who ""agree with those who buy it from the Russian side"" but offers no indication that these farmers speak for any sizable group of Kherson residents.

Or even, if they believe the news is that _TASS itself_ is making a statement that this is evidence that Kherson as a region is pro-Russian, they could have said **""Kherson region is pro-Russian, begins grain exports to Russia - TASS""** - and while this is a hard title to parse, it makes it clear that part of the thing they are reporting on is a statement by TASS that Kherson is pro-Russian.

---

But when they uncritically use the phrase **""Pro-Russian Kherson region""**, that's an editorial choice that strongly implies that there are two underlying facts here: (1) that Kherson is pro-Russian, and (2) that TASS is reporting on grain exports to Russia.

An editorial team still committed to neutrality per https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters#Policy_of_objective_language should have processes in place to resolve these ambiguities in headlines. These processes clearly failed.

&gt; KYIV, May 31 - Ukrainian forces were holding out in the eastern industrial city of Sievierodonetsk on Tuesday, resisting Russia&amp;#039;s all-out assault to capture a bombed-out wasteland that Moscow has made the principal objective of its invasion.

&gt; Russia, responding to Western sanctions after its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, widened its gas cuts to Europe on Tuesday with Gazprom saying it would cut supplies to several &amp;quot;Unfriendly&amp;quot; countries which have refused to accept Moscow&amp;#039;s roubles-for-gas payment scheme.

&gt; Ukraine says Russia has destroyed all of the city&amp;#039;s critical infrastructure with unrelenting bombardment, followed by wave after wave of mass ground assaults involving huge numbers of casualties.

The stupidity is all yours because you are unable to comprehend much less accept that you have been fed a pack of lies throughout your life.

I know more than you because all you know is false revisionist history invented by asswipes like Dugin and Patrushev who engage in rewriting of history to fit their fascist agendas.

&gt;you don’t know anything about their common history

You mean the Holodomor, Stalin's brutal and barbaric starvation of millions of kulak farmers?

&gt;you don’t know that the west and east of Ukraine are essentially 2 different worlds,

You mean because ethnic Russians were moved in to replace the kulaks that Stalin had starved to death  in classic Russian policy of colonization of territories?

&gt;but you make a lot of statements without any facts other than propaganda,

My facts are facts, your facts are just a pack of lies.

&gt;this is stupid, very, very stupid.

Yes, spreading lies is incredibly stupid and shortsighted. You need professional therapy and so do most of your compatriots.

Not in a million years will any of those countries fire a single bullet directly at Russia because that is paramount to WW3.

It's still a tank which can keep order against thousands of people and would be much more effective as a moving bunker for defence.

The result of this is that it feels like we might be at the end of the line for the idea of 'just make the armor thicker/stronger/etc' to compensate, because it just doesn't seem like the kind of 'arms race' that the tank is going to win. It's just too much easier to make missiles with a more powerful payload than it is to pile more armor onto tanks. They're already too big and bulky. 

I think there's two directions future tanks are going to go in. Active defenses that can prematurely detonate incoming missiles will become more and more important, and if that happens then I think tanks will evolve to get lighter and faster, as that increased mobility will be more useful than heavier armor. 

There still will be plenty of room on the battlefield for the mobile firepower that a tank provides, and it'll still want to be plenty strong to withstand rifle and machine-gun fire.

Ukraine has about 300,000 and even if they boost that that 350,000, it still won't be enough. It's pretty much the same mistake Russia is making with out the heavy gear.

It really doesn't when it means starting a war against a nuclear power. You think America gives Ukraine all the heavy gear they could ever want (which isn't going to happen or at least enough for a large scale invasion), they invade and then what? Russia can very easily justify using nukes at that point and can convince others (specifically China) that it was self defence as it was Ukraine invading them. Then all that gear is gone and free promotion is gone. That is even if they give them the amount of gear they would need for such an invasion which again, they most certainly will not. At least not for free.

A T-62 is considered heavy gear dude. It's a literal tank and although one which would be cut in half by any modern tank, still good enough to subdue large chunks of the population with a single crew.

It also doesn't mean Ukraine will be able to take it. Offence needs more man and more fire power than defense. Ukraine has the former but not the ladder. 

They actually have factories which can produce more heavy gear. Not enough to go back their invasion levels but enough to ward off any attacks.

2185,[],False,,AMythicEcho,,,[],,,,text,t2_dfr6h9p6,False,False,"Heavy and expensive are relative things. This seems to come from the same combat-philosophical place that argued ground warfare was dead because of aircraft, or the army wasn't relevant because of nuclear weapons... etc. Guess what, every thing dies in war, and it will always come down to flexibility and economics. 

Tanks aren't good for everything, very little is. MBT's while pricier than small drones or shoulder launched weapons aren't as pricy as the aircraft and greater quantity of longer range guided munitions you'd potentially need to rely on in the absence of armor. Do you want 80+ $1.5M machine shooting relatively cheap rounds, or one F-35 and a limited number of relatively pricey missiles; the F-35 can't be everywhere. If there is some commentary on tanks, its that they need to continue to evolve. 

Tank design in the second half of the 20th century was dominated by the idea of relatively self contained formations of tanks engaging other formations of tanks. In hindsight I think this was a relatively short sighted direction to take tanks. The out come is that many Tanks are relatively specialized and unoptimized for a battlefield dominated by flexible infantry.

The relevancy of tanks is only questioned because Russia's tanks in Ukraine have been countered by a high volume of drones and shoulder launched weapons, but I think it can't be overlooked that this relatively high volume is only possible because of the number of nations supplying these. If for instance the US were the only nation supplying these kinds of systems, at the rate Ukraine is using them the US stockpile would be depleted before the end of the year let alone before the end of the conflict.  How many nations have the manufacturing capacity to produce enough of these systems in sufficient quantities? -Even the US is going to take 2 years to spin up meaningful production capacity. And once you hypothetically reach the point where these kinds of munitions are depleted the last side with tanks, even if they're really dated, is going to have a clear advantage over the other. 

At the same time several companies have systems in varying degrees of development and maturity to actively counter shoulder launcher missiles and drones, so its only a matter of time and only leaves the question of how these technology will be integrated into armored units. 

We're also seeing a growing number of tank launched drone systems, designed to facilitate battlefield awareness and longer range engagement with infantry units that might be hidden laying in wait with these kinds of anti-tank weapons.

And just as we saw a greater deployment of anti-IED, jamming technology, it seems inevitable that tanks would begin to have enough electronic warfare to jam radio controls of drones.

I think the 20th century notion of a main battle tank may well be on its way out. But I think we'll see a new type of tank that is designed to operate more independently from other tanks, but more dedicatedly filling the niche that many of the up-armed armored troop transports attempt to fill. Tanks that rely more on active defenses than armor. Something more of a medium tank that brings many of the technologies that might over load the more mobile light armored units but would be beneficial to the survival of these less armored units. Simply put there will always be a need for progressive degrees of survivability and capability, and some capabilities are only justified when the vehicle you can put them in has some heightened degree of survivability.",048cff05aafd1575045877242ccc69cefc5ac474,True,False,,,,,0,1654015560,,0,{},iaoj155,False,t3_v1q4e3,False,False,t3_v1q4e3,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v1q4e3/war_will_never_be_this_bulky_again_russias/iaoj155/,1654015575,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653986760.0,

The issue is, there is no infrastructure in place to deliver such vast amounts of oil and gas to those countries. The pipeline towards both India and China can only transport very small part of the volume which currently goes to Europe and is fed from different wells. 

Shipping LNG is difficult due to lack of terminals and oil shipping capacity sucks right now due to shippers refusing contracts due to lack of insurance coverage and again, fear of sanctions.

To overcome this, Russia is having a fire sale right now with heavily discounted oil and natural gas, cause if they are forced to close the wells, they will not be able to reopen them so soon. Plus, Europe was the market where profit was made, while exports to China and India were below cost or at best at break even even before.

This being the situation, there is a great possibility that Finland and Sweden will cancel their Nato applications and try to negotiate some kind of decent relations with Putin's Russia. It is also highly likely that they will also withdraw from being close non-member allies to Nato. 

This all is sad but for Finland and Sweden this is a game of survival.

But nominal 'support' is not the same thing as _enthusiasm_, which the Russians lack. Few people are voluntarily putting 'Z' stickers on their cars and so on. There have not been any non-staged pro-war demonstrations, and on the contrary Putin's people had to force government workers to go to fill the seats at his big rally at the start of the war. This is the flip side of the learned apathy - Russians don't volunteer for anything. 

But there's a reason Putin hasn't and likely won't mobilize, or declare war - he has little ability to actually get Russians to sacrifice much over this war. If there is such real support for the war, why is the Kremlin having such difficulty recruiting new contract-soldiers to actually fight it? They've had an advertising blitz, head-hunting, even forced government employees in the reserve to go to recruitment offices to receive hard-sell talks of re-enlisting. They've started offering shorter, one-year contracts. They've raised age limits for their contract-soldiers. By every indication this voiced support does not translate into real-world enthusiasm. Which again, should surprise no one who knows Russia well.

So far the average Russian has not been asked to sacrifice much. The financial sanctions were expected and don't affect the average Russian much (yet, anyway) and the trade sanctions will still take months to reach effect as stockpiles of imported goods start to run out and supply chains are disrupted. All the average Russian has seen so far is that IKEA and McDonalds are closed, which _isn't_ such a big deal. 

But when they start getting laid off because of halted production lines, or can't travel because Aeroflot's running out of parts for their fleet of Boeing and Airbus jets, or they threaten to raise taxes or cut pensions because of the costs of war and sanctions, then attitudes can change quickly. As they also would if they start to mobilize or send conscripts. 

In short, you shouldn't expect much from the Russians until they start to see deeper effects on their personal lives. But that has barely begun to happen yet, and every economic expert has said since the start it will take longer for the full effects of sanctions to be felt. (Including the Russian Central Bank itself)

The West does not need to rethink its strategy as this article claims. Nobody serious imagined Putin would be overthrown just because McDonalds closed down.",fdb4f47348e003b92a117a38f02413f0798da2c2,True,False,,,,,0,1654014043,,0,{},iaoffhf,False,t3_v1rx7j,False,True,t3_v1rx7j,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v1rx7j/influenced_by_kremlin_propaganda_the_russian/iaoffhf/,1654014054,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653985243.0,

No part of that ""stretches understanding"". It's a non-objective statement, openly defying their ""policy"". It uses a maximally-subjective  inference without backing data instead of speaking the direct truth, ""Russian-occupied Kherson"".

Of course, Russia has decided, in the latest evolution of warfare, that it will immediately declare victory anywhere a Russian foot steps, deport half of everybody, move everyone to the ruble zone, issue Russian passports... do **everything** to pretend like all the territory they've touched has *already* been ceded, since they dont give half a rat's ass about negotiation... If I physically stand here, it's already Russia! That makes ""objective"" reporting a bit dicier, which of course is Russia's intention here, it wants to make it harder to ""give back"" territory later. They are poisoning all of the wells they can find.

... but Reuters skipped **all** the steps for that debacle anyway. They went straight to ""pro-Russian"", which is clearly subjective.

Note the authors, they should be credited for every wire article. Find the ones who consistently do this. We have to identify the hostiles (might be the whole org, but it's probably best to start by focusing on individual offenders), then figure out an effective strategy to either remove their bias or destroy their organization's capacity to conduct effective passive assaults on Ukrainian sovereignty.

Russia is constantly imposing itself on all the former Soviet republics because it feels that it has the right to do so, and it is ready to kill those who disagree with it. This makes all the peoples living in the region very unhappy because they cannot develop the way they want to. It also makes them resist Russia even more.

Also, no. The Army never saw the Stryker MGS as the ‘future of tanks’. It was an attempt to give motorised units an Anti-Armour ability without having to rely on tanks, Bradley’s etc. 

Also, the Stryker MGS was a massive failure. The problem with a lightly armoured gun system is, it’s too vulnerable, whereas a tank isn’t. 

Yes Tanks are vulnerable to Javelins, Drones etc. but an AFV is vulnerable to them, plus RPG’s, Recoilless rifles, mortars, specialised grenade rounds, AT rifles, 50cal AMR rounds, shaped charge mines, 30mm+ rounds etc. You get the point. 

Plus the MGS was only armed with a 105mm cannon. So it wouldn’t be able to penetrate the armour of a T-72B3.

You put those on the battlefield, and Russia will get experience countering them and share that experience with China and anyone else. Second, if you dump too many advanced weapons on the battlefield all at once, Russia will develop strategies and countermeasures for the advanced weapons rather quickly. Those same defenses are going to be effective to less advanced weapons as well, making all of the weapons on the battlefield less effective.

It isn't that unique to Germany, large parts of Europe are/have been heavily reliant on Russian energy. But the situation is probably worse in Germany for a variety of reasons, gas pipelines from Siberia extend back to the 70s/80s, the energy infrastructure for large parts of eastern Germany was built when it was part of the soviet union. Then there's the extreme aversion and rapid phase-out of nuclear. And again, a very strong belief in interdependence as a means of preserving peace. Some other former soviet states are just as dependent on Russian energy, whereas others were smart enough to see the writing on the wall and diversify. But generally, it's a fairly complex subject.

But you say I don't understand.  Okay, go ahead and explain to me what I don't understand, but since you're claiming that I am not understanding what you've written, you may not repeat anything I've comprehended and refuted, meaning you cannot say anything similar to the following:

&gt;\[T\]he Russians vulnerability can be exploited by forcing the Russians to wage war as they say they do, not as we know they do. So when they don't follow rules that we can all agree on, including the Russians, they are swiftly punished. The punishment is a long range rocket that will destroy something they

or

&gt;It is very simple. All Biden has to say publicy loud and clear is that Ukraine at the moment is not getting the long range rockets. However, the US will monitor Russia's behaviour closely and will from now on review the decision whenever Russia uses methods such as;  
  
terror,  
  
forced transfer of people,  
  
attempts to eradicate Ukrainian language, culture or history,  
  
mistreatment of civilians such as kidnapping, rape, torture and murder,  
  
mistreatment or murder of PoW.  
  
By terror the US include the Russian armed forces' current use of;  
  
indiscriminate shelling of civilian areas and infrastructure,  
  
missiles targeting civilian areas and infrastructure in cities far away from any of the fronts.  
  
This should place a spotlight on the Russian troops' behaviour, and ideally have a restraining effect on them. If it does restrain Russia's behaviour it shows their acceptance of a junior position in relation to US. If the behaviour is not changed US is free to supply long range rockets and everyone will think Russia have only themselves to blame, exonerating US and Ukraine from the outcome of the use of long range rockets, as long as no civilians are targeted.

You're confusing cause (the Liberum veto) with effect (decline &amp; collapse of the commonwealth). If you want to disagree with the scholarly consensus, then you need to provide more evidence explaining why the Liberum veto didn't make the commonwealth vulnerable to foreign meddling and bribery.

 &gt; [The Liberum veto] was used extensively, often paralyzing the government, making a centralization of power (opposed by nobles jealous of their independence) impossible, and leaving Poland vulnerable to the influence of foreign powers, which habitually bribed delegates to the Sejm to force the adjournment of sessions that threatened to pass legislation contrary to their interests.

Harvard political scientist Grzegorz Ekiert, assessing the
history of the liberum veto in Poland, [concludes](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C26&amp;q=Grzegorz+Ekiert%2C+%22Veto%2C+Liberum%22%2C+in+Seymour+Martin+Lipset%2C+ed.+%E2%80%98%27The+Encyclopedia+of+Democracy%27%E2%80%99+%281998%29+4%3A1341&amp;btnG=)

&gt; The principle of the liberum veto preserved the feudal features of Poland's political system, weakened the role of the monarchy, led to anarchy in political life, and contributed to the economic and political decline of the Polish state. Such a situation made the country vulnerable to foreign invasions and ultimately led to its collapse.

And [again](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberum_veto):

&gt; historians hold that the principle of liberum veto was a major cause of the deterioration of the Commonwealth political system and Commonwealth's eventual downfall. Deputies bribed by magnates or foreign powers, or simply content to believe they were living in some kind of ""Golden Age"", for over a century paralysed the Commonwealth's government, stemming any attempts at reform. Piotr Stefan Wandycz wrote that the ""liberum veto had become the sinister symbol of old Polish anarchy."" Wagner echoed him thus: ""Certainly, there was no other institution of old Poland which has been more sharply criticized in more recent times than this one.""",d2dcb6e5c49b52f3cc7d9c8d227859411cdfe5a7,True,False,,,,,0,1654007420,,0,{},iao04y1,False,t3_v1bmzj,False,True,t1_iamw2ii,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v1bmzj/breaking_news_the_european_union_to_ban_90_oil/iao04y1/,1654007440,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653978620.0,

*Ukrainian defenders destroyed a large unit of the Wagner Group \[a network of mercenaries who serve as the de facto private army of Russian President Vladimir Putin\] in Donbas.*  
  
*Source: Security Service of Ukraine; Ukrainska Pravda’s interlocutor with law enforcement agencies*  
  
*Details: A new telephone conversation between the invaders which was intercepted by the Security Service of Ukraine \[SSU\] showed that after the elimination of such an elite unit of Russian soldiers (according to a source, the Wagner group fighters were killed on 27 May), ordinary Russian occupiers are hesitating whether to fight.*  
  
*Quote from the occupier: ""So many ChVK Wagner \[ChVK is the Russian abbreviation for Private Military Company\] fighters were deployed there, where the border needs to be taken… But these ChVKs are of no use there! They all died there, these ChVKs. These are f\*\*king special forces! Prepared, holy sh\*t! They all died. Well, not all of them, there were some left. F\*\*k if I know, I don’t see any other way out of this situation at all.""*  
  
*Details: According to the intercepted call, the wife gives the occupier the right advice - ""F\*\*k them all, with their army.""*  
  
*Previously: The Security Service of Ukraine has intercepted telephone conversations between Russian commanders in which they complain about their subordinates refusing to go on the offensive.*",a0216ef6e213cb92dafbab6f336e21030e0aec93,True,False,,,,,0,1654006290,,0,{},ianxork,True,t3_v1r4tg,False,True,t3_v1r4tg,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v1r4tg/security_service_of_ukraine_ukrainian_soldiers/ianxork/,1654006307,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653977490.0,

For example there was a missile strike on an airbase in Russia during the first weeks of the war. That strike alone was so effective it is one of the main reasons that the US is not going to provide ATACS munitions for their HIMARS rocket artillery. Since those aircraft are not dotting the Ukrainian countryside, they don't count I suppose.

The Ukrainians numbers are credible.

 The actual depletion of Russian airpower is likely higher. Before the war, the Russians still had spare parts on order from Ukraine. It is suspected that Russia is suffering crippling issues with maintenance and repairs. 

The numbers Ukraine provides are repeatedly questioned both with genuine suspicion and as propaganda attempts to discredit them. It is obvious on analysis that they well proven by professionals who know their jobs, and are 100% conservative meaning in some cases they are very low.

The 30k dead Russian soldiers is the prime example. Russians that die behind Russian lines due to artillery strikes are not counted. Add several thousand of these. Russians were wounded and evacuated to later die behind Russian lines are not counted. Wounded who will not be able to fight with acquired permanent disabilities are a extremely large number and are of course not counted among the dead.

Dead and wounded Russians likely total over 100k. This is corroborated by the proportions of Units either completely destroyed like the VDV that tried to capture Kyev Airport, or the Russian units that have 50%+ casualties and are being kept on the front line because they are currently too strong to be replaced. 

There have been repeated questions of why Ukraine holds on where it seems better to retreat to armchair generals. The Russians are politically guided into military blunders so that their attacks are self destructive.  Why would Ukraine retreat from Russian soldiers throwing themselves into a meat grinder?

There are actually mercy rules being called in the Russians favour. Russia will need aircraft and military to stabilize itself after regime change.

When I say ""lost"" I mean *strategically*, not tactically.  If war is politics by other means, then tactical victories are irrelevant to the big picture *unless* they can actually push a strategic victory.

So, strategically, what did Russia want out of this?

1) Discourage NATO expansion. *Looks at Sweden and Finland -* Well, I think we can call that a failure.  This war of Putins has healed the rifts in NATO left by the Trump presidency in ways that should have taken decades.  This goal cannot be acheived by Russia.

2) Demonstrate to the world that the Russian military was powerful and not to be underestimated.

Instead, they became a meme.  The *VDV* became a *meme.*  A laughingstock, rightly or wrongly.  Far from demonstrating Russian ability as a Superpower, Russia proved that it's not even a *major* power as far as force projection goes.  (This may not be accurate - but the truth matters less in foreign policy than *perception,* and this is the perception). This goal is also failed.

3) Unify Russian peoples into a superstate, bring Ukraine and, possibly, Belarus into the Russian Federation.

This goal has been walked back several times, because Ukrainian resistance has been as much *more* effective than expected as Russia's offense has been *in*effective, but we know this was an initial goal.

If Russia defeats Ukraines conventional military and conquers the country, what will they have? An insurgency that will never end, a population that hates them.  Worse, there are cracks appearing in the Russian Federation as some of their citizens shuck the programming and propaganda to burn down recruiting centers or post guerilla protests.

Even in the case of military victory, Russia has failed here as well. They have neither the manpower nor the unity to occupy Ukraine.  I don't think they have the power to win militarily either, but I'm less certain there - but in a long enough timeline, that doesn't matter.  Russia cannot hold Ukraine, and the longer they try the more they bleed.

This might be cold comfort for you, because militarily Ukraine suffers. You're bearing the brunt of this. I wish it weren't that way - if we knew the nukes didn't work, NATO would have already stepped in. Unfortunately, we *don't* know that, so we need to walk on cats feet and let you win the war for yourselves - with as much ammo and intel as you can be given, and enough volunteers to round out your forces without straining your supplies.

I wish I could say with certainty that Russia will lose tactically *as well as* strategically and politically. I can't, at least not with any quick timeline. I *hope* they are, but I don't know.

Good luck.

&gt; Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comMay 31 - The role of the dollar and the euro as global currencies is set to decline as central banks rethink their strategies after the West froze Russian reserves, Russia&amp;#039;s central bank said on Tuesday, suggesting it could consider imposing negative rates for dollar and euro deposits.

&gt; To speed up the decline in foreign currencies&amp;#039; share in the Russian banking sector, Russia could consider imposing negative interest rates on banks&amp;#039; deposits in dollar and euros, the central bank said.

&gt; The central bank also said in the report that Russian private investors have become the main steering power on the stock market amid restrictions for non-residents to trade on Russian markets.

&gt; Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has denounced killings of civilians as &amp;quot;Genocide&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;War crimes,&amp;quot; while U.S. President Joe Biden has called Russian President Vladimir Putin &amp;quot;a war criminal&amp;quot; who should be brought to trial.

&gt; The joint investigation team, made up of Ukraine, Lithuania and Poland, that is meeting Tuesday in The Hague was established in late March, a few weeks after the ICC opened an investigation in Ukraine, after dozens of the court&amp;#039;s member states threw their weight behind an inquiry.

&gt; On Tuesday, a court in Ukraine convicted two Russian soldiers of war crimes for the shelling of civilian buildings and sentenced both to 11 1/2 years in prison.

- [Estimates project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Russia) their population to drop by 1/7 this century.
- Smaller population means a smaller labour force (declining GDP) and smaller military (they're already recruiting Gen X'ers for their war in Ukraine).
- Their quality of life is lower than in most of Europe, with high rates of alcoholism, drug abuse, drug-resistant tuberculosis, HIV, etc.

And that was even before you add excessive death rate du to Covid, now due to the war in Ukraine, more sanctions, and an even more fucked economy leading to more instability, and likely another baby bust.

My argument is that it would be morally better for the international community to not be conditional in their support, and your counter argument is that if the west would support Ukraine adequately in their struggle for survival, that would lead to the west dropping support for Ukraine.

So yes, the west is less committed than Ukraine, that's evident and logical. And that's a shame for Ukraine. For Ukraine one could only hope the west had the balls to support whatever action Ukraine deemed appropriate, but alas.",006997d46df89f625c864d77d1c4b65cc47b8cf3,True,False,,,,,0,1654001708,,0,{},ianoije,False,t3_v1jobg,False,True,t1_ianm4lj,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v1jobg/ukrainian_presidential_office_russians_hysterical/ianoije/,1654001720,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653972908.0,

It started out as a sub to discuss the Ukrainian conflict, causes and origins. It has now become simply ""slava Ukraina""&gt; That's the level of nearly every discussion.

""why did Russia invade Ukraine"" is not ""because they are madman"". Even the guy with the trumpet on his head who thinks he is Napoleon, has a reason why. It might be a stupid and unjustified reason, but he has his reason. And it explains why Russia is focussing so much on the Donbass right now.

But bring any level of nuance to the discussion and ""yuO arRE a krEmlIN shill"", while half of the morons here couldn't even give 5 background elements to the conflict.

&gt;You're repeating Kremlin propaganda and talking about instability as if it happened internally due to policy and not externally because of Putin and his bombs and killers

The position of the russian speaking minorities is directly related to the conflict. I hope you have 5 braincells to understand that this does not mean that Russia is justified to invade Ukraine, that there is a difference between ""cause"" and ""justification""

Also, it's not a Kremlin line, the treatment of russian speaking minorities has been raised by both the EU as well as NGOs.

And in the end, whatever you think of it, doesn't change my basic predictionj: keep ignoring the rights of your minorities (Palestinians, Basque, Hutu, Catalans, Catholic Irish,...) and enjoy decades of instability.

Artillerymen showing up to learn the system will have the basics in a day. They systems are stupid easy and designed to be run by someone with a 6th grade education. Literally. 

For all these supposed officers points of how tough it is, you should know that the requirements for canon crewmen are intellectually the lowest standards the military has. Down there cooks and truck drivers.

Now to clear up these ossifers misconceptions…

AIT or advanced individual training for field artillery is 10 weeks….. most of which is learning SHARP and other things that have nothing to do with field artillery. In training you would spend about 2 weeks in gunnery school.

So even a crash course would take 4 weeks and that’s pushing it… they trained up the guys on the triple 7s in about a week, so we don’t even need to really address this, we all already know it’s  just wrong.

This is assuming they already are in the army and trained on the basics.. this is correct. The guys they send should, and will, be actual artillerymen. Which is why their gonna grasp this shit in about an hour, and spend the rest of the time learning the intricacies and maintenance stuff specific to the unit. That’s gonna take more time than learning the actual weapon systems.

Also this is just for the MLRS system, different training for the officers and the fire direction center troops…. Sort of true. Artillery officers carry the same MOS code as FDC. They are NOT trained the same and your average artillery officer could never do the job of FDC without help.

Field artillery is very complex and professionals make it look easy….The US Army says that the dumbest talking walking rocks they can find, the ones that need asvab waivers and shot like that get enlisted as canon crewmen. The rest of us call the, DAGBYS, for DumAssGunBunnY. How that for a testament to how smart these guys are?

It’s not point and click…Actually, these days, it mostly is.

How long we’ll that depends if the sneaky Americas have already been training Ukrainian soldiers,  which I think we have… probably correct.

* They use standard protocols and frequencies, with no ECCM. Makes it trivial for any ECM station to jam them.

* They have multiple well known vulnerabilities that more sophisticated enemy ECM can take advantage of. For example, many drones, DJM ones included, can be forced to land by spoofing GPS and making them think that they are in a no fly zone (airports, mil bases, etc). Other vulnerabilities are denial-of-service attacks - you can craft invalid commands that cause those drones to reboot, making the drone unresponsive briefly and resulting in a crash if you spam that enough. Certain drones can be insta-bricked or even fully hijacked by a sophisticated enough attacker, and there are indications that Russia implemented this in some of their ECM equipment.

* A lot of commercial drones, DJM ones included, leak information via control channel, intentionally or not. Enemy ELINT can use that to detect drones and, in some cases, even drone operators. DJM drones in particular transmit ""electronic nameplates"" that reveal drone model, current coordinates, and even coordinates of the *drone launch site*. It's like a ""shell me please"" note strapped to your back - one that enemy ELINT can pick up on.

This is why commercial drones are useful but iffy if you use them unmodified. Russia doesn't have the ECM and ELINT to cover the entire front line - but they cover some places. Which can make those drones useless or dangerous to use.",d7b9475e3160466a1fbeea5e40f7109c3a9f1122,True,False,,,,,0,1653997482,,0,{},ianhd91,False,t3_v1i0kv,False,True,t1_ian2cp0,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v1i0kv/us_rq20_puma_drones_arrived_to_ukraine_marking/ianhd91/,1653997494,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653968682.0,

Earthquakes will still happen long after closing the gasfields anyways. So making them earthquake proof seems necessary in my opinion. But like I said in the post before. Groningen needs to decide what they want with a referendum and the parliament needs to listen because some of the decisions they made were humiliating. Like standing in a large line for a small compensation in the cold and not even having a chance to get the money if they didn't join the line really early in the morning. If they decide they don't want to open up the gas again it is fine as well. Then we have to look at other solutions. The solution we had before was buying more from Russia and closing Groningen. Buying more LNG is what we for sure will be doing but it will come at a high price and poverty for the people that can't afford it.,a0954561535da1c10a4a04bcd581d85eb4176b8d,True,False,,,,,0,1653997176,,0,{},iangwd4,False,t3_v17hr1,False,True,t1_iand6a8,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v17hr1/dutch_and_danish_set_to_be_cut_off_by_russia_over/iangwd4/,1653997188,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653968376.0,

If the US intelligence community wants to call, they have my number.  If they don't, I'll go on doing what I do now, working in a hospital laboratory (in the US).

Keep in mind how disconnected the average Russian is from the ""Real World"", they would lap up the Kremlin's explanation of how their hardships and lost loved ones are Ukraine's fault.

 A Ukranian nuclear strike on Russia would allow Putin to deploy his entire tactical stockpile against Ukraine without any serious repercussions. Even a modern 150 kt nuclear weapon detonating over a large metropolitan area like Moscow will cause 350,000 casualties at max. With 3 such strikes, we're looking at a million deaths, less then a percent of Russia's inhabitants. I think he'd be crazy enough to allow that if it gave Russia carte blanche to destroy Ukraine as a nation: they have about 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons which can be used against Ukraine and would be itching to do so: it's easier to pacify a bunch of ruins holding 20 million survivors than an intact nation with 40 million inhabitants and a functioning army (of course, if all declared Russian weapons function as intended, which may be doubtful).

4129,[],False,,Caesim,,,[],,,,text,t2_oedm4,False,False,"I'm German and all my compatriots I know support Ukraine and delivering weapons to Ukraine, most also heavy weapons.

So, the weird part is this, our parliament is made of 6 parties: SPD, CDU, FDP, the Greens, AfD and ""the Left"". The majority of the parliament wants to send heavy weapons to Ukraine (CDU, FDP and the Greens) and recently the parliament made a vote on sending heavy weapons.

The problem however are two things:

1. Our current chancellor's party, the SPD, had historically ties to the soviet union (how involved they were is not completely known), so that the other SPD chancellor we had, Gerhard Schröder, was best buddies with Putin for a long time, after making North Stream 1 as a chancellor. And right now, the SPD is awfully stagnant on the Ukraine war.

2. The deeper problem is Germany's history and that connection to Russia. Following WWII and all that, one major view on war that formed was what I call ""extreme pacifism"". Do you know that John Lennon song where he says ""imagine there's a war and nobody shows up to fight""? Too many people really believe that. That the consequence of WWII should be that Germany should not be involved in wara Period. This is mostly followed in leftist circles but that has swept into the mainstream.

3. The other problem has to do with Russia. Russia managed to portray itself as the main victim of Nazi Germany. This led many Germans, to see Russia more as a victim. Russian propaganda also managed to sweep under the rug that some of the truly brutal parts of WWII happened in Ukraine, but people didn't really pick that up.

4. Lastly, following the German Reunification, and the obligations (I read that soviet memorials in Germany may not be dismantled as part of the agreement) many people/ politicians feel that Germany has to be grateful towards Russia and it shouldn't be angered.

All in all, we have a really weird mix here in Germany, but when the invasion started, many people actually woke up and saw Russia as what it actually is. Sadly, for some reason the SPD hasn't yet and most of Germany is puzzled why.

Don't get me wrong, there are voices, saying ""sending weapons to Ukraine makes it worse"", ""German politicians demanding to send heavy weapons to Ukraine are war mongerers"" etc, but each day these voices get quieter, especially with images like thos of Bucha coming out.",308ad7ebcd03e7293788fc8984f6367fdb3afe24,True,False,,,,,0,1653994091,,0,{},ianckaz,False,t3_v1km94,False,True,t1_ian41iw,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v1km94/fdp_presents_scholz_tank_ultimatum_this_is/ianckaz/,1653994102,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653965291.0,

Something about 9 historical land access routes into Russia, if Russians control them, they can easily defend their territory. Without control over them, they can be invaded and conquered. And for some reason, real or not, Putin believes they must regain control of them. 

That is a problem because 3 or4 are now in NATO, or western aligned countries that were once in the Soviet Union. 

On the map it looks like you can just drive from Madrid to Moscow if you wanted to, but in reality, the harshness of terrain, and natural resistance to massive armies traversing there, comes done to these 9 corridors. Think about defending a castle, if your walls are impenetrable, you really only need to put guards at the doors. 

So either Putin was made aware, or is just demented enough to believe the west was coming for Russia at some point. But I’m reality all he has done is allowed a bulk of his forces to smash against Ukrainian resolve, and further alienate his people from the rest of the world. 

If he is successful in getting through to Moldova, I believe that Russia will push past into other countries, using the nuclear threat of MAD, to overcome article 5.

The weapons they need that will turn the tide are still promised on paper, mothballed in another country or 'on the way'. 

Russia continues to find its war by selling its oil and gas to the world and most of  Europe, China and India continue to buy it.

&gt;One of the most comprehensive equations is Numbeo's Quality of Life Index, which measures eight indices: purchasing power (including rent), safety, health care, cost of living, property price to income ratio, traffic commute time, pollution, and climate. Purchasing power, cost of living, and property price to income ratio are all measures of the average citizen's financial wherewithal in a country, which connects directly to the standard of living.

Also quite telling that you actually believe that the government in Ukraine got overthrown by anyone else but it's own people. There was no conspiracy, no CIA coup... and even if there was (there wasn't), IT STILL DOES NOT FREAKING LEGITIMIZE INVADING UKRAINE.

&gt; May 28 - A ship has entered the Ukrainian port of Mariupol for the first time since Russia completed its capture of the city to load metal and ship it east to Russia, TASS news agency reported on Saturday, in a move that Kyiv decried as looting.

&gt; Ukraine&amp;#039;s largest steelmaker Metinvest on Friday said it was concerned that Russia may use several ships stranded in Mariupol to &amp;quot;Steal and smuggle metallurgical products&amp;quot; belonging to the group.

If Ukraine had held on to those nukes, not only would that have incurred direct costs for maintenance and such, but it also would've cost a HUGE amount of goodwill, trade &amp; support during the '90s. If Ukraine had held a nuclear arsenal, they would have been ostracized by NATO, EU and others. 

These costs are especially high in return for the highly doubtful ratio of deterrence a small number of nukes offer: you and I may have differing opinions in some respects (judging from the downvotes you've been giving me) but I think we can find common ground in the assumption that Putin is enough of a maniac to allow for Moscow, St. Petersburg and Volgograd to be targeted with nukes if that furthers his cause. This guy just. doesnt. give. a. fuck. 

Worse still, had Ukraine possessed nuclear weapons, Putin might have come up a more credible casus belli over the last few years. Have you seen how many idiots lap up the filth RT and its ilk have been spreading world wide? If Ukraine had held a nuclear arsenal, this support would've been even stronger. 

Look, I understand the sentiment, but ""peace through MAD"" and nuclear deterrence have proven themselves to be pipe dreams. If Ukraine had had nukes, it wouldn't have changed the Russian's objectives, but it WOULD have changed Ukraine's strategic readiness &amp; the amount of support it receives.

Officials said late Monday that the goal in sending the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System—or GMLRS—is to boost Ukraine’s firepower against Russian troops who have invaded the country’s Donbas region, without enabling Kyiv to expand the war deep into Russian territory.  


**It couldn’t be determined how many of the GMLRS rockets the U.S. would provide. One official said they could arrive in Ukraine within weeks. Training on their use would begin quickly and take at least 10 days.**  


U.S. officials said that the GMLRS will give Ukraine the capability to strike Russian targets throughout the Donbas area in eastern Ukraine.  
  
The system is manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corp., which describes the rockets as among the “MLRS family of munitions” since they can be fired from either an MLRS tracked launcher or a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System wheeled launcher.

The ""weak and small"" neighbor they invaded on their own terms and timeline has killed 30k soldiers and destroyed thousands of vehicles, so that 3 months in  Russia can barely push further than 100km from it's own border?

100km is nothing, a bus will travel that far in under two hours.

Plus they managed to lose one of their most important ships and likely added two important countries to NATO.

&gt;they still want to fight even though they know they are facing not just Ukraine but NATO as well.

They're not facing NATO, they're facing Ukraine with NATO weapons.

&gt;Moreover, they outnumber the Ukrainian population (41 million) at a ratio of 4.5 to 1.

And what do you think is the ratio when you only include the ones willing to risk their lives and fight in this war? I bet the ratio tightens up quite a bit.

They've utterly destroyed their international claim to it — something that previously they were managing to sneak under the wire.  They've made mortal, multi-generational enemies of a population that might have actually been sympathetic to them, so they're looking at an afghanistan-style insurrection in the absolute ""best case"" where there's a peace deal with territory in their hands.  And finally; they're just blowing their military out and shredding all of their gear and military capabilities, weakening themselves to the point where there's a real risk that when Ukraine hits back, Russia's army will have become so weak it won't be able to resist the counteroffensive.

&amp;#x200B;

It's really like putin thinks that if he ""gets"" a piece of ground, it's russia's forever.   It makes no sense.

I'm reminded of being back in middle school, and watching a schoolmate steal like 20 single-serve cartons of chocolate milk.   And I'm like ""bro, you're physically incapable of possessing that.   You can't drink them fast enough.  They'll spoil before you get them in a fridge...  like  ... why?

Every rebel from the 2000's (that wasn't pardoned) had their relatives either persecuted or forcefully deported. The deported families had their entire houses burned + valuables taken and deported out of Chechnya. These families have now for almost 10 years waited outside of the Polish border and live in poverty. The worst case scenario is being tortured to death and presented as a ""rebel"" which happens a lot in Chechnya.

4497,[],False,,SebboNL,,,[],,,,text,t2_biwyk,False,False,"Those nukes were very problematic for a number of reasons. First off, they were Soviet so their reliability and performance were quite questionable. 
Second, nuclear weapons aren't ordinary ordnance. Especially more modern (say, 1960's and beyond) weapons need a LOT of maintenance, including a periodical rebuild. Ukraine didnt possess the facilities to do so, those were all based in Russia. Hence, in a short while those nukes would've become useless and a very bad investment indeed
Third: creating the infrastructure for maintaining such a stockpile would've been a piss-poor idea from both a financial and a practical perspective. You need specific nuclear reactors to create tritium, and that is hard to do in secret. You need to reverse engineer everything inside a nuclear weapon, from its slapping-foil detonators to the polyurethane spacers filling up the radioation channels and Hohlraum. And you need to be quick about it, because your nukes are steadily degrading...
Fourth: it would've been political suicide. Nukes are like the plague, any country with an active development project is ostracized and becomes a pariah on the international stage. Also, the world was quite different back then: peace had broken out and Ukraine was seen as a go-between for the West and what remained of the USSR. Everyone was hopeful. Should we have known better? Oh HELL YEAH. But we trusted Russia to remain as ""peaceful"" and ""good of will"" as it appeared under Gorbatchev and Yeltsin. 

If Ukraine had demanded to keep those Soviet nukes (responsibiltity of which was transferred to its succesor state of Russia as per the NPT, I believe), it would have done them no good whatsoever. Ukraine made the right call in getting rid of those nukes, it is the west who fucked up by having a miopic vision of Russia and its future leaders.",0f57419a8da96c1c36f69afd8af5a3e7e651e996,True,False,,,,,0,1653988659,,0,{},ian67hs,False,t3_v17iri,False,True,t1_ialb13z,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v17iri/ukrainian_presidential_office_russians_hysterical/ian67hs/,1653988670,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653959859.0,

First, I have to say that the Ukrainian Air Force, PVO, and other units have been brave, incredible, amazing.  Their results in the defense of Ukraine are outstanding.  Slava Ukraini!

However, and I hate to be ""that guy"", but Ukrainian claims to have destroyed 208 non-drone, non-helicopter, non-cruise missile fixed wing aircraft have been repeatedly and thoroughly shown to be untrue and likely to exceed the real total by a factor of 4, 5, 6, or maybe even more.   As of a few days ago, the US estimate of the number of RU fixed wing losses was about 3 dozen.  This is consistent with most other analyses and it includes several cases where the crash site has not been found.

Please, armchair generals - don't start again with the ""oh damaged aircraft may have limped back across the russian border"" or ""why do you think the americans know better.."" stuff.  This has all been done to death.  The forests and lakes of Ukraine are NOT dotted with IL76 after IL76.  They're just not.

I make no comment about the other figures.  My comments are simply to temper the fixed wing numbers claimed.

4627,[],False,,SebboNL,,,[],,,,text,t2_biwyk,False,False,"Thats not entirely factual. The maintenance of (especially modern) nuclear weapons is prohibitively expensive for most nations (and may in fact be a reason for Russia's nuclear readiness to be way lower than we've come to expect).

Modern nuclear warheads use a boosted fission design for a number of reasons. First, for explosive power as it allows for a higher &amp; even a variable yield (""dial-a-yield"" in US parlance). Second, it allows for a more efficient bomb to be created, using up to 40% less fissionable material, which is hard to produce &amp; very expensive. Third, a boosted fission design mitigates quite a bit of the nastier isotopes in the fall-out produced by an explosion, so a bomb is ""greener"" and thus more acceptable for use close to home. Also, a BF bomb is a LOT smaller than a non-boosted design, which makes actually launching the damned thing easier/cheaper, and finally that it's higher neutron flux greatly improves it's capabilities for being used as a primary  in a multistaged Teller-Ulam/""H-bomb"" design or as an Enhanced Radiation (""neutron bomb"") warhead.   
Is is good news? No, as such a design requires tritium, a somewhat radioactive and very expensive isotope of hydrogen that decays into Helium-3 at a rate of 50%/11-or-so years.   
You do NOT want He-3 anywhere near your nuclear bomb when it needs to go off, as it actively impedes its function. So, the tritium must be filtered replenished about once a year with the He-3 being discarded in order to keep a nuclear weapon operable. With tritium costing $30,000 a gramme commercially, this is a very expensive undertaking indeed. Even more so considering that nobody will sell you the tritium if you're going to make bombs out of it (commercial production is about a pound annually either way) you're going to have to build your own supply chain.

Then, there's the fact that plutonium and uranium show some radioactivity themselves. It's only a little bit, of course, but over the course of a few years the decay and the effects its products have on the bomd itself add up. The molecular matrix of the polymers in which the explosives for the explosive lenses are bonded degrade and deform, forming voids. The cladding of the fissile material (the ""pit"") begins to peel off, allowing corrosion to occur. The actual geometry of the pit may be altered by the combined action of nuclear particles and gravity!

Azov Regiment's appeal to Russia.

""Catch the thief!"" is usually the loudest shouted by the thief himself. Kremlin propaganda calls us Nazis and fascists, and themselves liberators who have come to ""denazify"" Ukraine. Today, the whole world lives in a time of great deceptions, big lies and tiny truths. Billions of dollars are spent to create the illusion of greatness and to promote the anti-human ideas of the ""Russian world. The same one that brings destruction, death, suffering, hunger and fear. The only weapon in this struggle remains the Truth. And the truth is this: our land was attacked by a treacherous monster, and it is our right and duty to defend it.

At the forefront of this defense stands Azov. Azov is a National Guard unit that was formed from volunteers in 2014, after Russia took away Krym, part of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. It is a unit in which Ukrainians, Russians, Jews, Greeks, Georgians, Crimean Tatars and Belarusians serve. In this unit for 8 years soldiers of different faiths have been defending hand in hand: Orthodox, Catholics, Protestants, Gentiles, Jews and Muslims. Where the majority speaks Russian.

We despise Nazism and Stalinism. Because our country suffered the most from these totalitarian regimes and false ideologies. Russia bombs Babin Yar, where the victims of twentieth-century Nazism are buried. Putinists drop tons of shells on hospitals, schools, kindergartens, and churches. Putin's soldiers shoot the elderly, kill children and pregnant women, just as the Hilers once did. Nazism is the unquenchable need to kill people who dare to be free. It is the certainty of one's right as a certain super nation and it is the certainty of the right to rule over other nations while raping and pillaging other nations. Doesn't it remind you of anything?

The difference is that Azov was, is and will be a shield for Ukraine until the occupant leaves our country. We have never attacked anyone, and the main goal of Azov is to protect and develop our country, our people, and the lives of our citizens are more important than the ambitions of any politician. We, the defenders of the hero-city of Mariupol, have taken up the shield and sword, which protect not only Ukraine from the forces of evil and lies, but also the entire civilized world from the plague of the 21st century.

If we put the sword down, tomorrow the same fate will befall Kyiv and Lviv, and the day after tomorrow Warsaw, Berlin and Paris. To thinking Russian people we want to wish to overthrow that government which sends the sinews to the certain death for the sake of false illusions of the poisoned reality, instead of that people of Russia lived, loved and developed.",211d7c7ecccd3d0ea5d34cf52e3eebc34ee76875,True,False,,,,,0,1653987000,,0,{},ian4exw,False,t3_v1kxrw,False,True,t1_ian2ec2,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v1kxrw/azov_battalion_drops_neonazi_symbol_exploited_by/ian4exw/,1653987012,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653958200.0,

Could be faster but it's pretty though to build that much production in 4-7 years.

It wouldn't be safer tho since work accidents on those lead to more deaths and such per kwh so far.

I'd say more economical depends on how long you let those plants run and if you take in all externalities (the grid adjustments cost too, solar panel recycling is a scam atm, storage or variable output (gas) costs a ton in many places and completely tips the scales, etc)

&gt;Worse, the west gets a lot of its fissionable materials from Russia.

And doesn't need to since the list of countries producing is long and the cost and transport of fissible material is a small part of the overall cost. A non issue.

On the other hand our greens &amp; co are arguing for gas to run our baseline and to provide variable output over the course of at least 30 years. For gas the previously mentioned points do apply and guess who's involved in that market.

Putin could own all the uranium output of all those countries like canada, australia, various african and asian countries....and still would make not even 1/8th of what gazprom brings in.

A nuclear plant with a tested design built en masse can be put up in 6-8 years today. especially as experience grows in constructing these and the constructors know that the European market will grow in the foreseeable future, they can invest in standardization and put them up in 3-4 years by 2030. Prefab construction baby.

5. Chernobyl is literally impossible with 4th Gen reactors, which are physically unable to reach meltdown even when all cooling water evaporates. They are designed to keep cool enough by convection when surrounded by air.

6. Nuclear waste is severely overrated as a danger. 95% of the nuclear waste produced by a nuclear plant is so called low- or medium-grade, which reaches the radioactivity of a banana in 40 years. In the meantime it gets solidified into a sort of ceramic with glass and surrounded by concrete. It is impossible to make bombs out of it or for it to leak. It's not a fluid.

7. The remaining 5% of high-grade nuclear waste is indeed very radioactive for a long time. However, there are already designs for small nuclear reactors which use the heat generated by this waste to provide more energy and in the meantime drasticly reduce its radioactivity. After that it can be stored deep underground where nobody or nothing will ever get into contact with it. Also: a nuclear plant will produce less than a truckload of this stuff over its entire lifetime of 40 ish years.

TLDR: don't hate on nuclear. It's a good way to assist green energy to completely replace fossil, and we will need both.",38eb7d62fae8b254a877d4f60d557fd489edaa6f,True,False,,,,,0,1653986089,,0,{},ian3ezg,False,t3_v1bmzj,False,True,t1_iamyy4g,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v1bmzj/breaking_news_the_european_union_to_ban_90_oil/ian3ezg/,1653986103,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653957289.0,

Chechnya, Tatarstan, Buryatia, and many of the other Russian republics (misleading word—they're like Puerto Rico) are Muslim as well; in fact a good ton of the Russian war criminals are (allegedly) Muslim (no matter that the Qur'an specifically warns against rape as a tool of war).  Bosniaks are Muslim (granted, they're not in Russia).  Muslims fight on both sides of the Ukrainian War and you'll hear ""Allahu Akbar"" fairly often when someone makes a good shot.

Putin **has** said that radical Wahhabi Islamists (of the Saudi or al-Qaeda type) are evil.  But in this the Western world agree with him.

It's not what he says; it's what he does.  The RF government is known for accusing people they don't like (i.e. who protest against them in legal ways) of Islamist terror, and then sending thugs to beat them up or kill them. 

Chechnya **did** have a radical terrorist problem.

*OLHA HLUSHCHENKO - TUESDAY, 31 MAY 2022, 04:12*  
  
*The Ukrainian Armed Forces have killed 78 Russian troops and destroyed Russian tanks, howitzers, and other equipment while defending the southern borders of Ukraine.*  
  
*Source: Pivden (South) Operational Command*  
  
*Quote: ""Failing to succeed in its advance, the enemy is stepping up air and artillery and mortar strikes.*  
  
*Two Mi-24 helicopters struck twice at our positions, and during the day the enemy shelled the area around Mykolaivka, including settlements to the rear of our units, three times with long-range Pion artillery and the Uragan multiple-launch rocket system.""*  
  
*Details: During a successful offensive by Ukrainian Defence Forces units on the Pivdennyi Buh front, Russian forces left the village of Mykolaivka, north of Kherson \[there are several villages with the name Mykolaivka in Kherson Oblast, and it is not clear from the summary of the General Staff which one we are talking about - ed.\].*  
  
*Ukrainian missile and artillery units inflicted significant losses on the Russian forces during the day: a total of 78 troops were killed, and 8 tanks, 2 howitzers, a Pion self-propelled gun, 2 Grad multiple rocket launchers, 5 armoured vehicles, and 2 vehicles were destroyed.*  
  
*In the Black Sea, Russian ships continue to carry out operations to block shipping and work in the ports.*  
  
*One carrier of Kalibr-type sea-launched cruise missiles is in readiness to use its missiles.*  
  
*A Dyugon landing craft and two Raptor patrol boats are moving towards the island in order to support the Russian units on Zmiinyi (Snake) Island.*  
  
*""At the same time, the enemy surface ships are carefully keeping their distance from mainland Ukraine for fear of being hit by missiles,"" the report reads.*  
  
*Storms continue to dump enemy sea mines on the coast of Odesa Oblast. One that was discovered and defused in time was fished out on Monday and taken to a safe location for controlled detonation.*",ab1457b0311c85d7795dcadcdbe34d5e3e3b69d5,True,False,,,,,0,1653983142,,0,{},ian06rs,True,t3_v1kykn,False,True,t3_v1kykn,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v1kykn/pivden_south_ukrainian_armed_forces_kill_78/ian06rs/,1653983155,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653954342.0,

No, it doesn't. Having a state language isn't cultural genocide. Cultural genocide is the attempt to destroy an ethnicity, with one notable difference from just genocide, you aren't murdering them.

Just a state language is not cultural genocide. You have to actively try to destroy all of the cultural heritage. For example, Sweden made the Sami language illegal, outlawed their religion, destroyed their religious artifacts, forbade their music,  forced them to go to church, forced them to change to Swedish names, forced their kids to go to Swedish boarding schools, forced the Sami to work with transporting silver from the silver mines, and paying them less than a living wage, stole their lands from them, under the guise of being nice by giving them ""grazing rights"" (before they didn't need grazing rights, as the land was theirs). Once Sami was starting the get rights, they were then ONLY given to Sami that were nomadic reindeer herders, if you were not you were not allowed to have the status of Sami, and hence were still forced to behave like a Swede, and any permanent buildings could be destroyed as they could not possibly belong to anyone, because Sami, per definition, was nomadic.

THAT was cultural genocide.

A state language is not.

The FDP politician also calls for a ""transparent communication of German services to Ukraine"" (for security reasons after delivery), as well as a special coordinator for arms deliveries.

 FDP foreign affairs expert Alexander Graf Lambsdorff (55) supports the Marten demand: ""It would be the first Western battlefield tank in Donbass, but the Ukrainian armed forces must be able to transport their soldiers protected. This is what the marten does – and its fighting power is well below that of the cheetah, whose delivery has already been decided by the Federal Government.""",e48f4aaf27e8a9cabbc9f6847009adfda7b6d484,True,False,,,,,0,1653981495,,0,{},iamybwm,True,t3_v1km94,False,True,t3_v1km94,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v1km94/fdp_presents_scholz_tank_ultimatum_this_is/iamybwm/,1653981507,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653952695.0,

Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI, $6 billion): This special fund, established in 2016 National Defense Authorization Act (section 1250), provides training, equipment, weapons, logistic support, supplies and services, salaries and stipends, sustainment, and intelligence support to the military and national security forces of Ukraine―i.e., just about anything Ukraine might need. The USAI is a transfer account, which means that DOD will decide later where the money goes. Congress has typically not liked transfer accounts because they look like ""slush funds,"" where Congress has less control over how the money is ultimately spent. The statutory language requires that DOD report to Congress 15 days before any transfers occur. In theory, Congress could block such transfers, but that is difficult to do politically and procedurally.
A problem with USAI is that the capabilities it funds may take a while to deliver to Ukrainian frontline forces. While supplies and services can be acquired quickly, new equipment takes months or years to produce.

Replenishment of U.S. weapons stocks ($9 billion): This provides money for DOD to replace items sent to Ukraine in the past or in the future. The White House press announcement cites artillery, armored vehicles, anti-tank, and antiair capabilities. DOD is not necessarily replacing items like-for-like, but may substitute similar capabilities where the previous items are unavailable or obsolescent. The amount ($9 billion) is nearly three times the stated cost of equipment drawdown provided to date ($3.3 billion) implying that the replacements will be more expensive and that there will be additional drawdown in the future. As with the USAI, the secretary of defense must notify the congressional defense committees of the details of such transfers not less than 15 days before any such transfer.
Note: There is a difference between drawdown authority and funding. With authorization from Congress, the president has the authority to draw down stocks of weapons and send them to friendly countries like Ukraine. However, funding to replace these lost stocks must be provided separately. DOD has been using money from an earlier supplemental to replace equipment sent to Ukraine, but that money is apparently running out. This provides funds to continue backfilling stockpiles. Authority for additional drawdown is provided separately (see below). The administration has not provided a detailed accounting of the drawdown or supplemental funding.

Foreign Military Financing Program ($4 billion): This program, run by the Department of State, allows Ukraine and other countries to buy new military equipment, not just get items from existing stocks. This is a long-term effort, however, since procurement of large weapon systems has a multiyear lead time. Procurement of smaller items is quicker, but it still takes months or years.",bbe0f541ed30dee1f5614f40030dc62599dfa378,True,False,,,,,0,1653976880,,0,{},iamsqwb,False,t3_v1iakx,False,True,t1_iamskvk,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v1iakx/the_wsj_editorial_board_sometimes_its_hard_to/iamsqwb/,1653976896,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653948080.0,

From another cursory glance military basic training takes approximately a minimum of 10 weeks, and I think Ukraine sending out forces well before that time frame.

&gt;That's not a proper rotation of forces 

What I meant is that some troops have already been rotated back to Russia on rest leave that will be cycled back. I'm sure not all of their retreats were strategic in nature, but some have been to provide distraction from other combat zones.

&gt;If Ukraine didn't have Western arms, then sure. But they do. 

It seems to me that sooner than later, Ukraine won't have the required trained personnel to operate the equipment being sent to them.

&gt;As long as the Ukrainian fighting spirit holds (and there is no reason at the moment to doubt it will break) - Russia ability to conduct extensive combat operations will be done in a few months.

No doubt the Ukranian army's fighting spirit is commendable and valiant, but I've already seen reports of disgruntled troops and men actively avoiding conscription. I disagree with you that Russia will lose logistical and operational capacity in a few months.

Yes that’s the point. A future of not living under brutal authoritarian regime is what they are fighting for.

Yep he’s doing what best for his people by ensuring that they will still be able to live in a democratic country. Also it’s better to emulate a Winston Churchill than a Neville Chamberlain. You know how appeasing Hitler went right?

Yes, but that's already been happening.  UKR forces are going to be coming out of basic training, are fighting on home soil, fighting a defense war, etc 

&gt;Isn't Russia already doing so? They've managed to take approximately 20% of Ukrainian territory and have managed to conduct rotations for troops in the field.

Russia retreated from Kyiv and then forced those units back into the line.  That's not a proper rotation of forces 

&gt;When I try to view the military conflict from an objective standpoint, it seems like a war of attrition where the Ukrainian side will run out of able combat personnel before the Russians will.

If Ukraine didn't have Western arms, then sure.  But they do.  

As it stands, Russia's war objectives keep shrinking while UKR's keep increasing.  That usually doesn't happen when a state is losing a war.  At the start of this - Russia wanted to end an independent state ruled from Kyiv.  That's not happening.  Now they are pulling T-62s from cold storage (from the 60s!) In order to keep troops mechanized while the average trooper armed with just a LAW now can pierce Russian armor.  

As long as the Ukrainian fighting spirit holds (and there is no reason at the moment to doubt it will break) - Russia ability to conduct extensive combat operations will be done in a few months.",4874274e8156b9353f6d51a40343f425daccf9cc,True,False,,,,,0,1653970484,,0,{},iamjmd4,False,t3_u7w8nf,False,True,t1_iamj2st,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/u7w8nf/ukrainianconflict_megathread_6/iamjmd4/,1653970502,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653941684.0,

No one said it was *justified*, that was your own bias reading into something that wasn't said.  But when something happens you have to respond and create the best outcome, not cry that it shouldn't have happened and pretend that your future decisions are the fault of the initial incident.  Every decision is on the person who makes it.

If Putin dies in a decade and the Russian federation implodes again, was getting 100,000 Ukrainians killed fighting him worth the slim chance of winning this war?  *Even if* they win, those people are still dead and half a trillion in infrastructure is destroyed that could have been avoided.  That's the only thing about this war that's a sure thing, the rest of the future is fluid, but those losses are locked in and irreversible now.  A pyrrhic victory. 

When your only metric for success is ""whatever it takes"" without any foresight or context, then of course you're just going to throw dead bodies at the problem until you win or someone stops you.  That's the situation that both Zelensky and Putin have set up, but only one of them was a democratically elected president that's supposed to be doing what's best for his people, not using them as cannon fodder because he wants to act out a real life Winston Churchill parody where he's the underdog that prevails at a great cost.",c690814a0c401faa64fe62ee81738a43639eead1,True,False,,,,,0,1653970152,,0,{},iamj3vb,False,t3_v139a0,False,True,t1_iamip2g,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v139a0/russian_state_tvs_olga_skabeyeva_says_it_might_be/iamj3vb/,1653970169,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653941352.0,

Yea since even the Taliban ""winning"" has just caused them to now have to try and run an isolated country slowly losing it's only ally in Pakistan due to ideology with no money, anybody with an education and a few bucks trying to leave, drought, political infighting galore well fighting their own Taliban on the far right (which is crazy since we're talking about the literal Taliban here) and the left of them. They don't even have a single, universally respected leader like they did in the 90's with Mullah Omar and now it's pretty much every warlord for themselves, hence the radical differences in rules from province to province. 

I honestly think they overplayed their hand by taking the cities. They knew the war was won once America forced their ally to release 5,000 of their veterans and after a three month offensive, had managed to isolate most cities and take control over the major routes. The government was trying desperately to make some sort of deal and even sent out the former warlords to try and salvage the satiation (which in all honesty they should have done much sooner but nobody ever called the former Afghan government competent). 

But they pushed their luck and started taking cities as the ANA started cutting deals to again, not literally die in two weeks than decided to negotiate in good faith as they held all the cards and were right outside of Kabul only for Ghani and the former government to dip because they didn't want to be Najibullah-ed. They then looked like a bunch of barbarians invading Rome to the international media. They're even slowly bringing back their draconian rules, further pushing out the educated minority needed to actually run the country. It's not about if they'll fall, it's about how soon and how much they could fuck up the country before that.

So despite them ""winning"", they're still going to lose in the long run.

&gt; Russian shelling has reduced much of Sievierodonetsk to ruins and Russian troops have entered the city&amp;#039;s southeastern and northeastern fringes, but the Ukrainian defence has slowed the wider Russian campaign across the Donbas region.

I figure that to try to hold all that territory on the cheap without enough people, after enraging the locals, firebases that cover each other are the only long-term solution the Russians have.  And it will play right into the hands of the raid-loving Ukrainians.

While the Russians and French fought, the Russians would fall back slowly, getting to safer places, living on land, and also destroying more of France’s forces. 

Meanwhile, the French were gaining territory but ultimately at a huge price: Lowing so many forces and a drop in morale as the fighting kept going. When the French were at their weakest point, the Russians did a full on scale counteroffensive on them. This is also similar to what the Russians did to Nazi Germany when being invaded.

Basically, it looks as if the Ukrainians are baiting the Russians by giving them some territory, but at the price of losing tons of their military power.

&gt;nervous paranoia of a Ukrainian [supporter]

I mean that. My information comes from reading the news, and I know basically nothing about military affairs. Before the war I figured Russia would obliterate the Ukrainian government, because I'd read that Russia was a not-quite peer to the US militarily and figured it would look similar to Gulf War 2 +/- a long insurgency. But I remembered Crimea being taken without much of a fight, and kinda sorta expected that when I heard the invasion had begun.

So let's put me where I belong - in the category of the uninformed masses. Also the relieved masses, in that I'm thrilled Ukraine has done so much better than I was led to expect. In an attempt to be better informed, I'd like to know what your confidence level looks like when you claim

&gt;Russia is about to drop dead

The best way to gauge that is to ask, what would prove you wrong? Ie if Russia is still doing exactly what it's doing now in a year, I think that would count as this being a false prediction. What about a month or two? Six? 

I swear this isn't a gotcha question either, *I really have no idea what the answer is supposed to be.* I just feel like I keep reading that Russia is near beaten and I want some estimate of when that will be. Obviously you aren't going to tell me, ""July 23, 2022 will be the day that the last Russian is chased off Ukrainian territory;"" again, it would look more like, ""my theory that Russia is about to drop dead would be incorrect if Russia is still maintaining anything that resembles this level of activity in Ukraine in three months.""

I sincerely hope you're right, and it's in my nature to be pessimistic about stuff like this.

In the long term it might end up for the better, imagine a scenario where Kadyrov attacks a NATO, triggering the full terms of the alliance and resulting, presumably, in an invasion and takeover of the Chechen Republic.  

We can guess it might go fairly quickly as it seems the people aren't all that willing to fight, and NATO are particularly good at what Russia has recently failed very badly at.  

NATO would very quickly annihilate radar, SAMs, airfields and other notable defenses, then, with firmly established air superiority, eradicate most of the rest of the armed forces before NATO land forces are up to full speed.

The question in such a fanciful scenario (as Kadyrov is most certainly full of shit and sabre rattling out of terrible fear and insecurity) is whether Russia would then directly engage NATO or not.   I suspect they may not, they are already stretched far too thin (T-62s!) in Ukraine, and would abandon the Chechen Republic to NATO.

Russia doesn't have the luxury the US has of being the entire world away. They made enemies on their doorstep and a lot of them are ready for it.

That would absolutely qualify as a strong NATO response. A weak response would involve little more than sanctions and increased economic and proxy warfare.

NATO's current unity and response is happening for several reasons, but the biggest is that Russia overplayed it's hand. They've over-used the threat of nuclear escalation with no follow through - that has emboldened NATO members to throw as much military support to Ukraine as they could. If Russia actually commits a nuclear strike, Western leaders might not be as bold.

I'm not saying NATO would absolutely respond this way. I'm saying Russia's government could become desperate enough to make a bet on a weak response followed be deescalation whether or not that would actually work.

&gt;A drawing a line in a sand can backfire hard. Like my original comment said a non-stop bombing campaign until Russia doesn't have the ability to even turn on a radar dish

Russia should have known their invasion of Ukraine would backfire hard.

# Translation 

*The Russians transfer  *Grad* and *Tornado-G* to Snake Island. These can shoot at merchant ships, like those to carry grain.  Therefore, *Harpoons* alone will be insufficient to open the Ukrainian Black Sea ports.*

Multiple sources have told *Defense Express* that the occupiers have started collecting multiple rocket launchers on Snake Island—at least two BM-21 *Grad* installations and at least one Tornado-G MLRS.

Further, the enemy also transferred the following there: three *Pantsir* S-1 [Greyhound] air defense systems; one *Tor-M2* anti-aircraft missile system, with a transport and charging vehicle; five military vehicles; and one MT-LB amphibious tracked vehicle (like equipped with an electronic warfare station). 


Further, the orcs have likely deployed an air defense navigation post (aviation guidance station?) on the island.  And also - that they are going to transfer even more equipment, once they have brought up their sunken landing craft, the *Serna* class vessel, which allows use not only the primary, but also a small pier on the island.


A few days ago, on May 21, 2022, there was an episode when the Russian military threatened to open fire on a civilian merchant ship *Britta K*, a vessel under the flag of Togo, coming from Romania, in transit through the waters around  Snake Island.  [Audaciously and mendaciously announced that the vessel was in the territorial waters of the Russian Federation.] This episode indicates that the occupiers are morally ready to shoot at civilian foreign merchant ships, especially those with Ukrainian grain, which can now be loaded in Romanian ports.


It was believed that Russia would try to build their *Bal* anti-ship complex, which would have X-35 missiles, on the island, in order to broaden and strengthen their so-called ""closed access zone"" of the Black Sea. But, apparently, Russians themselves called that option “a monstrosity.”  So, given the current situation, rocket-propelled grenade launchers could also be a means of destroying civilian ships.


Altogether, these circumstances indicate that the Harpoon anti-ship missiles will be insufficient to unblock Ukraine's ports on the Black Sea. Therefore, a comprehensive mission from the United States and our NATO allies is needed to restore freedom of navigation in the Black Sea region.


*Note: other commercial vessels have been impacted—several have been sunk by Russia—but this author does not reference those.",801c0cd8fc15b47809679276dd5e37145b18c90d,True,False,,,,,0,1653962580,,0,{},iam5mh2,True,t3_v1fjkd,False,True,t3_v1fjkd,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v1fjkd/new_weapons_systems_on_snake_island/iam5mh2/,1653962595,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653933780.0,

Nor do I sense any attempt by them to hide their feelings about the bad way the war has gone.  They know they haven't succeeded in conquering the country, but OTOH they also see that they have seized a significant chunk of Ukrainian territory.  The over all feeling I get from the Russian public is one of resolution - they still want to fight even though they know they are facing not just Ukraine but NATO as well.   

I didn't mention Afghanistan for two reasons.  One, the Russians never saw that as part of the motherland, and two their casualties there were relatively low.  So I don't see that war being germane to this situation.  

I think you totally misunderstand the Russian view of Ukraine.  To most Russians it is an integral part of the motherland.  There's no denying that it was part of both Imperial Russia and the USSR for over 300 years.  Thus to say this war is different than WW1 or 2 ignores both Russian history and Russian culture.  You're also ignoring that up until recently a large part of the country spoke Russian and identified as same.  That has changed significantly since Ukrainian independence, but many in Russia have never accepted that.  That is why the older demographic groups in Russia support the war more than the younger ones.

As to demographics, the Russian population is currently about 145 million people.  This compares to the population of the entire Russian empire (including Finland, the Baltics, Armenia, Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and the Turkic republics) of 164 million in 1914.  Thus Russia itself is at about the same size as they were 100 years ago.  Moreover, they outnumber the Ukrainian population (41 million) at a ratio of 4.5 to 1.   With the West afraid to militarily intervene in the conflict, demographically Russia has a huge advantage in this war.  They can afford to wear down Ukraine with artillery, infantry, and tanks; trading lives for small gains but at the same time slowly wearing down the Ukrainian army.

I see a lot of wishful thinking on this sub.  ""The Russians have been humiliated.""  ""The Russians are going to collapse."" Etc, etc.  If we are going to defeat Russia we need to get rid of that.  We face a long struggle.  Possibly one that could stretch on for years.  We should remember that in 1914 everyone though WW1 would be over in 6 weeks.  It lasted 4 gruesome years.  The German army only collapsed when riots broke out in German cities due to the effects of the total blockade of German ports by the British fleet (which itself took 4 years to have its full effect).  Meanwhile today Russian merchant ships roam the seas freely.  If Ukraine is going to win, and if Russia is going to give up its imperial ways, then we need to stop the wishful thinking and do what is necessary to defeat them.  Hemming and hawing about sanctions, continuing to buy Russia oil, holding back critical weapon systems from Ukraine, etc. are not going to defeat Russia anytime soon.",6b56edac5bdf1548e485c2cb021dbc114027328f,True,False,,,,,0,1653962286,,0,{},iam51xz,False,t3_v16aaf,False,True,t1_iakz2mv,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v16aaf/russia1_tv_special_operation_is_over_ww3_began_we/iam51xz/,1653962301,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653933486.0,

...Yes? I mean if you out spend some one 100-1 on your military and do exactly what they said you will do than that's considered a defeat. The most famous Taliban quote of all time was ""They have all the clocks, we have all the time"" and guess what, you wanted to get out so badly you forced a third world country fighting a global pandemic to release 5,000 terrorists without even talking to them then gutted their air force which was the only thing that could effectively supply soldiers in such a mountainous country.

And just to really show how badly you fell for their strategy, you told the government you were backing that still held some 80% of the population, despite you shooting them in the foot after forcing them to release thousands of wolves you helped create that come August 31 (2 weeks before the fall), you will stop supplying them with literal bullets no matter what happens as your going to take your ball and go home. 

Than wondered why a bunch of soldiers who weren't paid in months decided they didn't want to literally die in two weeks. Compare that to the Soviets who didn't do that and whose backed government lasted 10 times longer than the one you backed despite fighting a super power funded rebel group well being there for only half the time.

When America really started putting its foot down was at the NATO Summit in the September of 2014, roughly 6months after Russia Invaded and then annexed Crimea and a real threat was posed to NATO.  It was at this summit where Merkel and the rest of NATO’s European members agreed to the 2% in writing.  All of which took place a full two years before trump even won the vote for US presidency, which itself was a full 12months or more before he officially started attacking specific NATO members over their failures to commit 2%GDP.  The funding literally only became an issue after Russian threats, a possible European conflict and financial agreements were made, which happened in 2014.

No one made Germany join NATO or forced them to agree with a 2% funding obligation, they made the decision themselves  and signed their name to it because it was in their best interest and for the first time in 20+ years there is a real reason to fund and participate in NATO to confront a Russian threat and that requires countries to meet their obligations.  

I’m not hating on Germany, I’m openly criticizing and instigating discourse in hopes of understanding how we objectively see the facts of this situation differently.  

&gt;	I think we all thought wars were pretty much a thing of the past.

That statement alone blows my mind, the facts and history of Europe since 2014 has been an unequivocal clear path and lead up to further fighting and power struggles on the European continent.  The amount of ignorance need to not see Russia’s clear and negative intentions is astronomical.

Putting a &gt; at the start of a new line/paragraph makes it a quote.  I do it when I'm responding to something controversial in case people edit their comments since Reddit has no change history, that way it's obvious what I was replying to.

&gt;None of this evil would be happening if Russia hadn’t invaded a sovereign nation. Putin can choose to leave now. Every single drop of blood is on his hands and the hands of those criminals who support the invasion.

And on the flip side, the west also made choices that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians.  Zelensky could have surrendered, or at least not called for guerilla warfare and made his civilians fair game.  Remember the first week of the war when the Russians were backing up their tanks when people walked toward them?  Then came the molotov cocktails and foreign legion and instantly the tone changed.  It was a very predictable escalation.

The west could have also chose to let Ukraine fight and lose, and the war would still be over by now, but the US wanted regime change so they tried to use the Ukrainians as cannon fodder in a proxy war, but both options for regime change failed.

My point is that everything doesn't fall on one dude that attacked, it was his fault for attacking but everyone else made bad choices that led to where we are now.  At the very start of the war I said that if the Russians got bogged down they'd start leveling cities and that's exactly what happened - anyone who wasn't a complete fool knew the exact path this war would take and chose to sacrifice all those soldiers and civilians because they think the cost of lives is worth being independent from Russia.

Zelensky can complain about atrocity all he wants, but he knew what was coming and intentionally made the choice to spend those lives.

I doubt it.  There's layers and layers.  He's said for a long time *before* the invasion that it was too late to get into a tussle with Ukraine (he wanted a nice, quick, and quiet op in 2014—and didn't get it)... now he wants mobilisation because Ukraine is essentially militarised to a *much* higher standard than Russia is... and while he's very **very** far from a peacenik (the other extreme actually) he isn't blind/stupid either.

Remember, the person carrying the warmongers' flag in Russia at present is Ramzan, *don*, Kadyrov.  Along with the GRU, *don*.  Kadyrov in particular is a chickenhawk, who makes ""real"" soldiers (like Strelkov, although he's a spook rather than frontline/PBI) go white.

Strelkov tried to rejoin the FSB recently (as an officer, naturally).  Didn't go anywhere  (kind-of fortunately because I want him still breathing after the conflict).  So I actually have a tiny shred of respect for the guy.

And I *really* don't see Putin turning tail like this, because in the highly macho Russian culture that would **very** clearly, in full view of the public, mark him out as a coward.  He's in between a rock and a hard place.  Or several hard places in fact.  Remember three things about Russian culture: 1) You can't change anything, no matter *what* you do; whatever will be, will be.  2) Disagreements are *never* aired out in public because it shows you as a weakling. 3) Weak = gay (""cock""; *petukh* in Russian).

A single nuke would end the Russian state, in the ultimate example of winning a battle but losing the war. So given that they won't do it, and that if they did, they'd be immediately destroyed, the actual diplomatic power of moving nukes is basically zero.

In 2022, there is not a much larger, much better armed and historically oppressive nation actively trying to dominate and control the political and economic reality of Belgium against its will. No one poisoned Belgium's pro-Belgium presidential candidate in 2004 and falsified the election so its puppet could lead the country. No one carved off an important piece of Belgium as punishment for a second rejection of this puppet leader or his attempts to make Belgium an economic vassal for this country, and no one started an 8 year war in another part of Belgium that csrves out more territory and killed 14,000 people. No one is lying that Belgium or Flemish-speaking people were created by horrid mistake as an artifical construct and threatening to eradicate its sovereignty and its culture, and no one is committing genocide against the Belgian people. No one has a massive disinformation campaign active in Belgium designed to sway the Belgian people to identify with and support this belligerent nation. No one has been illegally seeding the Belgian population with its passports as part of a plot to sway the Belgian vote and carve out territory, and no one invaded Belgium's neighbor in 2008 or maintains frozen conflicts in several of Belgium's neighbors as a plot to stop Belgium or these other nations from joining a military alliance. All this stuff HAS been happening to Ukraine since 2004, and until that time none of these laws or school closures or other things had been in effect.

This is what gets me about all the doom spreaders. I kept seeing ""Russia is learning though"" LMAO. Did they learn to not have shit morale? Did they learn to have proper officers? Did they learn to train their soldiers properly? Did they learn to have operational flexibility?

No. The Russians learn by monkey see, monkey do. Right now they're desperately trying to equip their combat troops with small reconnaissance drones, because they saw the Ukrainians use them well and think that's been the key to Ukraine's success. No, the key to Ukraine's success is innovative, adaptable tactics and strategy throughout the entire command structure. 

I can't think of a time in history when a trash army has beaten a well motivated and innovative enemy. Defeating Ukraine in such circumstances is absurd. Even if everything goes perfect for Russia and they complete an encirclement, they'll trap &lt;10,000 troops of a country with probably a million people under arms. They'll capture/destroy zero heavy equipment, since the region is defended only by light infantry. And first they'll have to spend 3 months reducing the pocket they created, using many times larger numbers of troops, all in the face of furious counterattacks and relentless shelling of their precarious encirclement. Not to mention they'll take many times heavier casualties than all the Ukrainian troops in that pocket.

It has nothing to do with language and a lot to do with the linguistic preferences of those in power - in the case of Wales, a toss up between the power of English speakers, or Welsh speakers. In Ukraine, it's between Ukrainian and Russian ones. 

Lastly, I'll bite. Yes there is a legal basis for the oppression of Welsh. Look at the blue book of treachery.

-The MLRS AND HIMARS are being sent to Ukraine.  

-They can fire a range of missiles different that can travel UP TO 500kms however they can also fire missiles with much shorter ranges 

-To maintain deniability and SLOWLY turn the heat up on Russia they are being sent to Ukraine with the missiles that can “only” travel  70-100km.

70-100km is all Ukraine needs to crush russian forces as those distances are well outside of russian artillery range so it will GREATLY help Ukrainian forces.  Russia also has MLRS systems that can fire quite far but generally they have proven to be rather inaccurate 

Poland last week just HAPPENED to have ordered a pile of MLRS systems from the U.S in almost perfect timing with the ones being sent to Ukraine.  Poland will definitely be receiving a good amount of ammunition with their order including the long range variants…

Russia/ Putin knows all of this… it isn’t news to them nor are they missing the threat that you can read between the lines.  If the 70-100km range MLRS systems don’t put an end to Russias bullshit war I’m sure Poland will send over some long range goods for Ukraine to shift the Russian perspective on home soil as the (majority) of the Russian public has been to gutless to act against their governments war crimes.",7d2370a3a74275c17f54d0e41d1aaedb2a5924ce,True,False,,,,,0,1653957582,,0,{},ialvuep,False,t3_v16jjv,False,True,t3_v16jjv,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v16jjv/republican_congressman_slams_biden_for_refusing/ialvuep/,1653957594,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653928782.0,

That is not the situation we are in.  Russia does not hold itself accountable.  In fact, it holds Ukraine accountable for Russia's own actions.   

Have you ever closely known an actual, destruction-seeking narcissist before?  I have, but I think you have not.  Let me tell you how the operate.

Nothing you say will convince them of anything.  Your words mean nothing to them and your attempts to hold them accountable mean nothing to them because they do not recognize truth as something that needs to be acknowledged.  Their world is one of spinning lies at every turn and making every single thing your fault.  They do not see truth and accountability as a vulnerability.  The see your willingness to abide by truth and accountability as a vulnerability of ***yours*** and they will exploit it at every opportunity.  The way you deal with these people is to pay no attention to what they say.  The sounds spilling from their mouths have no value.  You must simply carry on with what you are doing and achieve your goal (divorce, child custody, having them arrested or imprisoned, or, as in this case, winning a war by striking valuable targets wherever they may be).  To listen to a narcissist is to give them power to deceive, to manipulate, to blame, and to engage in another round of destructive behavior, constantly keeping you off guard while you pointlessly and failingly try to argue with them in order to show that what they have said is provably false.  They don't care if something is provably false.  It's of absolutely no concern to them.  Their entire MO is to keep you off balance with a ceaseless barrage of lies and false accusations in order to achieve whatever goal they're trying to achieve (and sometimes they don't even know, themselves, what that goal is).  They only know how to torpedo stability and they thrive on that destruction.  To ignore them, and carry on with no regard to the sounds spilling from their facehole, robs them of their power.  This is how you deal with narcissists.  You simply beat them them in court or on the ground in battle.",90cd7655d476ad61fade2fd50fc9946e43f869ac,True,False,,,,,0,1653956925,,0,{},ialujpa,False,t3_v19cn2,False,True,t1_ialrxlo,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v19cn2/thread_on_us_mlrs_headed_to_ukr_can_reload_4/ialujpa/,1653956942,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653928125.0,

They were reactions to different parts of your comment (the first one was a reaction to ""After a decade of failure to meet their required annual financial commitment of 2% GDP to the NATO alliance, I guess no one should really be surprised that their other commitments were not met either"" and the second paragraph was an reaction to ""If the tables were turned and Germany was being invaded by Russians, how do you think they would react to Ukraine “sitting this one out”?""). I didn't quoted your specific sentences, since I was on mobile.

Also, I was wrong about 2025. That one was only an estimate for France (https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_150041.htm?selectedLocale=en).. there seems to be no date when the countries should meet the 2% mark.. btw, they really should implement a date for that.

But yeah, we should step up our military spending, and if I would have anything to say about that we would already be at 2%.. but Scholz (or rather SPD) is the one who need to do that and I sadly don't have much influence over them. But hey, at least thats better than our last ruling party (CDU), so good job Germany, I guess...

This also goes for the rest of Europe (besides of the third which already is at 2%).

Besides of that we have the Problem, that our Military expenses just disappear into thin air because of mismanagement. We literally dumped like 135 Mil into a fucking trainings sail ship (Gorch Fock). The original estimate for that was 10 Mil. Additionally the company which accepted the money for the refitting went bankrupt while doing that?.. Yeah I have no fucking clue what happened there. But we really need to get these Problems under control. Otherwise it won't matter how much money we spend on military.

Bottom line: Germany has a lot of issues in the Military Sector and most of them can be traced back to mismanagement and our current ruling party/chancellor. Additionally we have mismanaged our energy politic to the point, where we can't really pull out of the Gas thingy with Russia. The 2% GDP are the least of our issues and at least the NATO as a whole isn't really that dependent on these 2% for now, because the US just throws absurd sums at their military and can probably steamroll every country on earth besides of maybe china.",932f67896a126fb3abde395390d2f959d0bd917a,True,False,,,,,0,1653956840,,0,{},ialudid,False,t3_v0wubz,False,True,t1_ialkuu5,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v0wubz/nato_is_no_longer_bound_by_commitments_to_russia/ialudid/,1653956852,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653928040.0,
