Russian forces are increasingly focused on advancing on Slovyansk from the southeast of Izyum and west of Lyman.

Russian forces are making gains within and around Severodonetsk.

Russian forces are likely hoping to advance on Lysychansk from Toshkivka in order to avoid having to fight across the Severskyi Donets River from Severodonetsk.

The Russian grouping in Kherson Oblast is likely feeling the pressure of the limited Ukrainian counteroffensive in northwestern Kherson Oblast, especially as much of the Russian operational focus is currently on the capture of Severodonetsk.",833dbd72c90d024a44d37a937d4cbb1c20bc7a36,True,False,,,,,0,1654040664,,0,{},iaq2scc,False,t3_v1omg9,False,False,t3_v1omg9,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v1omg9/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_31_2022/iaq2scc/,1654040681,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654011864.0,

Systems fight wars. The performance of the Russian systems, from vehicle design, to maintenance, to food logistics, to “force preservation” (reconstituting units to be fed back into the fire) has been atrocious. Total lack of air ground coordination, air defence failure, convoy snarls, a failed march on the capital. At all points, their systems have failed them badly, bogging them down into “old-school” war.

So that pretty much means any time an armed fighter is authorized to use lethal force. And in Iraq and Afghanistan, that was pretty much all the time. In WW2, it was pretty much constrained to the front. Outside the front, there was not a lot of fighting - if any. 

Just because you are in combat it doesn't mean you are taking fire. The no-fly zone missions during the 90s over Iraq where thousands of sorties were flew is considered a combat mission by the military. Even though most missions were boring. The reason is that the pilots flying those missions were putting their lives in danger and were authorized to use deadly force. 

There is a difference between the intensity of fighting. Obviously, Iraq and Afghanistan had a lot lower intensity fighting. Storming the beaches of Normandy is definitely different than getting snipped at while taking a shit. But both are dangerous and both require high levels of alertness. 

But when looking at mental health and impacts on soldiers, the question becomes this, what is worse? A short, very intense fight or a prolonged low intensity fight. I don't know the answer to that.

Politics abhors a vacuum even more than nature does and even though the number of high ranking military leaders and advisors continues to grow, there are plenty left.  They will defer to Putin until they no longer need to.  Whether that comes from external forces or internal ones is yet to be seen.

Rob Lee did mention that in the thread.  Despite their reputation, a lot of the testimony/videos showing atgm hits on T-series tanks knocks the tanks out, but the crew itself survives and evacuates.  Whereas even basic atgm hits on IFVs/APCs are often completely lethal.

So even with modern anti-tank measures, tanks do seem to be more survivable than lighter armor.

&gt;Here's how tanks can be replaced. For that 5-10 million dollars, you can have 50 sophisticated quad-copters for observation (roughly 1k each), with 5-10 running constant sorties. Then 50 or so attack quadhelicopters (roughly 1k each) with small missiles/grenades (less than 1lb) running constant sorties (mostly for AA). And then 10-20 ""heavy"" winged drones (probably 50 lbs total and 20k each) to deliver the heavy munitions (similar to a rpg) that could run 1-2 sorties constantly. Have this whole system run by 2-5 operators and 2-5 ground crew. Such a hypothetical system is not available and has not been developed. Is it technically possible? Probably, with a few billion dollars of engineering and some sophisticated image processing algorithms.

The reason is information to decision makers travels much better this way compared to 20-30 years ago. But I'm not sure. No aggressor goes into a conflict thinking they will not win. I don't think that has ever changed. It's just the internet made it much easier to measure up your enemy. 

The aspect of a tank is they make it easy to deliver around a 10lb explosive in a line of sight quite accurately out to about 3-5km. Without putting the crew in serious danger. They cost about 5-10 million dollars and they require a lot of logistics and support. There are cheaper ones but they have less capability. 

If that same capability can be replaced with drones, which I think it theoretically can, then I think tanks are obsolete.

The question becomes, if the above hypothetical system existed, why would you have tanks? The above is WAY more capable than a tank and would give your infantry or light armor way better support than any tank ever could. And it wouldn't be constrained by terrain. And it would have better observation capabilities. And you could use such a weapon for defense and offense. Because the problem with offense is locating your enemy, and the above system would be able to do that better tank. 

My thought is the only way heavy tanks remain relevant is they need better armor to protect against small explosives (less than 20lbs projectiles) so that bigger guns are needed to take them out (heavy aircraft or other tanks).

&gt; * Soon after his arrival, General Dvornikov tried to get disjointed air and land units to coordinate their attacks, American officials said. But he has not been seen in the past two weeks, leading some officials to speculate as to whether he remains in charge of the war effort.

&gt; * Russian pilots also continue to demonstrate the same risk-averse behavior they did in the early weeks of the war: darting across the border to launch strikes and then quickly returning to Russian territory, instead of staying in Ukrainian air space to deny access to their foes. The result is that Russia still has not established any kind of air superiority, officials said.

&gt; * The Russian military has made some progress in the east, where concentrated firepower and shortened supply lines have helped its forces fight intense battles in recent days. 

&gt; * President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine recently said that as many as 100 Ukrainian servicemen might be dying every day in the fighting.

&gt; * But the invasion is not “proceeding particularly differently in the east than in the west because they haven’t been able to change the character of the Russian army,” said Frederick W. Kagan, a senior fellow and director of the Critical Threats Project at the American Enterprise Institute. “There are some deep flaws in the Russian army that they could not have repaired in the last few weeks even if they had tried. The flaws are deep and fundamental.”

&gt; * But, General Breedlove added: “Even our army would be hard-pressed to refit, refurbish and reorganize in two weeks after having received such a sound whipping.” When General Dvornikov took control, “the force was thrust back into the battle too quickly. That decision had to have come from Moscow.”

&gt; * “We keep hearing accounts of Putin getting more involved,” said Ms. Farkas, who is now executive director of the McCain Institute. “We know that if you have presidents meddling in targeting and operational military decisions, it’s a recipe for disaster.”",0c9012d35fc7594595140b1eed2ff0d0d1bca814,True,False,,,,,0,1654034165,,0,{},iapoxfa,False,t3_v1omg9,False,True,t3_v1omg9,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v1omg9/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_31_2022/iapoxfa/,1654034178,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654005365.0,

It is functionally incapable of large scale maneuver warfare for a great many reasons, comm issues and logistics being the biggest, but there are many others.

I’m not sure what you mean by “institutionally prepared”. Almost every large scale training exercise involves a mass casualty event after a considerable ass whoopin’ from an adversary who has in depth knowledge of our capabilities and tactics. Every level of operations planning uses questions like “what is the worst possible thing the enemy could do to us” as the baseline. Russia clearly did not do the latter at the start of all this, and they didn’t even have unity of command until weeks into the war. 


I think this is an important article, and one should always be ready to challenge their own biases but I really don’t think ignoring Russian command failures is wise. Russia lost C2 the second the came under fire. They didn’t know where their units were, or what they were doing, or in some cases even if they were combat effective or even still actually obeying orders. 

People like to focus on big personnel and equipment losses but tbh that really is just a symptom of a bigger problem: Russian commanders had little to no effective contingency planning, had no idea of the readiness and effectiveness of their own forces, all while being extremely slow to adapt to changing battlefield conditions.

My only problem with his point of view is that tanks are still effective. That does not mean they will be effective in the next conflict. 

My argument is that we still have not seen the full capabilities of drone warfare as drone warfare is still in its infancy. Saying the tank is dead is premature. Saying drones won't make tanks obsolete is also premature. 

There is the possibility that automated drones can become so effective that they make tanks and even artillery ineffective. But that is a wild statement based upon assumptions in technology that has not been developed yet. So those weapons on the drawing board are still a long way from helping Russians or Ukrainians.

Wanna know why? This is all topmof my head and I am sure there might be counter arguments, but lets see

- Captured, tortured SOFs would be such a great diplomatic and propaganda win formrussia that it doesnt worth the risk. 

- SOF are not movie super heroes, they can be force multipliers yes, but tgey arent action heros. If you would ask a UAF general what they would like, more SOF operatives wouldnt be on the first 100 I think. (Think more about, ammo, weapons, intel on where to strike/where the russians are, long range artillery, long range ground to ground missles, drones, anti air ....). Special forces arent that effective in mostly front line combat then most people seems to think.

- SOF training and gear costs a lot, both money and time. That cost can be used better with above mentioned stuff, while no country would like to loose theirs. (Its like using your sport car for agricultural work, or the other way around, its just not something you would do unless you have no other options. They do.)

- What would they be used for? Their missionset? Night raids? UAF can do that with their SOF (and every other elements in this list I am sure).
Behind the line sabotage of military hardware? Assassination maybe? (to risky, use artillery if you can, maybe partisans, hoing through and back the front lines are not easy, all camps are guarded much more vigilantly now) Civilian infrastructure dmg? (Maybe the fires in Russia? But Secret service agents are much better for that)

Actually I thought the list would be longer, but I am tired so, I might be missing a bunch and still cant think of a reason that is nearly valod tondeploy special forces from NATO into this (unless they have Rambo, in which case he is already deployed and the russian vasulties are above 60k.

--------------

Thread: I completely disagree with this article's conclusions, and I think it stems from a misinterpretation of the data. Tanks, fighters, and ships are not ""being pushed into obsolescence"" and we are mostly seeing incremental changes in warfare.

If you are going to make a bold claim like ""we are seeing the very nature of combat change"" you need extraordinary evidence, which this article lacks. Instead, the successes and failures of the Russian and Ukrainian militaries can be explained by well-known principles of war. 2/

In Ukraine most casualties are coming from unguided artillery, Soviet-era air defenses are countering modernized Soviet-era aircraft, infantry are fighting infantry in trenches with rifles and grenades, tanks are being destroyed by AT mines, and most equipment is decades old. 3/

UCAVs and loitering munitions are playing a role, but they're not decisive and they aren't replacing manned aircraft or artillery. COTS UAVs are significant, but they are mostly being used to facilitate artillery, ISR for advancing units, and supporting existing capabilities. 4/

Russia has lost a lot of tanks in Ukraine but this is mostly a result of poor strategy and employment, not a deficiency of tanks themselves. We haven't learned much new about tanks from this war, except the well-know lesson that tanks are vulnerable without combined arms. 5/

Re: Oryx's figures, of the 741 recorded Russian tank losses, 306 (41%) were found abandoned by their crews. Many of the destroyed tanks on the list were also abandoned and destroyed by UA forces who could not capture them. &gt;50% of Russia's tank losses may have been abandoned. 6/

Those data do not indicate that tanks are obsolete, they indicate that tank units were poorly employed. Russia's invasion plan presumed little resistance, and its forces were not well-prepared to deal with resistance. Ground units focused on moving long distances too quickly. 7/

They did so by moving without proper support, such as artillery, EW, logistics, ISR, etc. and often did not move as cohesive BTGs. These units became rapidly overextended and were poorly positioned to handle resistance from the Ukrainian military or guerrilla tactics. 8/

The initial phase of Russia's invasion was not combined arms. The Air Force and Ground Forces fought separate campaigns and aviation didn't really support the ground advance. This left ground forces vulnerable. We should not try to draw sweeping lessons about warfare from this.9/

Tanks are vulnerable without combined arms support. This has been known for 100 years. Russia did not have enough infantry in this invasion and Russian tank regiments changed their T/O by reducing their motorized rifle battalions to a 75-man company. This was insufficient. 10/

How do you protect tanks from modern ATGM teams? You push UAVs and ground reconnaissance ahead of tank units and deploy sufficient infantry to protect tanks, particularly in urban areas. Russia didn't do this in the beginning, and tank units suffered as a result. 11/

VDV, motorized rifle, and spetsnaz units suffered similar problems at the beginning of the war. They made rapid dashes without combined arms support and sustained heavy casualties in many areas, including Hostomel, Bucha, Irpin, Sumy, Kharkiv, etc. 12/

There is ample evidence of the poor employment of tanks or tank units without sufficient infantry and other support that led to heavy losses. 13/

Russian units had little warning they were going to war, which is critical for logistics planning and ensuring proper maintenance. Many of Russia's tank losses happened in the 1st 2 weeks because of maintenance and logistics issues. Others got stuck. 14/

There was a particular issue with T-80 tanks because they didn't have enough gasoline for their gas turbine engines. Notably, Russia has adapted its TTPs and is fighting more competently in the Donbas and we are seeing fewer tank losses as a result. 15/

What is the alternative to tanks? Tanks are still important in urban warfare, counterattacks, exploiting success, and for supporting infantry assaulting well-defended and entrenched positions, which is what Russia is doing in the Donbas now with some success. 16/

Indeed, both Russia and Ukraine still clearly see the benefit of tanks and armor. Ukraine is asking for more armor, and they are using tanks in their counterattacks. They are likely using tanks to reinforce their defenses in the Donbas as well. 17/

People declared tanks were obsolete after the Nagorno-Karabakh war as well. But that was a misinterpretation of the data. Armenia lost a lot of tanks, but, imo, that showed that the side that loses its tanks will likely lose a ground war instead of showing they were obsolete. 18/

Tanks weren't Armenia's problem, its lack of air defenses to counter TB2 UCAVs was. People blamed the wrong system. Once Armenia lost those tanks or couldn't use them, Azerbaijan had success because Armenia couldn't reinforce its defenses with armor. 19/

Indeed, tanks were critical to Azerbaijan's success in penetrating Armenian defenses. It is no coincidence that Azerbaijan made its breakthrough in the south where the terrain was flatter and Azerbaijan could maximize its advantage in armor. 20/

No, this war does not show that tanks are obsolete, it shows that they need to be employed with proper support in a combined arms operation, which is part of US/NATO doctrine. It is true that Russia invaded with too many tanks, but tanks were still important in OIF 1. 21/

The Moskva was essentially an un-modernized 40+ year-old ship. It had very old air defenses (possibly non-functional), it didn't have modern CIWS comparable to US Navy's, it had conscript sailors, and it should have had newer ships providing close-range air defense for it. 22/

The loss of the Moskva was a blunder by the Russian Navy's leadership through complacency to the threat from Ukrainian anti-ship missiles. Such a large ship with old air defenses should not have been so close to the Ukrainian coast. It doesn't mean US Navy ships are obsolete. 23/

I think this part about aviation vs air defenses is wrong too. Ukraine has mostly Soviet-era S-300PT/PS, Buk-M1, and Osa air defenses (which are playing a bigger role and influencing Russian air ops more than than MANPADS). These aren't cheap systems but they are old. 24/

If Ukraine only had MANPADS, Russian aviation would be operating more effectively. Russian aircraft have changed their TTPs, putting them at greater risk to MANPADS, because they assess the threat from S-300 and Buk-M1 is greater and because of issues with targeting systems. 25/

This part isn't true. Russia is having success conducting air strikes in the Donbas because Ukraine can't afford to push valuable S-300 and Buk-M1 systems into the Donbas salient where they could be targeted by Russian artillery. MANPADS are not sufficient here. 26/",f8eb56410557e671e3ee4fcdd683c874bc612d19,True,False,,,,,0,1654032170,,0,{},iapkiqo,True,t3_v20eql,False,True,t3_v20eql,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v20eql/war_will_never_be_this_bulky_again_russias/iapkiqo/,1654032184,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654003370.0,

---------------

&gt; * Russia’s botched invasion and Ukraine’s remarkable fortitude in fighting back have illustrated the diminishing power of the heavy and expensive unit of military power, its role challenged by nimbler, easier-to-use—and, crucially, cheaper—systems. 

&gt; * Tanks, fighter jets, and warships are being pushed into obsolescence, giving way to new tools of conflict. In the process, we are seeing the very nature of combat change. In fact, we may be witnessing in Ukraine the final war of 20th-century militaries.

&gt; * What we have seen, however, is a tank massacre: Tallies of Russian tank losses range from 700 to 1,200, an enormous loss out of a total arsenal of perhaps 1,500 that took part in the initial invasion.

&gt; * This swing in favor of smaller and cheaper defensive weapons has been matched in the air.

&gt; * As the counterinsurgency expert T. X. Hammes has argued, the improvement of defensive firepower has made forward movement very difficult, changing the balance of modern warfare very much against the attacker.

&gt; * This has consequences around the world: If the Chinese were rash enough to attempt an amphibious assault on Taiwan, or the U.S. were rash enough to send large carrier battle groups to the Chinese coast in a battle over the South China Sea, the result would be the Moskva many times over.

&gt; * …political and military leaders will need to start conceiving of an entirely different battlefield, full of lighter, smaller, more mobile, and in many cases autonomous or remotely operated weapons. In essence, they will need to prepare for the first wars of the 21st century.

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"It depends on the infantry AT threat. People saying to use dismounted infantry to counter AT threat are half right.  That only refers to close range AT weapons in constructive terrain like urban, jungles, or while actively overrunning a defensive position, where AT teams can pop out of a hole to shoot, or more so maneuver in dead space to hunt and kill armor. Bringing dismounted infantry to fight to the flanks and rear, occasionally on point too, of the tanks and IFV allow them to often spot the hunter killer teams first or engage/assault them if they do fire, which often forces nearby enemy AT hunter killer teams to not fire for fear it'll be suicide. Outside of Mariupol, they were doing this inconsistently. 

Against an ATGM threat coupled with combined arms, pushing dismounted infantry out does nothing. The ATGM can fire from too far away for infantry to spot or engage them, and if dismounted infantry are out patrolling a full kilometer in front of friendly armor then the dismounts revert back to WW1 survivability, getting mowed down with ease by heavy weapons, including artillery, and small arms. Might as well not have tanks or IFV then.

To deal with dismounted ATGM, Russia should try to find them first. Push out more ISR to try to spot the defensive positions before they fire, that means drones and various recon missions.  Having drones overhead overwatching friendly movements are great for not only spotting enemy exposing themselves to fight but also deterring them if they think they're being watched. 

Dismounted enemy with AT weapons can't expose themselves to aim and fire them if they are suppressed. So, the attacker needs to figure out how to suppress them. Harassment and Interdiction fires of random locations with arty and mortars, and heavy suppression of all suspected defensive positions with arty and AFV weaponry (fun fact, that's why IFV have rapid firing light cannons instead of slow firing heavy cannons).

Also, Russia could take notes from NATO and try to hide the thermal signatures of their AFV, which is how the most effective ATGMs find and track them. They can also include more obscuration missiles, especially using white phosphorus (which burns) to hide their heat signatures. 

They can also not attack areas the UA know they are attacking. Sounds easy but when Putin tells the world that Russia is going to focus on the Donbas, and then intelligence picks up movement of two dozen BTGs moving to one specific area of operations, and the weather is still shitty enough that they're still largely road bound for the beginning, it's not exactly hard to figure out where to position a couple guys with the Javelin.

I definitely don't think this is true at all. 

Nobody with military experience that was well trained during their service needs to be a veteran of a fully mechanized high intensity conventional war that they understood at all levels to know that the Russians have performed horribly in this war, anymore than someone needs to get shot with a rifle to know it's painful. 

The river crossing debacle didn't happen in a bubble, it was just another instance of Russia doing something disastrous in this war. That is the issue, hardly anyone is going to give credit when credit is do, pull an ""in an fairness"" to defend Russia performing a high risk operation, when they've done so many monumentally and truly unbelievably stupid things already. 

I agree that the river crossing story was badly reported on, but, let's be frank, it has sucked throughout the whole war. ""Anyone following this story using only main stream media sources are shockingly clueless"" isn't a quote that only applies to this war either. That's normal. 

Just because the media is reporting on something doesn't mean it's true. Just because retired generals shit talking the Russians aren't looking at the minutia (which hadn't been their jobs since they were lieutenants), that isn't indicative of an unconscious conspiracy to cover up bad doctrine.

At some level, we don't know. The S-400 have not been tried in combat.

On the other hand, zoom out a bit, and the history of air defenses is just not good.

Truly layered air defense is not a new concept; in fact, every attempt at going for air defenses in modern warfare have seen layered air defenses. So let's look at two examples. 1991 Gulf War and 1982's Mole Cricket 19.

In both operations, the defenders have an extremely layered air defenses. In 1991, Iraqi formations were absolutely crawling with SHORAD and MANPADS. The Iraqis had upwards of 1000 SHORAD launchers and over 10,000 MANPADS. Most of it wasn't exactly new, but they were new enough. Most were supplied by Soviets in 1980, and represented the state of the art in 1980.

In 1982, the Syrians had latest Soviet systems, and yes, they had it layered. Short ranged, long ranged, MANPADS (the battle took place too high to have the MANPADS matter, but sure, they existed), and even a large number of Syrian fighters on their own.

In both cases, Soviet advisors played a hands-on role. We can talk competence of the crews involved, but actual Russian crews do plenty of dumb shits too (see: 2022 war). In both cases, the air defenses go picked apart with minimal losses.

I am not sure what you think the Iraqis and Syrians were missing in the two battles, but layering was not the problem.",9c3a75cffab747cfae90219fec6fe3b9950a0c2f,True,False,,,,,0,1654028663,,0,{},iapchac,False,t3_v1tu0r,False,True,t1_iapao25,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v1tu0r/would_we_do_better_hubris_and_validation_in/iapchac/,1654028675,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653999863.0,

Aka, saying Russia or China without saying it. 

The issue was each DOD branch was getting caught up with other missions that many within didn't like doing and wanted to revert back to their heyday of the Cold War era. The USAF was unsure of its future especially, a return to focusing on air power versus Russia or China was a hell of a lot safer future for security and funding than a focus on insurgents or rogue nations with third world military capabilities; they could still do the latter while focusing on the former. So they sold that idea appealing to Near Peer threats that made it imperative they get maximum funding. 

Within the Army too they'd been stuck doing regular peacekeeping deployments in the 90s and then COIN shit from 2002 onwards and many HATED it. Those sorts wanted to return to the good old days of prepping to fight the Russkies, but obviously there wasn't a threat that warranted it until Cold War 2.0 rekindled in 2014, at which point they ditched COIN despite still deploying to both Afghanistan and Iraq.

I totally agree with your point about Ukrainian familiarity with Russia, but just wanted to nitpick the ""one country for 1000 years"" part...

Most of western and central Ukraine (including Kyiv), and Belarus, was part of Lithuania or Poland for centuries (roughly 1320 - 1667, and most of the west until 1795). The southern steppe and Crimea wasn't controlled by any Slavic power until Russia defeated the Crimean Tatars in the late 17th century. The two countries who have truly been together for 1000 years are actually Ukraine and Belarus.

I'm only correcting this because I think it's important to break down the common idea that this big Russia we're familiar with is some thousand year old phenomenon that Ukraine and Belarus have practically always been a part of. I'm sure Putin believes so, but it's not correct.

As I said though, *you're still absolutely right that Ukrainians are intimately familiar with Russia*, and that is quite relevant for this war. What I find noticeable is that all the nations familiar with Russia are willing to stand up to it and do not overestimate its power, while we in the West tend to mystify and overestimate Russian power.",4dd2f385962f05acc31500ecd66b014b9bf9bba5,True,False,,,,,0,1654024571,,0,{},iap3r5k,False,t3_v1tu0r,False,True,t1_iaosq13,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v1tu0r/would_we_do_better_hubris_and_validation_in/iap3r5k/,1654024693,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653995771.0,

This is very poor reasoning.

Remember that account from one of the Finnish volunteers? He talked about how the Fin regiment or whatever you want to call it was assigned to a camp where the UA commander had everyone organized in a tidy little tent grid in an open field. The Fins didn't like the idea of that, so they spent the night in foxholes in the woods, much to the bemusement of the Ukrainian forces. And then a missile attack happened on a similar camp in a different location, and suddenly people are thinking maybe those Fins had the right idea after all.

So you have an anecdotal narrative that you've generalized into proof that Ukraine and Russia have some sort of new generation of warfare that ""The West"" is ignorant of.

And I have one that makes it seem like the average Finnish grunt is much more savvy about this war than Ukraine's command.

I just wish the west could be fully united behind how dangerous this was. I. Can’t believe we didn’t wake up after Crimea.

We could have woken up to shrill media cries of a “Soviet Union 2.0”. The victory articles that leaked were celebrating the heralding of a union state of Belarus and Ukraine with Russia.

The OMON riot police and rosvgardia were sent in and basically the screws were going to be tightened on the new vassal, ands they would then cement these gains to create that centralised union with the power in Moscow.

This would make them directly connected to Moldova via transnistria. I wouldn’t speculate on how exactly they’d bring it into the fold, from just pushing the troops onwards or flooding Moldova with. Billions in covert operations like they did Ukraine or soft power. Either way they could have then taken Moldova very quickly off they close force.

After that staging referendums on Abkhazia and South Ossetia joining Russia would have been a cherry on top and very easy.

They would be in prime position to basically force Georgia into the union afterwards in just a space of a couple of months. And would they want a repeat of 2008, especially if they just witnessed the relentless bombing of civilian areas and the lightning fast fall of Ukraine if it had called in a week or two?

This could have all happened faster than European leaders knew what to do, plus if Russia was winning like this and then proceeded to manipulate the grain supply and also threaten strategically to cut off gas, do we really think we’d have the Germans and Hungarians on board it the fighting was over?? There’s be a lot of talk but so much blame and finger pointing and eventual shame and embarrassment and reluctant acceptance of the status quo.


The fact that Ukraine not on my fought hard but managed to inflict heavy losses on Russia and is bleeding by the day while bleeding the Russians and has imdesroyed thousands of their modern vehicles is something we owe them an eternal debt for.

It will simply never be this cheap to keep the Russians at bat and prevent a total catastrophe for Europe. Imagine how much repression and evil putin would have done in the newly conquered areas to prevent them not being solidified as gains. We already know assassinations we’re planned and huge cracking down etc:


He’d be laughing to the bank and relishing in his new legacy. Doesn’t matter it would be a doomed union, because of corruption, his destruction of all institutions and the fact it’s not held together by any ideals just the personalised rule of a Moscow elite and ethnic nationalist revanchism and people would have no future to hope for just stagnation. But he would learn from the downfall of the USSR, look how many intelligence agencies he has created in Russia with overlapping responsibilities to try prevent a coup. Also personalised power in Chechnya, he even has some Chechens staying in Moscow. He even has a couple of tank units that have been stationed near Moscow and are at the ready and have been vetted  in case any kind of coup came into action.


If he managed to do all this and then started conscripting young people from Moldova, Ukraine, Belarus, Georgian Russian areas to gradually build up a bigger army while taking advantage of the fact that fighting is over and if Europe tries to stop him he can just threaten gas to be cutoff, who would stop him?

It would be far more expensive to deal with.. it would have been something that would have occupied our struggles for a generation, because there’s people even more radical than putin that would love to preserve these gains.

Imagine how much even worse it could get, imagine if he could find away to fracture NATO, then start demanding the Russian areas of the Baltic countries as “concessions”. Putinism is never satisfied, all that propaganda about “NATO expansion is just to oppose the fact it stops imperial ambitions” if putin had close to the power of NATO he would actually treat it as an empire, as he currently does Russia.. he’d never stop trying to grab more and solidify “spheres of influence”. 

He has been saying so much of this, while other Russian domestic voices have spoken about their ambitions abroad but we don’t believe it.

Why? Can you back this position up without an appeal to the (obvious) morality of your stance? 

The reason I ask this is not to disregard the suffering, hardship, and devastation of Ukraine; rather, morality is not a particularly *useful* lens to view the actions of nations (both internationally and domestically mind you). There are a great many schools of thought on international relations, but very few rely on notions of what is ""right"" or ""wrong"" - rather, we typically tend to discuss things in terms of ""interest."" 

Is this because we are cold, cruel individuals? Of course not! It is simply because nations do not have a strong track record of behaving in a moral action nor does morality appear to be a good explanatory variable in the actions of nations. Consider: would you expect, absent intense pressure, a corporation to act morally? I don't think so - hence the vast array of laws and social expectations created by citizens and shareholders to restrict, constrain, and pressure companies to behave in accordance of our moral boundaries (and I should add we see these fail *regularly).* 

Nations are *far more powerful* than any corporation and there are extremely limited means by which we can constrain, restrict, or pressure them to behave in a moral fashion (ask the Uyghurs). Democracies have a *tendency* to pressure towards a more morale or just world, but again a cursory look at history will show that the people are not always correct, nor does this always translate into moral outcomes (see: Vietnam, Iraq, Yugoslav Wars, etc.). 

For this reason, we endeavour to avoid morality in our discourse, simply because it is not particularly *useful* as an explanatory factor for the actions of nations.",350ff9ea4dd4419f0d840d01086c46d9f24fb39e,True,False,,,,,0,1654019874,,0,{},iaotcr1,False,t3_v1omg9,False,True,t1_iaomlwo,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v1omg9/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_31_2022/iaotcr1/,1654019888,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653991074.0,
[],False,,OhSillyDays,,,[],,,,text,t2_h1c0qtwi,False,False,"&gt; However, the air supremacy and the general disparity is part of the excellence of the US military. The point the author makes here; the Russian army is operating less well than the US army because it lacks air supremacy and is not fighting against an outmatched enemy. However, the entire reason the US had air supremacy and was fighting against an outmatched enemy, was because the excellence of US operations compared to the Russian one on land and air that achieved this status. As such, this would show the ability of the US military to achieve overwhelmingly favorable battle conditions by sticking to its doctrine, even when this is not necessarily a given. For example; could Russia, if its military had been more competent, really not have gained air supremacy against Ukraine, like the US did versus Iraq?

This is a really interesting concept and I think it misses a huge aspect to warfare.

Warfare always turns into a war of attrition. That means that risky behavior is slowly reduced on both sides and attrition becomes the major factor.

Death rates are of course important. They tell you what your ability is to maintain a fight. Additionally, casualty rates tell the force strength is and will help determine a the force's morale. 

What is more important than the death rate is two things, the grit and the risk behavior of a force. Grit being the capability to keep fighting after forces have taken heavy loses and the ability to perform risky behavior for gains. In terms of the US military in Afghanistan and Iraq, both were really low, but they also had local forces that had very high grit and risk taking ability. However, in Afghanistan, it seems like morale was very low in the ANA and they used the US coalition forces as backdrop to hold themselves up. When the US left, their morale plummeted and the forces more or less disbanded. 

Interestingly, I think the Russian forces are probably some of the best in the world with grit and doing risky behavior. I think it has to do with their ability to treat their soldiers like maggots, so the maggots will do anything because they are already dead inside. All kinds of fucked up. 

But if we take out the death rate and see how capable a military is, you have to look at adaptation. How good is the military at adapting to the changing battlefield. And that is probably the best measure of a military in a long conflict.

What we saw in Iraq and Afghanistan were militaries able to adapt. And US coalition forces adapted really well to the challenges at hand. They couldn't take major losses, so they made up for those losses by using local forces. They also used their advantages, mainly air power, to give themselves a huge force multiplier. Would US soldiers be willing to put themselves in risky situations? I have no doubt that if the need arose, US coalition forces in both Iraq and Afghanistan would have put themselves in harm to achieve their objectives. I also know that dead US soldiers is bad press, so the brass was very sensitive to dead soldiers and adapted their tactics to reduce the risk of fighters. 

Looking at the above, I don't think any of that is any indication that US forces are weak or less capable. It just tells me that they had different risk tolerances in those conflicts.

Change the battlefield and put US forces in Taiwan defending against China, and I have no doubt that US forces would continue to fight having similar casualty rates as Russia. Even if they lost air superiority or were even forced to fight behind the lines. Whether they would be successful is a very open ended question. The reason is the risk tolerance and grit of the US would be much higher to defend Taiwan than Iraqis or Afghanis. Is it racist and fucked up? Yeah, probably. That's the realities of the battlefield though.",d0a4652671c2de6b5b4c8c164f8ce10634fba679,True,False,,,,,0,1654019870,,0,{},iaotcep,False,t3_v1tu0r,False,False,t1_iaoj7ed,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v1tu0r/would_we_do_better_hubris_and_validation_in/iaotcep/,1654019888,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653991070.0,

What's given you that impression? The official Indian stance has hoped for an end to the conflict and for it to be resolved through peaceful means. 

The general public sentiment in the country is sympathetic towards the Ukrainian civilians but is generally cognisant of why our state has acted in the manner it has. 

&gt;I would hope no one around here is going to deny American Cold War hypocrisy.

It's quite futile to discuss hypocrisy in IR - I've been involved in such discussions before and they always devolve into a 'you did it' game until either sides go back hundreds of years into history. It's why I prefer to leave out a strong moral component when evaluating such issues - such components are usually only used as a cover for strategic moves. 

&gt;Are these realpoliticking Indians hoping for Russia to deploy more battlefleets on their behalf

Interesting you would say that - the Soviets did indeed help India in 1971 by dispatching groups of destroyers and cruisers along with a nuclear warhead-tipped submarine which trailed the USS Enterprise as it entered the Bay of Bengal. 

Clearly, the Soviets were quite wiling to help the Indians out at that point of time. 

I don't think the modern Russian state is up for such projections of power - however I don't think something as dramatic is required by a WMD-armed India either. 

You may choose to call such incidents 'sour grapes' but look at how the Americans reacted during the Cuban Missile Crisis and their consequent treatment of Cuba.

Introduction:

&gt; It is now widely understood that many observers, in advance of this war, over-estimated Russian military performance and underestimated Ukrainian military performance.

No enemy incoming tube arty but rocket arty from Katuysha was frequent, though that was very inaccurate and often only a handful of rockets, not extended barrages. Mortars varied in accuracy, sometimes they were aimed only to get inside a very large FOB (4 sqkm) while other times they could be very accurate. Those rarely fired more than a handful because our counterbattery was excellent, and our enemy wanted to live to fight another day, though there were some battles where numerous mortars were firing on one target for an extended period. 

When it comes to arty specifically, which is more lethal and effective?  Area fire with a standard sheaf or PGM arty like Excalibur used against identified point targets accurate to 10 meters? Most would say there are reasons to call in the former but the latter is more destructive because it's more precise, able to maximize damage by having the arty round land on or very close to a target before detonating. You know what that sounds like?

An IED 

Actually an artillery shell rigged IED is more accurate than Excalibur because the latter only has a CEP of 10 meters, whereas any insurgent triggerman detonating their IED even against a fast moving vehicle that can't do better than 10 meters absolutely sucks. 

Let's say you're in a covered fighting position inside a football field sized area that takes a battery fire for effect fire mission from 152mm artillery rounds. That's scary, but you're probably going to be okay as long as you're not exposed, WW1 proved that. That's what overhead cover is for and why dugouts exist. 

Now picture being in a flat bottomed lightly armored vehicle that drives over a hole in the ground filled with 8x 152mm artillery rounds that all detonate together. That happened to a vehicle in my company in Iraq, the insides of that Stryker looked like God took a can opener to it. American troops in the back ripped to pieces. Many dead and the living were all missing at least 1x limb. And that was a normal day in Iraq.

No, Americans did not typically take incoming arty during the occupation phases of the GWOT, unless taking friendly fire which happened far too regularly. When we did take indirect fire it was silent mortars or loud MLRS rocket, often daily but never in heavy concentrations thankfully.

&gt;Common folks can have all kind of reasons to support genocide and a well spoken Hitler of our era

I suppose your are privy as to why there is support for Russia and its alleged genocide in the subcontinent? Please elaborate. 

The editorials I have read, panels I've attended and people I have interacted with have all suggested a similar line of reasoning. Across the political spectrum. 

I would like to see what your claim about the support for said 'genocide' is. It's a pretty insane claim to begin with - it presumes that there is a proven genocide happening and that the masses in the subcontinent are aware of it. 

&gt;how some Indian freedom fighters like Subhash Chandra Bose and Indian National Army fully supported Hitler although they may have known about his racialist views and gas chambers for Jews.

Wrong - the gas chambers' existence was only known to the world at large in 1945. There is no evidence that Bose was directly aware of this. 

Of course, he was aware of Nazi atrocities towards the Jews and he had expressed absolute contempt for it. 

However, I suppose he had a right to be more contemptuous of the British who had engineered famines in India (killing tens of millions) and conducted massacres like the one in Jallianwala Bagh. 

&gt;India will squarely fall on the western camp, not Russia/China.

Let's not let our imagination run too wild and portend the plot of the next COD game - I will agree to you to the extent that India will be positioned against the Chinese in the next big conflict in Asia - however that would entirely be due to reasons of realpolitik and not morality. 

In a much longer time period, it's quite possible that western countries could attempt to balance India in the region - similar to what they've attempted with China.",42414e9a44dcdad8ee9a688cb6623f7d19b82d76,True,False,,,,,0,1654017875,,0,{},iaookix,False,t3_v15y72,False,True,t1_iaom8bz,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v15y72/risks_of_nuclear_escalation_after_the_end_of_war/iaookix/,1654017887,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653989075.0,

So we can only assume what a war between more equal peers would look like, e.g. between China and Australia, Israel and Iran or North Korea and Japan.

One thing I disagree with the author though about is that the US has not fought in similar circumstances, and that it is thus hard to gauge. The author says that ''The United States and many of its NATO allies are veterans of Afghanistan, and the U.S. and British militaries saw extensive service in Iraq. However, Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm and Operation Iraqi Freedom, the last large-scale U.S. combat operations, were against opponents who were vastly overmatched and occurred in an environment where the United States enjoyed air supremacy and total sea control.''

However, the air supremacy and the general disparity is part of the excellence of the US military. The point the author makes here; the Russian army is operating less well than the US army because it lacks air supremacy and is not fighting against an outmatched enemy. However, the entire reason the US had air supremacy and was fighting against an outmatched enemy, was because the excellence of US operations compared to the Russian one on land and air that achieved this status . For example; could Russia, if its military had been more competent, really not have gained air supremacy against Ukraine, like the US did versus Iraq?

All this can be done with money once Putin is gone, we're talking about Russia here after all. Before Putin it was a Mafia state, then it became an Oligarchy, and then it become a dictatorship. Using the corruption in place in every dimension of Russia to introduce progressive reforms is, if Putin is gone, theoretically not that difficult. In practice, it's not easy at all but at least it seems like the least difficult and costly way to go about steering Russia towards the right way.



That should not justify use of nuclear weapons as per their nuclear doctrine at least.

I enjoyed this article as it challenges many of the assumptions and accepted conclusions about this war in thought provoking ways, with excellent examples and reasoning. 

If you are interested in the military lessons of the war in Ukraine, the personnel issues, the tactics of surprise, or the future of warfare, then you should consider taking the time to read it. 

-----------------

&gt; * What if, however, the analysts are seeing the lessons from Ukraine incorrectly, through lenses refracted by their own biases and hubris? What if the key variable is not the professionalism of the Russian military, but the nature of this war?

&gt; * As we shall see, U.S. and Russian doctrines are similar for a river crossing operation and many other types of tactical and operational maneuvers. If Russia’s failure is attributable to personnel failures, then the war does not challenge current U.S. warfighting concepts and capabilities — if they are wielded by professionals. If the problem is not personnel, then U.S. approaches could be invalidated. Hence, the question: Would U.S forces do better in a war like Ukraine?

&gt; * One should not, however, forget that Ukraine is not the Baltics. Ukraine has strategic depth and substantial military forces, who have been reorganizing and training under NATO supervision since the 2014 Russian invasion. They are also receiving massive and largely unimpeded materiel support from the West.

&gt; * It is hard to argue with the symptoms of Russian performance, but what if the diagnosis is wrong? What if Western militaries share a similar malady, but are failing to see it because of superficial assessments of the Russians?

&gt; * The Russians have, however, conducted several successful river crossings of the Siverskyi Donets River to position forces for offensive operations against Izyum. These crossings enabled the Russians to posture forces for offensive operations in the region south of the river.

&gt; * These crossings, as well as other successful Russian operations, receive scant media attention. 

&gt; * What is comforting about blaming the Russian failures on their practice, rather than their doctrine, is that it relieves Western militaries of any requirement to thoroughly examine their own doctrine. This is important because, as the various articles note, the doctrine for a river crossing operation is similar across militaries.

&gt; * The river-crossing story highlights the real ailment afflicting both the Russians and their Western observers: chronic inexperience in offensive combat against a competent adversary that is able, in today’s description, to contest all domains in a protracted war that generates high numbers of casualties. 

&gt; * The current war appears to be evolving into a protracted war of attrition. Therefore, the Russian strategy of limited maneuver and a heavy reliance on fires may yet be sound. They seem to be learning, as Russia analyst Michael Kofman pointed out in a recent War on the Rocks podcast. This protraction of major combat operations is also beyond the experience of serving Western officers.

&gt; * …if the numbers being reported by each combatant are in the ballpark, then these running estimates show both sides are suffering significant levels of attrition, most importantly in personnel.

&gt; * Western militaries are also conditioned by what Jeffrey Record calls “casualty phobia.”

&gt; * His thesis is that U.S. policymakers and senior military officers believe that the “use of force in situations of optional intervention should be prepared to sacrifice even operational effectiveness for the sake of casualty avoidance” and that in the war against Serbia, “force protection was accorded priority over mission accomplishment.”

&gt; * In over 20 years of war in Afghanistan, not a single platoon position was lost in combat. Casualty levels were extraordinarily low by even Vietnam War standards and medical attention was prompt and comprehensive. 

&gt; * The war in Ukraine has starkly demonstrated the high human costs of large-scale, high-intensity warfare.

&gt; * Changing the mindset from “force protection” to “force preservation” borders on heresy in current Western military culture. 

&gt; * In Ukraine, Russia is learning the necessity of force preservation the hard way — in the unforgiving crucible of combat.

&gt; * The fact that the Russians are reconstituting units from fresh troops and remnants of units decimated in combat is the reality of protracted, high-intensity combat. 

&gt; * Importantly, these levels of casualties in the Ukraine war also call into question the ability of Western armies to maintain adequate fighting strength in other than short wars with modest casualties. 

&gt; * This new reality essentially means that there is nowhere for a relatively large formation to hide. Surprise, particularly at a limited number of potential crossing points on a river, may not be possible.

&gt; * This new reality renders those criticizing the Russians not only wrong but dangerous. They are clinging to a doctrine that may be completely outdated in the current operational environment. That they persist in the view that Russian incompetence is mostly due to untrained and poorly motivated soldiers, led by corrupt and incompetent leaders, gives them a comfortable answer that does not invalidate their expertise or current practices.

&gt; * “I think we’re overly centralized, overly bureaucratic, and overly risk averse, which is the opposite of what we’re going to need in any type of warfare.”

&gt; * Perhaps enough people, materiel, and an indomitable will to fight despite privations and setbacks are exactly what are really necessary to endure and win in peer warfare.

&gt; * This leads to the second danger: hubris. The unspoken implication of the Western analysis is that we would do better than the Russians because we are better than them. Are we?

&gt; * Consequently, a deeply entrenched Soviet-style bureaucracy and training model permeated the Ukrainian military.   …many of the tactics above the small unit look more Russian than American, as does most of the equipment.

&gt; * …the analysis of the Ukraine war needs to address another unasked question: What if this view that quality people and leaders are the most important ingredient in modern warfare is wrong? What if Stalin was correct that quantity has a quality all of its own? If that is the case, then the Ukrainians may need much greater assistance if they are to survive a Russian-style grinding war of attrition.

&gt; * …as the United States plans for how it will compete and potentially fight China and Russia in the future, the approach should be characterized by humility and an intense desire to challenge existing assumptions, concepts, and capabilities, rather than to validate current approaches.

It really depends when, again, the entire narrative of the outbreak of WW2 ignores a lot of history. Of particular importance were the German-Polish negotiations held from October 1938 to March 1939. These talks disprove the notion that Hitler's war was long planned (this is even more a ridiculous notion given that the Wehrmacht had no official plan for a war with Poland until Hitler ordered them to in April 3rd 1939).

In particular Asian countries are incredibly xenophobic, often not even assimilating people from neighboring countries let alone migrants or refugees from developing countries.

A lot of the focus since the war began has been on gas but oil is actually a much more significant export for Russia. In 2021 Russia energy sales to the EU totalled $117b, of this gas made up $22b, oil products made up around $87b. The EU sanctions should see oil exports drop by 90% by the end of the year reducing overall Russian energy imports by a 65% and this excludes separate reductions to gas purchases which will push that number higher.

Yes energy price spikes have helped Russia in the short term, but in the medium to long term this is devastating to Russia and further highlights the scale of Putin's strategic blunder.

Genuinely believe that the goal of US/UK/Germany for a long time, has been the balkanisation of Russia. Putin pretty much openly said this in his initial Ukraine ""special operation"" war speech and notice that nobody denied his claims about what he was told.

Balkanisation of Russia also plays into especially the actions of NATO post cold-war and especially NATO, Germany, US and UK's reaction to the ""Common European Home"" and OSCE.

--------------------------------

Slightly off topic. 

So one of my mum's friends runs language schools for refugees in ireland. They've obviously got a huge influx of ukrainians so she's been overloaded getting them all set up with english classes.

She is NOT. ALLOWED. to use the extra classes for afghan/syrian/iraqi refugees despite many of them being in the system for years, meaning it's actual policy at this point to keep 'the browns' in a state of limbo rather than helping them settle/integrate. She's on the verge of quitting because morally she just can't keep doing it. The preferential treatment is just too immoral. It's made worse by the fact that she's indian and experienced shitloads of racism when she first moved to ireland.

The racism of european refugee policies is honestly disgusting

I also have a friend in the UK who is housing a UA refugee lady, and the comparison between the refugee process and experience and that of 'the browns' is again disgusting. She spent a couple of weeks couch-surfing in poland filling in (admittedly shitty) forms before being transferred to the UK, given a home/family to live with and being granted *full refugee status* including the right to work. She's been there for a month and already has two internships and is looking forward to a productive and hopefully peaceful future.

Compare that to an Iraqi interpreter who worked for the british and had to flee for their lives. An who the government *publicly claim* has the right to seek asylum in the UK, and who the british public massively support being granted asylum in the UK.

- Have to trek thousands of miles on an extremely long and dangerous journey.

- Spend months living in squalor in Calais trying to find away to cross the channel

- arrive only to be sent to a 'detention centre' (See: prison) where they can be held *indefinitely* in conditions that quite literally [breach their human rights](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/apr/14/priti-patels-detention-policies-found-to-breach-human-rights-rules). That's *if you're lucky*. If you're unlucky they shove you onto a deportation flight and illegally fly you out of the country before 'those pesky human rights lawyers' have the chance to actually ensure your legal rights are upheld. Or they ship you off to fucking rwanda as of recently.

- If lucky complete an asylum application which is designed to reject candidates and requires information that's impossible to obtain (this also applies to UA applications in many cases in fairness)

- Have to wait months or years whilst said application is assessed, during which time you can't work or take part in society.

- Majority of applications are rejected.... despite the majority of those rejected being overturned on appeal.

- Appeals process is long and laborious and requires legal assistance which is not provided except by charities working pro-bono.

- Even if by some miracle everything works out you're demonised as an 'economic migrant' anyway, with daily hit pieces in the media attacking your very existence.

It just goes on and on. To say that the comparative experiences are night and day is an understatement. I would say I hope that this is a turning point in refugee policy, but we all know it won't be.",dcedf70e81377982e5b5ac8bc43db30ac7a8ed22,True,False,,,,,0,1653987985,,0,{},ian5hkg,False,t3_v0ymyc,False,True,t3_v0ymyc,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v0ymyc/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_30_2022/ian5hkg/,1653987997,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653959185.0,

Quite a bit even when Russia has stopped reporting figures to hide the damage.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;VAT receipts, which reflect consumer spending, fell 54% in April year on year, the Kommersant daily said, citing preliminary finance ministry data.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Russia has stopped publishing most data on financial flows, but figures compiled by the Bank of Finland based on local customs data show imports have plunged - and not just from the West.  
  
Chinese exports to Russia were down by a quarter in April and shipments from Vietnam, South Korea, Malaysia and Taiwan more than halved, the bank said.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;But inflation is still at its highest in two decades at more than 17%. That means a 10% hike in pensions and the minimum wage announced by Putin still leaves many facing a cut in household incomes in real terms.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""The real pain has not started yet as some exiting companies are still paying wages and some companies continue production using their inventories of imported parts,"" said Guriev, who is also a former chief economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.  
  
Morgan Stanley economists see a 13% drop in household consumption in 2022 and a 23% fall in investment. The bank's chief regional economist, Alina Slyusarchuk, said in a note that Russia's potential long-term growth rate was now just 1%.

Key Takeaways

Russian forces continued to incrementally capture areas of Severodonetsk but have not yet fully encircled the city.

Russian forces focused on regrouping near Izyum to renew offensives towards Slovyansk and Barvinkove and conducted only minor, unsuccessful, attacks. Russian forces are making incremental advances towards Slovyansk and seek to assault the city itself in the coming weeks, but are unlikely to achieve decisive gains.

Russian forces in Kharkiv continue to focus efforts on preventing a Ukrainian counteroffensive from reaching the international border between Kharkiv and Belgorod, and Ukrainian forces have not conducted any significant operations in the area in recent days.

The limited Ukrainian counterattack in northern Kherson Oblast did not take any further ground in the last 48 hours but has disrupted Russian operations. Russian forces launched several unsuccessful attacks against the Ukrainian bridgehead on the east bank of the Inhulets River.

1. Historical precedents might be useful to some extent (e.g. ground forces) but are probably only passingly relevant to the informationized modern battlefields. In a modern peer conflict you’re going to need a lot more than esprit de corps to keep a fighter jet fueled or a radar station from getting bombed.

2. One thing that the war on terror has given is a very strong ground attack capability for close air support in western air forces, which the Ukraine conflict shows is something that Russia hasn’t managed to achieve even despite their efforts in Syria. That sort of coordination is difficult to develop and shows that we have benefited from fighting wars. As for material and financial degradation I have no expertise or experience to comment on that.

3. During the Gulf war the extremely battle hardened (after about a decade long war with Iran) Iraqi forces fought against a western coalition that hadn’t gotten involved in a major war since Vietnam.
