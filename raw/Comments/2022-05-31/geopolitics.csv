I'm from a post-colonial nation as well - I'd contend that our state's neutrality in the current Ukrainian conflict does not reflect acquiescence towards imperialism. It's simply a matter of *realpolitik.* 

I really don't think that the Indian state is okay with having imperialist powers on its land. It's simply a consequence of how the world was aligned for the past 70 years.

I argue that it can always amount to unwanted interference - America has utilised a similar approach to destabilise regimes in the past. 

Moreover, countries such as China may not have a very independent press but it is not something that the average citizen there is perturbed by. They are well aware of the kind of restrictions their government imposes on them but are okay with it due to China's incredible rise in the past decades. 

It's a dicey argument - not every country wants the brand of freedom that America ostensibly claims to provide (or use as cover for a coup).",1fea4faec62e313d61105a4ba12005b7325bf2d6,True,False,,,,,0,1654010611,,0,{},iao7dzy,False,t3_v1or6z,False,True,t1_iao6iof,/r/geopolitics/comments/v1or6z/only_ukraines_neutrality_can_solve_the/iao7dzy/,1654010623,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1653981811.0,

Not just less lucrative, but also smaller markets. Russia sells 2.2 million barrels per day of oil and 1.2 million bpd of oil products to Europe. Since the war started, Indian import of Russian oil (products) has increased from 0.3 to 0.7 million bpd. China's import has increased from 0.8 to 1.1 million bpd. 

If Russia were to lose Europe, they stand to lose 3.4 million bpd at high prices, whereas India and China are probably buying at below-market prices and have only increased consumption by 0.7 million bpd, and I doubt they can increase it much further.

[],False,,LemmingPractice,,,[],,,,text,t2_1hfhp15q,False,False,"Why would the West run out of steam and patience? They aren't even committing troops, just money. The US spent about a decade in both Iraq and Afghanistan, while committing troops. Continuing to write cheques for American companies to make weapons is a whole lot easier than that, and this time they have Europe enthusiastically helping to foot the bill.

The current situation is actually great for the West. It has brought NATO together in a way they haven't been in decades. It is even finally bringing Finland and Sweden on board.

Most importantly, it lets the West deal with the biggest threat to European without committing troops.

Putin messed up. He committed to a bad war, and he can't politically afford to back down. He got the initial ""rally to the flag"" support (backed by his state owned media propaganda), but that wanes with time, especially as the bodybags come back and returning vets tell the stories about what's actually going on.

This is looking like Putin's Vietnam. If it goes on, his support will slowly erode (to the extent that his support is actually real, and not just propaganda, at this point), as the economic realities set in and bodybags come back. Either Russia is significantly weakened in its ability to threaten Europe, through a prolonged economic downturn, fueled by sanctions and an expensive war, or Putin gets overthrown. Either option is a win for the West, so why would the West let him off the hook? Why would the West let him save face and consolidate power, so that he can threaten European peace the next time he thinks he's well prepared to do so? There isn't likely to be a better time than the present to deal with Putin.

The point of the sanctions aren't to ""punish"" Russia, they are to diminish Russia's ability to afford a prolonged war. The longer they are in place, the more effect they will have. Time is on the West's side here, they can write these cheques for years without blinking an eye. Putin is the one on a clock. He needs a quick victory, because the longer this drags on, the more Russia suffers economically, and the less credible his ""its all part of the plan"" narrative becomes. Sooner or later, someone will just depose him, which starts a new opportunity to end the war and maybe even bring Russia back into the western fold.

Also, as a PS, don't forget about the messaging this all sends to China. This war may prevent a Taiwanese war. China is seeing how disastrously this is turning out for Putin, and seeing the West hold the line on sanctions (ones that would utterly wreck China, if ever implemented against them) is a strong deterrent for Xi. If the West backs down and lets Putin claim a victory and remain in power, it tells Xi that he may be able to survive a loss in Taiwan, in the worst case scenario. Letting Putin off the hook could be the difference between war or peace in the Taiwan strait, and China is a much bigger threat to the US than China right now.",0e3d894e23c75ecc14cfdd5d07e5a92cf01689df,True,False,,,,,0,1654007167,,0,{},ianzku6,False,t3_v1or6z,False,False,t1_iankuh5,/r/geopolitics/comments/v1or6z/only_ukraines_neutrality_can_solve_the/ianzku6/,1654007180,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1653978367.0,True

My bad

&gt;With that said, there is no correlation between receiving high amounts of economic aid (not military) and a claim that contends that the US hasn't supported India in the past.

You're not making sense. The economic aid is a form of support from the US to India. The $65 Billion that was transferred to India is no small amount and meant to ease economic hardships inside India. How can you claim that economic aid that India received is not support? What would you call that aid then?   


&gt;It's not an either-or situation. US lack of support to India in crucial situations as well as attempts to threaten it during the 1971 war are well documented.

So are you expecting the US to provide India with blank support? India was aligned with the USSR in 1971 and the US was aligned with Pakistan. Naturally the US backed its ally and the USSR backed its ally. The contention that the US should be providing India with blank support sounds very entitled.   


And frankly that's why the US has stopped courting India as a strategic ally due to the entitlement on the Indian end and asking for too much in return for support. US already has the best allies it can possibly need whether in Western Europe(Germany, UK, France) or Asia (Japan, Australia and South Korea). Or frankly, the US economic and military might does not need allies and they alone are enough to overwhelm China and Russia alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;How does getting more economic aid offset such behaviour?  


That aid is a form of support. The Government of India was welcome to return back the aid but it did not, it happily accepted the aid.   


&gt;Moreover, it would do you well to actually look at yearly trends of aid given to India and Pakistan. Aid has been regulated in consonance with India's proximity to the Soviet Union  
  
The aid received by Pakistan is much higher on a comparative basis, 45 billion dollars for a country with 1/6th of the population of India.

That's irrelevant what other countries received or how you want to split it by per capita. Bottom line is, India received the highest amount of economic aid from the US Post World War 2. Thus, the assertion that the US hasn't supported India in the past is absurb as best.",7e85bdfd4532b562d5a367261e0d3eecd5822418,True,False,,,,,0,1654000580,,0,{},ianmgxc,False,t3_ux49cf,False,True,t1_ianensl,/r/geopolitics/comments/ux49cf/pakistan_reaps_what_it_sowed_how_the_countrys/ianmgxc/,1654000593,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1653971780.0,

With that said, there is no correlation between receiving high amounts of economic aid (not military) and a claim that contends that the US hasn't supported India in the past. 

It's not an either-or situation. US lack of support to India in crucial situations as well as attempts to threaten it during the 1971 war are well documented. 

How does getting more economic aid offset such behaviour? 

Moreover, it would do you well to actually look at yearly trends of aid given to India and Pakistan. Aid has been regulated in consonance with India's proximity to the Soviet Union

The aid received by Pakistan is much higher on a comparative basis, 45 billion dollars for a country with 1/6th of the population of India. 

From 'The U.S. Aid To India: A Study In Foreign Diplomacy"" by Y.O Reddy - 

"" The Indo-US aid relations have been marked by ups and downs  
 depending largely upon American interests in India. Although every  
 American administration since 1947 had gone on record as being in favour  
 of large scale aid to India, misunderstandings had arisen as to India's  
 economic and foreign policies. America's misgivings about Indian foreign  
 policy, particularly in relation to the communist countries, have affected  
 the magnitude of aid sanctioned. From 1947 to 1952 the escalating cold  
 war in Europe resulted in only limited economic aid for India. The US  
 viewed the newly independent countries stability through military rather  
 economic measures.""

"" Towards the end of 1949, India was almost on the face of famine  
 and requested US to help meet the food shortage. The US responded  
 positively. But the delays and misunderstandings, including an attempt to  
 barter the wheat for strategic materials frustrated the accord. While India  
 criticized the food aid as a policy leveller, the US complained that Indians  
 failed to make a formal request. In 1950, the Government of India made  
 a formal request for the supply of two million tonnes of wheat. During the  
 early years of the aid debate, the US Congressmen complained that India  
 showed neither sympathy nor understanding of US international problems  
 and urged that its aid bill be rejected. However, after an acrimonious  
 debate, the US enacted the Indian Emergency Food Act in 1951. As a  
 result India was given a long term loan of $190 million of wheat"" 

The high-point of such 'aid' programmes was reached in the early 1960s. So yes, using aggregated data (adjusted for inflation, used as a tool for politicking and blind to aid given to regional rivals) is not nearly enough on your part to say that the other commenter's claim is 'invalid'.",d7f928fa8547b7871653b4148c53c428c9b0ed58,True,False,,,,,0,1653995639,,0,{},ianensl,False,t3_ux49cf,False,True,t1_ianczme,/r/geopolitics/comments/ux49cf/pakistan_reaps_what_it_sowed_how_the_countrys/ianensl/,1653995655,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1653966839.0,

Meanwhile, long-time US friends like Saudi Arabia and newer partners like India are starting to hedge their bets by cosying up to these regimes.

Is the post-Cold War, US-led world order fracturing? It certainly looks like it. America’s enemies no longer fear her — and her friends don’t wholly trust her.

But until they can give access to businesses to everyone and not just PRC members, China's population just cannot compete with the rest of the world.

This is by far and away the most accurate take on this subject. Fundamentally, the issue is one that is related to the fact that the Party's priority is the maintenance of their grip on power and Party primacy in all things.

As for the Monroe doctrine, again since WW2 I’m not certain that has been identified by Pacific island nations? Similarly, I’m not certain Pacific island nations have particularly cared about the extent of US and other Western countries’ human rights abuses - other than obviously that it has allowed an opening for China recently.
