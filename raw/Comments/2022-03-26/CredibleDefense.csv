Consider the possibility that one side achieves what it believes is 100 certain protection, then surely it would increase their willingness to use the nuclear option as it would believe it would be protected, whereas the opposing side would not.

The only way to know it works 100% would be to test it, in actual practice and depending on the particular leader they may, or may not care about a certain level of collateral damage to achieve the victory.

It would also likely elevate a limited, targeted decapitation strike from the opposition into an all out, try and brute force pass the defenses approach.

If the raise of conventional war did occur and the fighting was street to street in Paris, if Russia felt they had a solid anti Mad defense screen, i would think they would be more likely to deploy nuclear weapons in the theater if counter attacks gained momentum, and frankly the only practical way to assault America would be long range missiles.

Ultimately when I said that it was to prove my prior point (that size isn't ""always"" an asset.) I absolutely agree that size can definitely equal a hard advantage. (plus the soft intimidation factor that Russia has been relying on to help its foreign policy.)   


In my opinion the problem with size is that its soft power factor can be defeated should your large army suffer a defeat to an enemy significantly smaller than yours.   


While numbers always provides a hard advantage it dosent always equal soft factors too. aside from what I just mentioned larger armies are also harder to maintain, upgrade, service. They bring disadvantages just like they bring advantages.

I agree that support in Russia seems to be pro war and I also agree that the effect of nationalism will diminish as time drags on.  


However in my opinion High civilian morale does not equal High Military morale. Ultimately once the new recruits hit the field and are confronted with reality the formerly hype soldier becomes another depressed conscript.

In a Sino-India conflict, can the Chinese use this leverage to force Russia to supplying spares etc. Possibly. However, it would be an error to assume that Indian defence planners have not gamed this scenario na shave not worked out alternatives.

The presence of kill switches may indeed exist in Russian equipment. But it is known that they exist in Western equipment. Moreover, with Western equipment, the kill-switch is a ""second measure"". The ""first measure"" is merely an indication to Washington either to its own arms peddlers or to arms sellers in Europe/the West to cut off supplies. From the Indian perspective, the US and the West (with a few exceptions) are highly fickle and unreliable and this is not merely a preconception, it is the result of first hand experience over the years.

The above is one reason why recent (over the last 2 decades) Indian procurement (especially of aircraft, air defence systems, communication networks, naval systems) has the peculiar feature of requiring the integration of Indian sub-systems, which are locally designed and made. We have seen this in Indian acquisitions of not only Russian equipment but also of US equipment (check out the modifications to the P8-I) and Israeli equipment.

As a consequence, as I have argued above, India's overriding strategic imperative is to become self-reliant at least where some of it's basic systems are concerned. India is already self-reliant in strategic weapons and their delivery platforms including SSBNs. Indian is self reliant in its first and second layer of air defence systems etc etc. But much more needs to be done. Till that level of self-reliance is actualized, it remains a strategic weakness for India.

One last point about a Sino-Indian conflict. It should be remembered that terrain dictates and will dictate the nature of the clash between India and China. Further, it should also be kept in mind that India is the defender in that terrain and has the advantage of commanding the heights in most stretches of what could potentially be the battlespace. And, thirdly, the PLAAF is operating at a significant disadvantage in that particular battlespace given the fact that (1) their ""safe"" bases are at extended ranges which means the combat time that their fighters can spend over the battlespace is limited (2) their fighters will remain vulnerable to long range A-2-A countermeasures initiated by the IAF, and (3) the IAF can very easily disperse from their forward air bases to locations deeper within the county while remaining within strike range of the potential battlespace (augmented by the use of air refuellers/tankers, which will remain out of range of Chinese interdiction attempts).",b7905e33cba6313f9a2532e63082e1c8db92af62,True,False,,,,,0,1648328837,,0,{},i28k71d,False,t3_tko843,False,True,t1_i26t6hk,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tko843/purchasing_from_a_pariah_indias_armsacquisition/i28k71d/,1648328848,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648300037.0,

I think you are being extremely complacent in your comment, especially with the rise of China and India.

America came really close to losing its pre-eminence during the Trump years, and in fact, is still not yet out of the woods. Rightly or wrongly, but the US was treated as something of a joke by the social media generation, and one can see why; its terrible response to the COVID-19 pandemic, America's unique social issues such as healthcare, opiate pandemic, or racial tension, which are in turn amplified hundredfold, partly by the world's obsession with all issues American, and partly by extreme partisan rancor. By partisan rancor, I mean Democrats and Republicans trying to dunk on one another by any means necessary, which in turn is another serious issue.

Imagine if Trump won his re-election in 2020, and had to work with his NATO allies to confront Putin in Ukraine. Trump himself is no great bureaucrat or diplomat - there is no political bias in stating this - and by the end of his administration, he was really scraping the bottom of the barrel in terms of available talent, because so few people were still willing to work with him. Trump and his team almost certainly would have failed in Ukraine. He may even have tried to sabotage Zelensky and American allies. Imagine what would have happened to American credibility then. Total disaster.

We are rightly happy about how Russia turned out to be no match for the West, but Russians are the rivals of yesteryear. There are 10 times more Chinese or Indians than there are Russians in this world, and the Chinese at least have proven themselves to be well on a path towards continued economic development. China is an openly adversarial nation, and India is at best a fair weather friend and the enemy of the enemy, as the current crisis has shown.

Hmmm, I agree mostly with what you're saying - but I think it overlooks that things like Bush's wars, or Trump's, well, everything do have a non-negligible negative impact on US power. Maybe not military power, but certainly in terms of soft power, and also certainly in terms of overall trustworthiness + willingness of allies to follow the American lead.

Now don't get me wrong, none of the blowback is impactful in and of itself, but I do think it's the beginning of a 'death by a thousand cuts'. I do think the return to normalcy with Biden, and, ironically enough, Putin's actions, mean that much of the damage done by Trump has been repaired - but I don't think it has been fully repaired by any stretch.

China is a much much lesser concern for the EU than it is for the US, and I think maintaining that level of power through alliances and diplomacy that the US has enjoyed for the past 70 years will be very important for its prospects of maintaining hegemony. Europe is not going to once again be the centre of the world as it was up until WW2, so it won't threaten US hegemony in that way - but if there is a significant deterioration in relations between China and the US, then I think there is the potential for the EU to take a much more 'fence-sitting' position than the US would like, and it is still one of the largest, richest markets on the planet.

I don't think it's likely that that happens any time soon, but I think it is something that US policymakers, diplomats, and ultimately Presidents, will have to be aware of.

As some examples: Over reporting kills is endemic to Airforce combat (specifically in ground attacks or CAS) as from the perspective of an aircraft it can be very difficult to discern the status of your target after you dropped bombs or shot rockets/missiles at it.  


German tank units in WW2 also often overinflated their kills (especially near the end of the war) by reporting Halftrack kills or AT gun Kills as: ""Armored targets"".

I think **one of the largest lessons of the Ukraine war** is also something that I feel is a huge factor when **rating US presidents**.

Which is that the USA has a preeminent place in the world after 1945 and a practically indispensable one after 1991. 

In plain English, it's really hard for voters (or Presidents) to screw up their own country. We have leeway that other countries just do not get. 

And I think this is a big issue when people talk about whether George W. Bush is, like, a better or worse president than Zachary Taylor. 

And similarly when people compare the Iraq war to Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

When George W. Bush held roll call at a cabinet meeting, the first person to raise their hand was in charge of overseeing the world's most powerful military with more power projection than the next several rivals combined. The next person to hold up their hand was in charge of issuing the world's reserve currency. The next few people after that were in charge of regulatory oversight for the richest, most innovative and most dynamic economy in the world.

Zachary Taylor didn't have that.

And the consequence is:

The USA can declare preemptive, unilateral invasions of other countries, tear up *nuclear* treaties just one POTUS term after signing them, insult our allies, browbeat our trade partners, refuse to comply with international law, and after all this we're still #1.

It's not just that each new President allows the world to pretend that America is ""resetting"" itself. The reality is that even *during* a crazy/bad president's term all of our allies desperately turn a blind eye and pretend things are normal. America is indispensable. We can literally do *almost* anything and the rest of the world will still deal with us, happily or unhappily, they have no choice.

Meanwhile you look at things like Brexit in the UK, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Orbanism in Hungary, etc. The damage to each country's position &amp; credibility is immediate, real, and long lasting.

About the author: 

&gt; The below comment was written by J. Peter Scoblic and edited by Josh Rosenberg. Peter is a senior fellow with the International Security Program at New America, where he researches strategic foresight, prediction, and the future of nuclear weapons. He has also served as deputy staff director of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, where he worked on approval of the New START agreement, and he is the author of U.S. vs. Them, an intellectual history of conservatism and nuclear strategy. 

The summary of the article: 

&gt; On March 10th, the Samotsvety forecasting team published a Forum post assessing the risk that a London resident would be killed in a nuclear strike “in light of the war in Ukraine and fears of nuclear escalation.” It recommended against evacuating major cities because the risk of nuclear death was extremely low. However, the reasoning behind the forecast was questionable.

&gt; The following is intended as a constructive critique to improve the forecast quality of nuclear risk, heighten policymaker responsiveness to probabilistic predictions, and ultimately reduce the danger of nuclear war. By implication, it makes the case that greater subject matter expertise can benefit generalist forecasters—even well-calibrated ones. 

The forecast in question: 

&gt; “Will there be a NATO/Russia nuclear exchange killing at least one person in the next month?” (Samotsvety aggregate forecast: 0.067%/month [0.8%/year]",7b47a816de86ee9608a17d5cbd6c0f248217765c,True,False,,,,,0,1648313221,,0,{},i27kmj1,True,t3_tox6vn,False,True,t3_tox6vn,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tox6vn/nuclear_expert_comment_on_samotsvety_nuclear_risk/i27kmj1/,1648313233,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648284421.0,

No, that's always been Putin's MO. Russia has an open border policy with Central Asia and millions of immigrants from there, how do you reconcile this with extreme ethnic nationalism? [And he did crackdown on the far right.](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2017/12/16/the-death-of-the-russian-far-right)   
  
I don't find Kamil Galeev worth reading, and it's another shitty take from him. In this war, Chechens aren't doing anything other than filming tiktoks. And yes, Putin has always been ""woke"" in a way. Ethnic nationalists don't like him and don't like how Putin handles this war, again in his ""woke"" fashion. Something I posted the other day, originally from a Russian nationalist:  

""I received information from the AP about information support for the special operation. The Chechens are making publicity consciously, at the personal direction of those close to the country's leadership: there is an instruction to avoid the label of the Russian Spring as much as humanly possible. No Russian World, no Irredenta, no return of historical territory. Since 2014, the fear of Russians has not weakened, but intensified, especially against the backdrop of anti-migrant sentiment in 2020-21. That is why all possible measures were taken to rebrand the operation compared to 2014.""

Well, actually, all this is absolutely clear without any insiders, as they say, everything is straightforward. Some anti-fascists (whatever that means) instead of the Russian army - what is that? Well, here it is. Who are the most famous Russian commanders of this special operation? Well, Ramzan Kadyrov and Adam Delimkhanov. The Russian public doesn't know anyone else, and hasn't heard anything about those who are still in command of the troops. They're not in the media field. And there are no Russians. We don't need them.

Or the issue of flags. Well, the idiotic ( from the military point of view) decision not to touch Ukrainian flags, by necessity they began to violate, otherwise it is difficult to contain the situation, it is necessary to make it clear that the authorities have changed, and for this a new flag is a very distinctive way. And here we see the difference in approaches. In Melitopol, where there are DNR militia raised the Russian flag, in Energodar - the Soviet flag. If raising the Russian flag means that the territory is controlled by Russia, then what does raising the Red flag in Energodar mean? Have they decided to restore the Soviet Union there, by the workers of the nuclear power plant? This is outright schizophrenia, but it will do, as long as there is no Russian spirit.

Bulba writes that the Donetsk infantry (which, by the way, proved to be excellent in combat) was preemptively driven into frontal attacks on fortifications in order to ""dispose of"" ideologically motivated fighters. To be honest, I am not sure, because DNR forces are disciplined enough and will not disobey orders. They can act independently outside DNR territory, based on their understanding of the situation, but there is no problem stopping them. However, I can't rule anything out, given the presence of the overcautious and (probably) pro-Ukrainian in the headquarters. Let's hope it hasn't come to this.

Yeah, they're still struggling to get out from under the effects of late-Soviet ""communism"". Philosophically, the communist economic system had no real fungible monetary apparatus, so the typical political backscratching we have in the west where politicians conveniently find easy ways to ""earn"" money in the private sector wouldn't work. Instead they developed a byzantine under the table barter-like system where higher ups would find themselves mysteriously in possession of summer houses, nicer cars, and state employees as personal servants. The transition to a free market type system basically just transferred that same institutionalized dishonesty into outright *stealing money* from the government. As a result, when the Russian Army tries to procure (say) Azart encrypted radios, the company contracted to do that procures the radio bodies and transceivers from China to look like they're doing *something*, but then the rest of the money which was for building and installing the Russian-made crypto boards just seems to mysteriously evaporate. The result is only enough to equip the airborne forces, but even those are plagued by poor battery life and various other issues because they *really* don't have the money to test and iterate the design to work the bugs out.

They were posting showing that the Russians were not just out on exercise but building the infrastructure for an invasion things like fueling depots, field hospitals and the way they were setting up the helicopter parks. 

I am in no way open source but what aroused my suspicion off the charts was when Putin started messing around with the gas in Q4 2021. I always assumed that the only time Russia would try to drop gas to Europe was in a war, so claims they were throttling to spike prices really worried me. Point being the Germans always assumed that Russia could be dealt with as rational business people. If they ever acted in a non business way, this would push Europe to plan to decouple. 

Others took the diplomatic signals as red alerts. 

&gt;My argument regarding Russia's behavior:  
1) Moscow switched from deterrence to compellence   
2) The key issue is Moscow believes Kyiv will remain hostile and is increasing its defensive capabilities  
3) the costs of inaction are greater than an escalation

There were obvious reasons to not think they were going to attack like it  was so diplomatically dumb and it would create a huge reaction in Europe. Many people to the very rational opinion is that even a successful attack would be irrational.

&gt;
&gt;VINDMAN: I would say, I'm somewhere at an eight, which is pretty amazing. I - this weekend, as I was thinking about these meetings unfolding, I kind of had the pre-combat patrol, pre-battle jitters of recognizing something really serious was coming.

&gt;KELLY: And why? What was it you were looking at that was giving you the jitters?
&gt;
&gt;VINDMAN: Because right now, as far apart as the sides are, Russians have laid out a maximalist position. The U.S. said it's not willing to negotiate on very principled positions - I agree with those positions - on sovereign states determining their own orientation and rolling back the clock on the NATO alliance back to 1997. I don't see - and Russia's main focus here, which is achieving a failed state in Ukraine - how we could overcome these things. There is - the most likely scenario in my mind is a major military offensive in Ukraine. I hope I'm wrong, but that's what I see. The less likely scenario is some sort of diplomatic negotiation with some off ramps, with some face-saving measures, where the Russians can say, well, we are in the midst of negotiations - we might be able to achieve what we want.

[],False,,TTauriStellarBody,,,[],,,,text,t2_2dfg3ugh,False,False,"&gt;The stability–instability paradox is an international relations theory regarding the effect of nuclear weapons and mutually assured destruction. It states that when two countries each have nuclear weapons, the probability of a direct war between them greatly decreases, but the probability of minor or indirect conflicts between them increases.\[1\]\[2\]\[3\] This occurs because rational actors want to avoid nuclear wars, and thus they neither start major conflicts nor allow minor conflicts to escalate into major conflicts—thus making it safe to engage in minor conflicts. For instance, during the Cold War the United States and the Soviet Union never engaged each other in warfare, but fought proxy wars in Korea, Vietnam, Angola, the Middle East, Nicaragua and Afghanistan and spent substantial amounts of money and manpower on gaining relative influence over the third world.\[4\]  
&gt;  
&gt;A study published in the Journal of Conflict Resolution in 2009 quantitatively evaluated the nuclear peace hypothesis, and found support for the existence of the stability–instability paradox. The study determined that while nuclear weapons promote strategic stability, and prevent large scale wars, they simultaneously allow for more lower intensity conflicts. When one state has nuclear weapons, but their opponent does not, there is a greater chance of war. In contrast, when there is mutual nuclear weapon ownership with both states possessing nuclear weapons, the odds of war drop precipitously.\[5\]  
&gt;  
&gt;This effect can be seen in the India–Pakistan relationship and to some degree in Russia–NATO relations.

In short, Shoigu supposedly was the longest serving minister because he a) is not technically ethnian Russian, and thus cannot claim power for himself, and b) because he never pissed off anybody in his while chain, which then caused subpar and incomplete deliveries being accepted, accounted, and paid for at the paper value.

Corruption cannot be centralised. As such it absolutely makes sense that parallel realities developed between what's there for Putin to see on paper or parades, and what's there doing the fighting. Same thing for economics, Putin  very probably miscalculated not only the western response, but also how vulnerable Russia is. From this angle I'm certainly willing to believe that he has systematically received bad information.

Putin cannot be blind to his lack of success and the probable replacement of quite some high level personal is probably testament to this. However, if corruption is so endemic to the nation, would a new set of advisors actually be an improvement? Theur information is likely doctored by the very same mechanism just one step down. In fact, it's questionable if there even are people in Russia with the full picture. Cleaning this up, even if fully recognized, is a task that takes far longer than the current crisis.

I cannot tell how close Putins thinking currently is to reality. However, even with the partial information we here are getting we can be certain that the invasion was a mistake, given the rediculous scale of damage Russia has taken in a number of domains. Barring diverging information, I would assume by default that Putin has enough grasp on the outline of this situation to recognize this as well. He should thus have realised the mistake at this point in time. What you outlined is exactly how he came to make this mistake in the first place, or at least that's the most credible explanation available to me.

&gt;Putin’s been a pretty rational actor from what I can tell

I'd highlight this line for a moment to go off a tangential rant. For my taste way too much is being handwaved as Putin being mad at the moment. Even if it were true, ^(which I honestly do not know enough about to make a sane prediction) everything gets cramped into this box by popular narrative.

[],False,,221missile,,,[],,,,text,t2_10oupmyn,False,False,"The Northrop Grumman B-21A Raider is a U.S. bomber under development that is projected to reach initial operational capability in the mid-2020s. It is now is the most advanced member of an evolving family of systems for long-range strike capabilities.

The U.S. Air Force (USAF) has confirmed a few details regarding the technical performance and characteristics. Inferences can be made from official Northrop Grumman and service supplied renderings as well as the aircraft’s program history.

Few details are known about the technical requirements for the B-21. The program is needed, officials say, to prosecute the most highly defended targets around the globe, particularly highly mobile systems, such as air defenses, and hard and deeply buried targets, such as command and control and nuclear facilities. These targets require tracking through the moment of strike or precisely targeted penetrator weapons, thus making them unsuitable for standoff weapons such as cruise missiles.

Given the short development schedule, it is likely that B-21 will use existing hardware and technology, at least in its initial version, with multiple block increments in future plans. One requirement considered obvious is broadband stealth to enable the aircraft to evade detection even by search radars operating in the VHF band. The aircraft will likely incorporate a new generation of stealth technology beyond the F-35 in terms of capability, survivability, producibility and maintainability.

Renderings of the B-21 released last year depicts a novel, upward-sloping windscreen design. Building on more than three decades of B-2 operations, Northrop knew the similarly configured B-21 needed a new windscreen layout in the cockpit. Although the B-2’s four-pane layout offered excellent forward visibility, B-21 pilots need better lateral visibility, especially higher on the sides of the cockpit during refueling operations.

The renderings of the B-21 show other visual changes from a similar flying-wing layout of the B-2 that possibly reveal advances in stealth design (relocated engine inlets), a lighter aircraft (smaller landing gear) and a shift to high-altitude operations (a V-shaped trailing edge).

In May 2021, the USAF requested $108 million for advanced procurement funding of the first series-production B-21s in the fiscal 2022 budget. Aircraft deliveries typically follow three years after advanced procurement funding is awarded, suggesting a time frame between late 2024 and 2025. That timing generally tracks with construction plans at Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota, the planned first main operating base. A $1 billion construction program to support B-21 operations at Ellsworth is expected to be completed between 2026 and 2031, according to a Nov. 22 2021 report by the Air Force Civil Engineer Center.

On March 3, 2022, the USAF announced that the first B-21 Raider test aircraft has started ground evaluations, and the sixth example of the next-generation bomber has started production. 

Although the program of record calls for buying a “minimum of 100” B-21s to replace the B-2 and B-1B fleets, the USAF's preferred number may be 50% higher. A fleet of 149 B-21s and 76 reengined B-52s would fulfill the Air Force Global Strike Command’s “preferred” complement of 225 bombers.",4a4a161325bd0a46995c5cdc84c2383422e61578,True,False,,,,,0,1648298617,,0,{},i26pw3x,True,t3_tonp7m,False,True,t3_tonp7m,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tonp7m/a_closer_look_at_northrop_grummans_b21/i26pw3x/,1648298633,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648269817.0,

Have you seen his speech at one of Russia's largest stadium in front of thousands of Russians? According to the Washington Post ""Mr. Putin has declared that Ukrainians are not a real people but actually Russian part of a Slavic heartland that also includes Belarus."" (Erlanger 2022)https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/16/world/europe/putin-war-ukraine-recolonization.html  As such it would not make sense for an Imperialist like Putin to nuke Ukraine and threaten his objective and credibility at home. 

For instance the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 was against USSR and at the time the USSR already had nuclear weapons but did not launch any nuclear weapons on Hungary and instead sent their forces there and violently repressed the revolution, which resulted in thousands of deaths, all they needed to do was send a military force of 31k and 1.3k tanks to reinstitute political indoctrination. Thus if Russia wanted to repress the revolution in Ukraine, they could do that without any nuclear weapons and only supplement their troops with more reinforcements, they are already doing that and no matter how you see it the war will end up as a Ukrainian insurgency vs. a professional Russian standing army https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956 

Moreover, the propaganda is to free Ukraine from Nazis and not obliterate Ukraine with nuclear weapons.

That said, a month ago all I heard was how ""smart"" and ""clever"" Putin was in his strategy and how he had out-played Biden and the West.  Heck I was largely with them; I did not think Ukraine was the Ukraine that we have seen.  Not many people anticipated what's happening.

I think viewing NATO as antagonizing Russia and threatening their survival is to shallow Putin's lies.  NATO exists mainly because all the nations besides the US would like the protection of the US.  Why would that be?  Well maybe if you are Poland or Latvia, you remember that the country to your east has chosen to maintain distance from Europe.  The Russian mindset has been cultivated that the ""west"" is inherently bad.  And the Russian version of capitalism, basically nepotism + unofficial socialism, I'm sure has disillusioned many Russians about both the economic and political structures of the West, something that the West tries to propagate.

The other US ""leader"" spend the first 24hr of the invasion blabbering on the phone to anyone who would listen about how smart Putin was and how this supposedly would not have happened under a different President.  Such notions are foolish and belie, suggesting a naive world view.  Call me crazy but I'd prefer a President who didn't view national security through the lens of what's good for his hospitality business.

Putin keeps claiming NATO threatens Russia.  This makes no sense given that NATO has existed essentially all of post-WW2 to now.  Yes it has expanded several time, and the Russians claim that is the work of the ""puppet-masters"" in the West.  Personally I have the impression that the Russian people have been around long enough to know all the Soviet tricks.  There's still nationalism, but I think there's a large degree of 'jadedness' with the last 20-years of ""progress"" in Russia.  

And last we have Putin who I do not believe is fully rational in his decision-making at this point.  if you read what he's written about the so-called historical Russia, he really does believe the Soviet borders are what Russia should encompass.  And historically he's mostly wrong as many of these areas he lays claim to are ethnically *not* Russian.

What's important to remember is that Zhukov like all historical sources witnessed history different from our ex post perspective. He may be an authority on the STAVKA's perspective but even after the war he didn't have a complete image on the Wehrmacht's true strategic capabilities post 1942/1943. It's also important to remember that Zhukov was exceptionally sympathetic towards the USA so his statements after the war were meant to counteract the official Soviet historiography of the 60s which belittled the effort of the western allies for obvious reasons.

We can say for sure that lend lease did not save the Soviets in 1941 and 1942 simply because it was still severely limited. The Red Army takes the sole credit for stalling the Wehrmacht along the Leningrad, Moscow and even Stalingrad axis. The offensives after Stalingrad probably wouldn't have been successful without the help of lend lease but that's where we get into contrafactual history.

 E.g. David Glantz states that without lend lease it would have taken the Soviets 12 - 18 months longer to win the war. While he's one of the major authorities on the Eastern Front I think that's very optimistic to say the least. But I also don't think that Germany could have achieved its strategic objectives after 1943.

Sorry can you tell me which city you are talking about. They had to put their offensive on Kharkiv on hold to pull troops out for Sumy. 

They have 10 000s trapped in undefendable and unretreatable salients towards Kyiv. This gives them huge exposed lines. Like the outcome of Market Garden, expect 2 of them and they do not have a couple of million men in a front to relieve any pressure. 

Those 2 are likely the most disastrous large scale mechanised operation in Europe since ""[Unternehmen Wacht am Rhein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Bulge#German_plans)"".

&gt;This was a part of the plan.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ukrainians would have a never ending supply of forces to reinforce the region

No. They threw away initiative and the chance to encircle the Ukrainian best forces in the opening days of the conflict in order to pursue a madcap fantasy of an operation. This is why I say this is a failed coup, not a military operation. Mechanised warfare relies of manoevre to find weak points and bring your enemy to their destruction, encirclement allows this to happen by cutting off supplies and allowing fire from all directions without the space for retreat. 

The very fact this was planned in ""mud season"" when campaining is usually shutdown due to lack of ability to maneuver to allow rest and refit says this is not a military operation aimed at exploiting the mobility advantages of the Russian army. 

They cannot pull their forces out from around Kyiv. They risk their prewar mobilised and trained units being encircled themselves and possibly destroyed by a much weaker, much less well equipped force because of thunderous stupidity. 

There is nothing here but a face saving climb down on a monstrous waste of life. 

Monstrosity, stupidity, hubris, failure of almost every aspect of the military operation.

My point is just that the classic counterinsurgency scenario is one where there is a puppet government and a great power intervening on its behalf. The territory nominally belongs to the government in power, and the insurgency force is trying to (a) inflict high enough costs on the intervention power to make them withdraw and (b) topple the puppet government.

This clearly isn't the scenario in play in Ukraine, where the original government of the country is still very much in place and Russia is still trying and failing to take over the country.

The biggest weakness of the paper for me is the above quote is the central assumption underlying the paper's analysis, yet hardly any space in the paper is devoted to explaining it. The section I have quoted make the assertion without any supporting evidence or citation. The paper could improve by explaining how PLAN C2 operate with concrete examples. The other thing the paper could have done is to provide a framework to help assess whether PLAN is operating under command and control or mission command or a hybrid of both. 

The other limitation of the paper is that it mostly cite pre-2017 sources. Since then PLA has undergone a major reform and as the paper observes, changes are happening. Additionally, the paper mostly cites western sources instead of Chinese sources which means there would be extra latency between the analysis and what the current state of PLA is.

&gt;""In previous exercises, brigade-level offensive and defensive battles were often divided into how many groups and teams, and each group and team was directly commanded by the brigade. It seems that the division of labor is very reasonable, including various arms and various combat elements. It seems that It is a combination, but in actual application, it is often fought alone and cannot form a fist. By learning from foreign troops and reflecting on the lessons of the red and blue sides in the previous confrontation, we have found a way to combine according to the task. After receiving the combat order, Determine the tactics according to the enemy's situation, terrain and other factors, and determine the specific tasks and commanders in each direction. The commander puts forward the requirements for force, firepower, coordination, support, and support. After comprehensive measurement and review in the brigade, the equipment will be equipped according to his requirements. The military and weapons, including the power to call for artillery and helicopters, are in command of a battle group composed of various arms, including obstacle breaking teams, fire teams, etc., which are completely different from the previous single-armed groups.

I have feeling that isn't the best way of gauging Russian public opinion. 

I live in a Malaysia, a moderate Muslim country which is liberal compared to places like Saudi Arabia, but conservative by Western standards and the Malaysian public is generally disapproving of things such as LGBT stuff, but if I were to ask people from the college I went to, a liberal place I'd get mostly supportive and pro LGBT answers.

Now, I don't know which part of Russia this guy interviews people from, so I don't know the full context, so I can't make a complete judgement, but I do have my doubts.

There is a whole section on the absence non commissioned officer in the Russian military, I was going to quote it but it doesn't make sense to quote the whole thing. The lack of an NCO corps has been mentioned many times by knowledgeable commentators. What I found interesting in this write up is that there is a combination of there not being nearly enough of them, and there being not enough power given to them over their soldiers and conscripts.

Dedovshchina or their system of hazing is something of a legend in regards to the Russian military. The recent rumors of a Russian commander being murdered by his own troops by being run over, made me think back these problems. It sounds like life is extraordinarily rough for these young men. 

&gt; Dedovshchina intensified in the early post-Soviet period. Political officers (zampolit) were removed, and junior officers, who might at least be tempted to intervene in extreme cases of hazing, were focused on keeping their jobs, if not also moonlighting in another occupation just to survive. One report, quoted by the BBC in 2002, even alleged that senior soldiers were selling their juniors into prostitution. At least 15 soldiers died due to hazing in the first quarter of 2004, while the Russian Ministry of Defense’s own data listed suicide (much of it likely a result of hazing) as the cause of 40 percent of all military fatalities in 2006.

This was written less than two years ago. 

&gt; This may be a result of skepticism about major land warfare within the upper echelons of the military and Ministry of Defense. Former Russian senior officials and analysts interviewed by the RAND Corporation in 2017 unanimously dismissed the idea of orienting the Russian military on fighting major land wars with peer competitors. The decade of reform and modernization has enabled the military to capably conduct limited expeditionary operations, while modernization at the other end of the spectrum has secured Russia’s strategic nuclear forces on land, in the air, and in naval bastions. Russia’s military leaders seem to think the prospect of a major conventional war with NATO is highly unlikely.

The wider societal impacts of the current war could reverberate for decades. The old days of mass casualties not rocking the boat in the USSR appear to be over. 

&gt; Conscripts are not allowed to serve abroad, and contracted soldiers are not treated like cannon fodder.

Red Roulette has some bits about the different attitudes / trends from Dengist China to Xi’s China, but I’d say that source, beyond just being one man’s word and memories, is broadly insufficient to prove my claim. 

The more useful parts that I remember (just a student that likes to study) from that book and other literature that I could probably dig up (The names of random papers less easily come to mind) is that respected party elders generally hold a lot of influence. They act as coordinators for the shifting web of alliances that makes up a functioning Party - individually a single official is weak, but together they form a formidable bloc of influence, so officials have incentive to form intraparty factions. The factions backing Xi and Bo were, while not equal, similar enough to prevent any drastic moves from one lest party elders step in to prevent the balance of power from shifting too much.

A murder of a foreign national and the sensation generated was spark enough to disadvantage Bo, and the attempted coverup prevented his and allied factions from coordinating sufficiently to prevent him from being ousted. At the party meeting where he was ousted, the book reports Zhou Yongkang initially pushed for leniency. He got bulldozed by Xi’s faction then and later on, when he was the first sitting PSC member to be arrested in modern history in Xi’s anti corruption campaign, which itself could only happen because, again, internal opposition was in disarray.

The line that I’m drawing here is the elimination of Bo allowed Xi to claim supreme power and significantly change the course of the country, which hitherto was on a liberalizing trajectory (there’s a good amount of public information that I remember about that trajectory, tell me if you need more on that).",398a3263bf7707ce6847db1792e43da92cdb3d5d,True,False,,,,,0,1648267081,,0,{},i25l65l,False,t3_tnkipf,False,True,t1_i24km6c,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tnkipf/ukraine_megathread_march_25/i25l65l/,1648267098,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1648238281.0,

I definitely agree that there is an enourmous longing for a shred of national/tribal pride in Arabic countries, but I don't think it's because of a fall from status like in Russia - the Arabs have to go back ~600 years to find major Arab powers.
