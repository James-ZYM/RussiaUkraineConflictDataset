Even if not destroyed they are unable to get into Donbass where is it needed. The donbass entrance/exits are mostly controlled by Russia - at least roads/rail roads. Just a couple days ago, a ""shopping mall"" in Odessa got hit by a Russian missile and went up in a mushroom cloud. Many captured mercenaries and Ukrainians report that they lack enough bullets. Much is said of Russian logistics but the Ukrainians have issues.

It is absolutely and utterly in no a way a neutral sky. Russia mostly has air superiority - manpads contest it but doesn't constitute a real air defense. At best, you can say it's contested but even then Russia has barely used it bombers. They are probably limiting their precision guided bombs use but if Ukraine is really going on offensive, they will use dumb bombs from high altitudes which will cause horrific damage due to their inaccuracy - but the Soviet stockpiles of those are effectively infinite. 

And in general, Russian doctrine of deep battle is focused on artillery, not airpower. It's a Soviet Tactic, a direct continuation of Tsarist Russia tactics. The Russian officer corps is very academic and the Russian army is officer heavy. They are currently executing a deep operation in the Donbass. If you pay attention to real US military experts (not the defense grifters), trained in the cold War (like Gen Daniel Davis, General Douglas Mcgregor, and Lt Scott Ritter) - they all point to the exact same thing.

Russia can declare victory at any point and sell it at home. Once the money pit becomes too great (and it will) Russia will have no choice to make up a new victory condition and peace out.

Ukraine, on the other half will - in the long term - be a on an upward trajectory thanks in no small part to the economic and military backing of the west. The lend-lease is obviously symbolically a big deal, and the $30 billion assistance Biden is pushing through congress as we speak even bigger, and then there's already talk of a ""Marshall Plan"" for the longer term. By the way, a third of those $30 billion is earmarked for civil economic or humanitarian relief, not military aid and training. That's getting close to 10% of Ukraine's entire GDP is just one aid package from one country.

No doubt this will be painful for Ukraine. But for your scenario to play out you will have to explain how it will be more painful than acceding more territory to Russia with a near guarantee of more to follow in the future. Putin has made his intentions abundantly clear. The idea that Russia can be made peace with in exchange for promises is...a fantasy. Ukraine certainly knows this.

And then there's the fact that ceding the Donbas would on its own devastate Ukraine's long term economic ability for a certainty. There's no upshot in giving it away against promises from Russia that it won't take more in the future.

You will also have to explain how Zelensky could possible turn around and sell it to his own people. After everything he has stated publicly.

And finally you will have to explain why the US, NATO and the EU are all seemingly pouring in obscene amounts of money into a country their analysts are presumably (using your logic) calculating will inevitably fall. These are geopolitical actors who are *escalating* their economic support of Ukraine, not dampening it. Why? Why the confidence?

Bear in mind the stated goal for the western powers is for Ukraine to *win* this conflict. And secondarily to weaken the Russian military so it won't be able to do stuff like this again anytime soon. If they're crunching the numbers and they're seeing that $30 billion isn't enough for keep the Ukraine economy afloat, then they either send more money or none at all. Otherwise it's just going down the drain.

Again, these are no longer the symbolic relief packages we saw at the start of the conflict. The US committed $100 million when they still thought it was likely Russia would win. You can find a hundred million in the US budget for geopolitical posturing. You can't find 30 billion.

But it's important to remember that this isn't a game of civilization. You don't win a war if you hold land by the time the clock you set runs out. There's no accumulation of points that you tally up at the end.

It was absolutely to be expected that Russia would seize large swaths of land. IN fact, much more than they have. The question is: **how long can it hold onto it?** 

Total Russian control of the Donbas might be inevitable (I'm not convinced, but I'm willing to entertain the idea), but that does Russia very little good if unless Ukraine agrees to a treaty ceding the Donbas to Russia. Because if Ukraine says ""nope, we're gonna keep fighting"" then the inevitability very quickly flips. What's inevitable in the long term is Russia's inability to hold onto the Donbas without Ukraine's consent (and so long as the west gives Ukraine its generous per diem).

[],False,,exoriare,,,[],,,,text,t2_7n1sq,False,False,"&gt; If Russia was not ruled by a corrupt dictator, and instead a prosperous, free democracy, why would Ukraine even want to join the EU and NATO?

Western Ukraine wanted to join the EU. The East and Donbas were very determined they wanted to retain their ties to Russia. That was the problem - that schism. 

Ukrainian nationalists have despised Russia for a century and wouldn't want anything to do with Russia under any circumstances. The Holomodor might as well as have happened yesterday as far as they're concerned. 

The schism started to erupt in 2012 with the drafting of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement. This is when the EU said that Ukraine would have to break its trade ties with Russia's CIS trade bloc if it wanted to join the EU. 

Putin suggested that maybe a compromise could work, where Ukraine could gain the benefits of EU membership while retaining its trade ties with Russia. EU said GTFO - it was one or the other. 

After that, all possibility of compromise was eliminated for Ukraine - either the West would prevail and Ukraine would join EU/NATO, or the East would win and they'd stick with Russia/CIS. This is precisely when the West broke Ukraine in two. 

&gt; Putin knows that NATO and US, are not the enemy of the Russian people, but the enemy of dictators like himself. 

Putin wanted to join NATO as early as 1999. NATO did not take this seriously. 

&gt; The success of democracies are what threatens him. 

Russia tried liberal democracy in the 90's. Their finance minister was voted the bestest financial minister in the world for the ""shock economics"" they imposed. It was a disaster - Russia got pillaged by foreign capitalists. 

That experience in the 90's was what paved the way for an authoritarian like Putin - he wasn't afraid to bend the law to seize  assets of foreign corporations. ""Rule of Law"" was seen as something that benefited huge corporations that could trap naive country bumpkins like Russia. 

&gt; Putin does not care about Russians, as evidenced by his willingness to send their youngsters to die to make sure his regime is secure.

Ukraine is the only one using forced conscription. (Russia used conscripts in their initial invasion, when they thought they would be ""greeted as liberators""). If Zelensky is so popular, why does he need to force people to fight for him? (this is really pissing them off in Transcarpathia, where they themselves want autonomy or closer ties to Hungary, but now their militia has been forced to the front). 

&gt; Why wouldn’t Ukraine form a closer relationship with their more ethnically related country?

To me it seems apperent that any settled peace is going to end up with Russia retaining most of its conquered territory and new security assurances against Ukraine ever formally joining NATO. This is more or less going to match what Russian diplomats described to NATO in negotiations before the war as their red lines, independance for the eastern provinces, Crimea, de-nazification (which is so unquantifiable as to be meaningless really).  
  
So if the pre-war line in the sand is going tobe the same as the post war reality, what really then was the point of the war? I get why dragging Russia into a new quagmire is a big win for NATO, but is it really worth the amount of people dying? Russia's audience is going to call it a win because of all their state controlled propaganda. NATO's audience is going to call it a win because they all are equally as hooked on a propaganda narrative, and think they're stopping an evil empire from conquring the world, (the Russian military has proven itself to be no where near up to the task of that, so all the fear is being proven to have been irrational all along).

What's more, and regardless of how the war is actually going, it's been apparent for some time that Putin believes it's going reasonably well, and so he'd have no reason to declare mobilisation.

""For years before Russia invaded Ukraine in February, the Ukrainians had been growing frustrated with U.S. leadership. A former high-level Ukrainian official described U.S. policy to the country in this way: “You won’t let us drown, but you won’t let us swim.” Washington has earned this mixed reputation in the decades since Ukraine broke free from the Soviet Union in 1991. Although Ukraine saw the United States as an indispensable partner and greatly appreciated U.S. security and economic assistance, many Ukrainians were aggrieved that the United States remained reluctant to more fully and forthrightly support them in the face of Russian provocations and aggression—even following Ukraine’s pivot toward the West after the tumult of 2014, when protests toppled a pro-Russian government in Kyiv and Russia responded by annexing Crimea and invading the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. With few exceptions, Ukrainian pleas for increased military aid, greater economic investment, and a concrete road map for integration with Europe fell on deaf ears in Washington. The Ukrainians could not understand why the U.S. national security establishment continued to privilege maintaining stable relations with Russia—an irredentist and revanchist authoritarian state—over support for Ukraine, a democratic state that had made important strides in weeding out corruption and implementing democratic reforms.  


In the two months since Russia attacked Ukraine, the United States has thus far lived up to this ambivalent reputation. It has committed aid to Ukraine in fits and starts and has sought to avoid an escalation with Russia at the expense of more uncompromising support for Ukraine’s defense. But Washington can and should do more. The United States can shore up regional stability, global security, and the liberal international order by working to ensure a Ukrainian victory. To achieve this goal, Washington must finally abandon a failed policy that has prioritized trying to build a stable relationship with Russia. It needs to discard the desire—which seems to shape views on the National Security Council—to see Ukraine ultimately compromise with Russia for the sake of a negotiated peace. And the United States must give Ukraine the support it needs to bring this war to a close as soon as possible.""",e6091345ceb8252d5a09afcdce513ddac6f3b29a,True,False,,,,,0,1652295570,,0,{},i87y0lj,True,t3_unh54i,False,True,t3_unh54i,/r/geopolitics/comments/unh54i/alexander_vindman_america_must_embrace_the_goal/i87y0lj/,1652295589,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1652266770.0

Regardless, while some analysts may have suspected it, their (lack of) effectiveness wasn't apparent until Putin's invasion of Ukraine stalled, because true capabilities only become apparent when they're put to the test during wartime.

NATO has a unified command structure, but how well this operates during war time, especially against a near peer adversary, hasn't been tested yet. That's why their frequent joint exercises and training deployments are so important.

All bets are off if a nuke detonates in a major population center, which is what I imagine most people are thinking, but that's not the only way to use a nuclear weapon. It could be a tactical nuke. If it causes about the same casualties as a regular week of bombings, would that really trigger MAD even? Potentially. Probably I think, but that's not a definite thing.

If Russia did use a nuke in aggression in a more dramatic way it would be a declaration of World War. It would be the first move, not the only move. There is no logical scenario where Russia uses a nuclear weapon without Beijing being in agreement with them. It wouldn't be a matter of attracting NATOs ire, the theoretical nuclear first strikes would be on NATO targets, not Ukrainian ones. It would be about confronting NATO directly. Presumably supersonic missiles that we can't shoot down too well. They'd hit key targets while they're troops advance adjacent and potentially through nuclear fallout.

Without incident, nuclear sharing, or permanent bases, mind you. To the point where Russia had to invent hypotheticals to pretend that it actually felt threatened. The aforementioned countries were the ones that truly felt threatened, which is why they rushed to join Nato as soon as they possibly could, even in the face of Western doubt about their value to the alliance. Poland sent soldiers to Iraq, not because it believed in the mission, but to show the USA that it could be a partner. Indeed the attitude that those countries have no relevance or meaning outside of vaguely being on ""Russia's borders"", and that their fate should be imposed upon them by great powers, is exactly why they wanted to join. Russia never truly respected or assuaged their security interests, or made any compelling counteroffer to them. 

For the Cuban Missile Crisis comparison, there actually were Soviet missiles and thousands of Soviet soldiers on the island. It wasn't a hypothetical ""write in your constitution that you will forever be nuclear-free and won't genocide minorities or maintain meaningful defences and will give up your territorial integrity and sovereignty or we invade again"" situation. The USA also knew it had strategic supremacy; a USSR attack on Berlin was expected, but in any possible scenario (including strategic nuclear exchange) the USA would emerge net-ahead. Most everyone in Russia laughed at the idea that Russia would invade, precisely because it was such an obviously bad idea; even the Russian International Affairs Council, a think tank created by order of the Russian president, said that 'the costs far outweigh the benefits.'  The USA openly said ""we're going to DEFCON 2, we will invade, we are calling up the reserves""; Russia denied that it was planning to invade until it did invade, and then claimed that the invasion was a mere special military operation. Russia apologized for using conscripts, which implies that this isn't actually defensive.  The USA did not maintain that Cubans and Americans were 'one people' or deny the very legitimacy of a Cuban state, or muse breaking it up. It was further the height of the Cold War (and why would anyone want to return to that nightmare?); the contention between the USA and USSR was the wretched vortex formed by two mutually incompatible, totalistic systems which maintained that the other, if not stopped, would destroy everything of value.  Even the Russian government and Russian nationalists struggle to articulate what specifically the current strategic competition between Russia and the West (Zapad) is about.

Does it not make more sense that the dictator of a country with a failing economy, wide spread corruption and a population whos support of him was dropping constantly engineered a war to distract his people from problems at home and create an external enemy to bring them in line? Something that had already worked for him when he invaded Crimea in 2014.

Furthermore, Putin's unprovoked invasion resulted in the 10th largest agricultural producing nation being unable to harvest or ship their products, driving up the global prices for grains, sunflower oil and animal feed. Wheat prices are up 40%, corn 26% and sunflower oil up by over 60% since the war in Ukraine started so don't sit there and act like these price rises are not caused by a major producer being invaded by a hostile power. If you dont believe me please check Business Insider's commodity markets.

IMO, this war has laid bare the fact that NATO has for decades pursued arms that were designed to counter Russias armor to great effect. Unsurprisingly, NATO ATGMs work really, really well. At the same time, Russia has continued to adhere to a doctrine and battle order that modern ATGMs have made totally obsolete.

What we're seeing Russia fail at is the early phases of the conventional fight against a uniformed, soviet heritage (now a westernised hybrid), defense of a flat country. NATO or US efforts to accomplish things like that have been straightforward and brief. See opening phases of combat in Iraq. Though it would be made bloodier with some third party supplying intelligence, and powerful personal weapons, as Ukraine's backers are.

What western forces failed at in Afghanistan, and other places, is the counter-insurgency / nationbuilding / policing / pacification phase after the conventional victory. And not for nothing is it the phase that has no clear name or aim. Those experiences led some commentators to assume Russia would perform in a similar way as well - brief conventional victory followed by a costly insurgency.

Few currency boundaries are actually decided based on OCA criteria, and the convenience of being able to travel, transact and live anywhere is huge but hard to quantify. Instead, all they hear is all the hand-waiving about euroskepticism.

[],False,,TheShreester,,,[],,,,text,t2_qoluy,False,False,"&gt;This is all rooted in geography --- that's why it's called geopolitics.

It's called *geopolitics* because it's _politics influenced by geography,_ which you didn't mention or consider at all in your earlier comment, which I replied to. Indeed, it was I who pointed out that *geopolitical, rather than geographical* considerations are determining what and how much aid countries are providing. 

Nevertheless, while the influence of geography is an important consideration, it's not the only, or in some cases most significant, one. 

For example, geographically and hence geopolitically, Hungary is in a similar situation to Poland, yet political differences in the stances of their respective governments towards Putin's Russia are resulting in differing MILITARY responses to the war, even while both are willing to accept refugees and provide humanitarian aid. 

Also, as I already pointed out in my previous reply, the decision to provide arms is also influenced by both the military capability and economics of the country in question. 
 
Moldova is _geopolitically_ almost as vulnerable as Ukraine, due to its geographical location, but also because it's not a member of NATO and the eastern part of the country is occupied by Russian forces. However, Moldova is a much poorer (and smaller) country than Ukraine, so they're unable to provide military support, despite having the greatest motivation to do so, as they're the most likely target for Putin to invade after Ukraine.",6d38fb28dbdde4c758ee26261dcad0c376d75182,True,False,,,,,0,1652265041,,0,{},i860vxp,False,t3_uit848,False,True,t1_i85w3d8,/r/geopolitics/comments/uit848/why_isnt_there_a_larger_display_of_european/i860vxp/,1652265054,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1652236241.0

fers: “politics as influenced by geographic factors.” But neither of these definitions does much to explain what geopolitics is and how we use it at Geopolitical Futures.
For us, geopolitics is a tool, a way of thinking about the rela- tionship between what states can and cannot control. It is not focused on any one thing but on all things; not on any one mo- ment but on all moments, past and future; above all, it is not judgmental. It is concerned with describing what is and leaves what should be to theologians and think tanks.
Geopolitics is not something you can learn from books alone, though reading Thucydides and Machiavelli and Clausewitz and Alfred Mahan certainly doesn’t hurt. Geopolitics is more akin to common sense than to international relations theory. It requires you to understand why men die for their country as well as a country’s grand strategy. It requires that you know how much a loaf of bread costs at the grocery store as well as what kind of guidance system an ICBM needs to be effec- tive. It requires you to be able to put yourself in the shoes of a man like Adolf Hitler and understand his decisions with a cold and dispassionate accounting of Germany’s national interest.",199e6707aee163e21727b54859e78867fad8982c,True,False,,,,,0,1652262931,,0,{},i85y7md,True,t3_un698k,False,True,t3_un698k,/r/geopolitics/comments/un698k/geopolitics_101/i85y7md/,1652262945,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1652234131.0

[],False,,China_ate_my_cake,,,[],,,,text,t2_7xltsqkk,False,False,"No single man or even institution can truly conlcude on whether china's a paper tiger or not, since that remains to be seen. But what we can do is point at clear structural issues and weaknesses within the chinese state itself.

The most noteworthy and even existential issue they face is a demographic time bomb. The CCP figure for the country's fertility rate sits at 1.7 but take number with a grain of salt. It's far more likely that number rests close to 1.0. Remember this is the same country that capped fertility rate at 1 for 36 years and only ended that policy a meager 6 years ago. For reference a fertility rate of 2.1 is necessary to just maintain a population at it's current level. It's expected that China's population will shrink by half by the turn of this century.

A related issue to the previous one is the fact that they have an extremely limited pool for military conscription. Despite being home to 1.4 Billion people only a tiny fraction of that amount can truly be sent to war. This is again due to the one child policy. If every family only has a single child and thus heir, it doesn't take much thinking to realize that families are very reluctant to send their only child to war. This applies countrywide over all 1.4 Billion people.

They lack reliable allies. Just really take a look at what allies they have, North Korea: a state that uses missile tests as a way to beg for foreign aid, Pakistan: a geographic nightmare, the source of it's main river (the nations literal lifeline) is located in Indian territory and it's coastline is short enough to be blockaded with little effort. Russia: a fading power that's currently chewing it's teeth, economy and everything out in Ukraine and Iran: a country with so many structural flaws (that i can get into if you ask but would rather not) that it's a miracle it hasn't caved in on itself by now.

You've probably heard of the housing crisis in China. But that's only a symptom of a major structural flaw which is inherent in the system. For governers and bureaucrats advancement in their careers means being sent to Beijing to join the central government. And when promotions are decided based on yearly GDP growth of the region they handled, it leads to unsustainable growth, in the form of excessive borrowing and resource extraction. Eventually when no more money can be borrowed and all the resources are extracted the region falls into an economic depression. But the governers who caused this have nothing to worry for since they've already been promoted to Beijing for achieving 'record breaking economic growth'. In essense governers can bring about the eventual destruction of a region and they're only rewarded for it. So regions that are now in a state of bankruptcy have turned to unorthodox methods just to stay afloat. This includes encouraging GFVs to drive up housing prices to extract as much revenue from the general populus as possible. Which is where Evergrande came from.

If the the CCP fails to PROPERLY address these issues then China could fizzle out of relevance by the 2040s to 2050s this is about the time ehen the demographic crisis catches up with them. Now realize me highlighting the word PROPERLY there. The CCP has a bad habit of constantly 'addressing' a problem then declaring it fixed a short while later when it actually isn't. The most recent example of this happening is their campaigb against poverty. They declared a war against poverty, made themselves look good for a while then declared it 'fixed'. They have to actually fix these issues not just act as of they did.",8a0cb6a18f2a8841647a4cf0a1467b94fe0711c5,True,False,,,,,0,1652249088,,0,{},i85hj1j,False,t3_umn9vk,False,True,t3_umn9vk,/r/geopolitics/comments/umn9vk/xi_jingping_and_vladimir_putin_are_both_said_to/i85hj1j/,1652249099,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1652220288.0

By that logic the UK shouldn't be involved either as its further west than both Italy and Spain and neither should Sweden, yet both have sent thousands of NLAW anti tank weapons along with other arms and the UK has also been training the UA using military advisors.

While it's true that these countries do provide a land buffer for the rest of Europe (as does Ukraine), thks buffer only exists as long as they remain independent and is only good enough to buy time in the event of an invasion. 

The importance of defending them is evidenced by the foreign NATO  troops and NATO military bases in both the Baltic and Poland.

The reason why there ""only"" several thousand troops stationed in these countries is because NATO believes there's negligible chance of a land invasion by Russia and stationing large numbers of troops is expensive and logjtistically challenging (as a Putin is discovering for himself in Ukraine).",7a0a4a5b5eaafb4321fbc84e75e62d4a345ee67e,True,False,,,,,0,1652237892,,0,{},i84ya6x,False,t3_uit848,False,True,t1_i7gc22e,/r/geopolitics/comments/uit848/why_isnt_there_a_larger_display_of_european/i84ya6x/,1652237909,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1652209092.0
