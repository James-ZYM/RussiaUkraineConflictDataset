&gt;In a final case that is probably heading to a trial in absentia, a soldier named as Mikhail Romanov, who has a large tattoo of a bear on his chest, is accused of breaking into a house in March in a village in the Brovarsky region, murdering a man and then repeatedly raping his wife while “threatening her and her underage child with violence and weapons”. A second soldier also raped the 33-year-old woman, who has a four-year-old son.

&gt;The case is yet to be filed at court but the prosecutor’s office was able to provide a photograph from social media that has been used by the victim to identify the man who allegedly attacked her. Romanov’s apparent partner was contacted for comment by this newspaper but she did not respond to questions.

&gt;Of Romanov, Venediktova said: “Now we don’t know where he is – maybe he is fighting still, maybe he is on rotation in the Russian federation, maybe he is dead. We don’t know but we want to prosecute him in absentia.” She added: “We want to demonstrate to these criminals that we will find them. And we will prevent the deaths of other people in other territories.”",e490ac5d688a2a417077db67f8a12d1436ece55e,True,False,,,,,0,1652305287,,0,{},i88mo53,False,t3_una58k,False,True,t3_una58k,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/una58k/ukraine_prosecutors_ready_to_launch_first_war/i88mo53/,1652305301,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1652276487.0,

Right now they are countering in the North and pushing the Russian invaders back from Kharkiv which is great as there is a major supply line they can cutoff from Belgorod and allows them to dig in further up there and I assume move troops down to the east.

Honestly, if UA military is expected to counter attack and drive Russians back to the 2014 boarders by force, I think they will need a lot more combat troops and munitions. What has been supplied and deployed thus far has worked beyond expectation to blunt the invasion and created nothing short of a disaster for the Russian military, but it likely isn't enough to drive Russia out completely as is the stated goal by Zelensky. 

I think we are headed for more escalation unfortunately. If Russia begins to mobilize more troops, perhaps the West decides it is time to send a division into UA to relieve the troops in the North and West to join the fight in the South and the East. Or maybe UA and the West has been exclusively reactionary for the most part outside of the two counter attacks in the North and they decide to take the initiative and move troops in even before Russia decides to mobilize reinforcements.",8ea55be8e1678d3138f10165d499b163bb0852a8,True,False,,,,,0,1652300408,,0,{},i88afq1,False,t3_undrlh,False,True,t3_undrlh,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/undrlh/lets_hear_your_honest_assessment_of_the_war/i88afq1/,1652300426,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1652271608.0,

&gt; Three Russian prisoners of war accused of targeting or murdering civilians, and a soldier who allegedly killed a man before raping his wife, are set to be in the dock in the first war crimes trials of the Ukraine conflict, the Ukrainian prosecutor general has revealed.

&gt; More than 10,700 crimes have been registered since the war began by the office of Ukraine&amp;#039;s prosecutor general, led by Iryna Venediktova, and a handful of cases have now been filed or are ready to be submitted in what marks a watershed moment two months into the war.

&gt; At the end of March videos emerged of alleged war crimes committed by Ukrainian soldiers against Russian prisoners of war, including a film that appeared to show three soldiers being shot in the legs.

Meanwhile Ukraine started this conflict already in Castle Age and by now, with all the stuff from the US and other countries, they are at about 80% upgrading to the Imperial Age. There's no doubt in my mind who the winner will be.

Moreover, their relatives have already confirmed everything - in particular, the wives are now trying to contact Zelensky so that their husbands would be released on bail until waiting the trial.

[],False,,pezboy74,,,[],,,,text,t2_64h50ya5,False,True,"Well keep in mind it didn't get that way because of Ukraine - the borders of Ukraine and Moldova were decided by the Soviet Union, which was largely (though not only) run by the territory that makes up current day Russia and certainly by the political organizations that ran the Soviet Union.  
Also keep in mind, Ukraine did give some of its territory to Moldova after it gained its independence so Moldova would not be completely landlocked and unable to access sea trade, giving it the Port of Giurgiulești and access to the Danube and Prut rivers which have access to international sea trade. (it was technically a land trade but as I understand it Moldova never gave the territory it agreed to give - a road that runs between two Ukraine towns that crosses the Moldova border) Though yes that was a very small (but important to Moldova) piece of land.  
Do I think once the war is over if Ukraine regains all the territory along the Black Sea that it has lost during the 2022 invasion (and potentially Crimea, though that seems unlikely in my opinion) as part of the discussion to join the EU should the status of the Bolhrad Raion and Izmail Raion (the western 2/3rds of the part you circled) be discussed - I think that's fair - the area has a high Moldovian population, historical connections to Moldova and low Ukrainian population and it would vastly improve Moldova's access to international trade.   
But there's no way while Ukraine is being invaded by Russia should that discussion happen and if the worst happens and Russia continues to hold Mariupol and Ukraine's Sea of Azov shoreline, Ukraine is not going to be open (understandably so - given the devastation it's suffering) to even considering losing anymore of its Black Sea access regardless of the history of that area.  
Also - I did not mention the Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi Raion (the eastern more 1/3rd of the area you circled) as it is now very populated by people who view themselves as ethnic Ukrainian and despite Moldova having reasonable historical claims to the land - it's current situation I think prevents it from being considered as anything other than part of Ukraine.
