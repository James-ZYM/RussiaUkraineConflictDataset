The primary causes would be Ukraine's aim to take Crimea and the status of the 1,000,000+ Ukrainians that Russia has essentially kidnapped into their territory.

---

As things are right now, Russia is losing gear, and especially losing tanks. Russia cannot make more modern tanks at any reasonable rate, and they cannot wage war without tanks.

As Russia loses gear on net, and Ukraine gains gear, Ukraine's advantage will obviously grow and grow. Eventually, Ukraine is going to be able to take back the entire Donbas region- and according to their stated aims, they want to go for Crimea after that. While Crimea would be very hard to take directly, the whole peninsula could be partially sieged in principle. The Crimean Bridge can be destroyed, and Russia only has so many boats to go around and deliver supplies. As Ukraine destroys those boats, Crimea will become more and more isolated. Without resupply, the soldiers on the peninsula would eventually run out of ammo altogether.

Now, here's the big question: *What will Russia do in response?* Since 2020, the Russian Constitution has forbid ceding of territory. Russia legally considers Crimea to be its territory. As such, barring a change to their own Constitution, they're literally incapable of surrendering Crimea to Ukraine. So what would they do?

They *could* opt for a frozen conflict. In this scenario, they'd maintain that Crimea is theirs, and there would be constant tension even after the fighting stopped. Russia would constantly spew propaganda about how Ukraine and NATO are occupying Russian land, and Ukraine would carry on.

But there's another issue: the kidnapped Ukrainians. For Russia to agree to round them up and send them back to Ukraine would be politically unthinkable in a situation where their own land is """"occupied"""". Ukraine, however, can't tolerate such a thing; numerically, it'd be worth it to get those people back even if they had to grind their own army away. 

In the scenario where Russia is so drained that they can't even keep Crimea, Ukraine would be able to start pushing into Russia proper. This sounds insane, and it is insane in the sense of being unthinkable not long ago, but it would be a way to apply direct pressure to force Russia to bring back the civilians. Unfortunately, however, it would also bring Russia closer to using nukes than ever before.

If Russia uses a nuke on Ukraine, however small, the world changes. If the US nukes Russia back, even with just one nuke, there's a solid chance of nuclear Armageddon. If the only response is absolute global sanctions, that'll still establish a precedent of ""You'll live to tell the tale""- which is bad news in a world where places like Iran, Israel, Pakistan, and North Korea all have nuclear weapons and strong ideological foundations.

In short, the possibilities are:

- Ukraine takes back the Donbas, but not Crimea. Additionally, over a million Ukrainian citizens remain kidnapped by Russia, never to return home. In this ending, either morale or equipment gave out on the Ukrainian side before they could finish the job (which is unlikely).

- Ukraine takes back the Donbas, but not Crimea. In exchange for not taking Crimea, however, Russia agrees to send back the citizens. This is the best realistic outcome.

- Ukraine takes back all of their territory, including Crimea. There is a frozen conflict thereafter, and over a million Ukrainian citizens remain kidnapped by Russia, never to return home. This is a bittersweet ending.

- Ukraine takes back all of their territory, and forces Russia to give back its kidnapped citizens or risk continuing a devastating war/experiencing sanctions. This is the fairy tale outcome, but don't expect it.

- Ukraine takes back all of their territory, but pushes Russia into a corner. Russia uses a nuclear weapon, resulting in the conflict stopping for fear of nuclear annihilation. The world cuts off all trade with Russia over this, and hundreds of thousands are dead from the use of the nuke. This is the more likely ending if Ukraine pushes into Russia hard enough to push them into a corner.

- Ukraine takes back all of their territory and pushes Russia into a corner. Russia uses a nuclear weapon, then the US uses a nuclear weapon in retaliation. Russia realizes that this is going to go very poorly, and begrudgingly gives back the civilians (perhaps in exchange for reparative lifting of sanctions).

- Ukraine takes back all of their territory and pushes Russia into a corner. Russia uses a nuclear weapon, then the US uses a nuclear weapon in retaliation. There is a nuclear exchange, and everyone loses (Russia more than others). Who comes out on top after this depends on who can better mobilize their population to find alternative food sources between China and the US (Russia is a non-factor after a nuclear exchange- their cold environment would suffer more from a nuclear winter, and no one would give them any support).",6823636cb7ed6964ee4548449bfa7cb8c271a8a5,True,False,,,,,0,1652311311,,0,{},i890c49,False,t3_un86mu,False,True,t1_i86bluu,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/un86mu/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_11_2022/i890c49/,1652311327,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652282511.0,

Girkin himself is pretty explicit about the existence of a real political movement.

Or how you will easily move your advanced Cognito-supported user management system to AD or even better to a platform without auth service. Or how will Kubernetes help if you your data scientists were using a high-abstraction service with pre-defined models such as AWS Sagemaker?

I flat out mentioned the XVIII Corps numerous times, which is the only Big Army unit that is expeditionary and the only ones that were involved in Grenada and Panama, besides a mech infantry unit already stationed in Panama that literally drove a few miles to get involved. 

I didn't say just a MEU would be involved in anything, I've been using them as examples plus UDP units because at any given time 1/3 of active duty Marine Corps combat units are already forward deployed overseas somewhere waiting for a war to break out. All they need is transportation, which the MEUs already possess and the rest can be quickly arranged, which is why they're used to play second army instead of using the actual first Army.

Go look up every war since that system was set up in the late 50s and it'll prove I'm right. The only non SOCOM ground unit the Army keeps on an expeditionary status even remotely similar to the Marines is the 82nd, and even then they can't get the whole division overseas nearly as fast as the same number of Marines. The rest of the XVIII Airborne Corps isn't on a quick alert or deployment status, they don't have transportation for it nor are more units already finished with a combat train up to me 100% ready to deploy to war, which is what every Marine combat unit does during the train up before every pump.

The two examples you showed had large Marine presence for a reason. OP Desert Shield buildup saw faster Marine build up than Army for a reason, and actually equalled the Army until very last minute inclusion of V Corps from Germany.

**Arestovich claims UA forces cross the border into Russia**

https://twitter.com/NotWoofers/status/1524503256201891841

Currently no confirmation of this, but if this were to be true that would be a remarkable development in the war. On one hand, a massive success for the UA considering where this war was a month ago. On the other hand, this is a possibility that seems to play into Russia's hand on the surface and may make NATO warier.

My understanding is that this is probably a symbolic crossing so it isn't like the UA is trying to occupy any Russian territory, which means this is not as escalatory as it could be. The most interesting thing I take from this is that the Russian retreat from Kharkiv doesn't seem all that orderly if they can't defend the border after retreating. 

**Ukraine Forming New Units**

https://twitter.com/Militarylandnet/status/1524492724333854720

Interesting from a few perspectives. First, this likely means the UA has a reserve of equipment big enough that they are still adding manpower to their force, rather than conserving it and allocating scarce resources to existing units. This probably also means that supply shortages at the front, as have been reported in Donbas, are probably artifacts of logisics issues and not an overal shortage of material.

Long-term, this is interesting because Russia's mission becomes much harder if the UA is able to bring more of its manpower online. Ukraine has ~900,000 reservists and who knows how many other able-bodied men and women who can be trained and equipped. Russia obviously could overmatch Ukraine by mobilizing themselves, but that looks unlikely at this juncture.

**More Info About Bilohorivka River Crossing Attempt**

https://twitter.com/ALanoszka/status/1524484171225305095

Nothing much to say here other than the amount of photographed destroyed Russian equipment is staggering. Unclear at this point if Russians are still operating on the other side of the river, but even if they are, the cost to cross and hold would not be worth it alone. If the Russians actually get repelled over the river, it seems like a foregone conclusion that they will not cross at any point in the near future.

**UA SHeeling Belgorod Area**

https://twitter.com/NotWoofers/status/1524446123041202176

The village of Solokhoi is supposedly being evacuated with civilians dying in UA shelling today. The helicopter raid a few weeks ago was a daring and incredible operation, but with the Kharkiv front collapsed, Russian territory is probably going to get shelled daily now. Considering the Belgorod is the main staking area of all Russian forces in the region, this probably presents some level of a logistical problem for the Russians.

**UA M777 Destroys Russian 2C3 Akatsia in Artillery Duel**

https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1524490577940783104

From what I know, this is the first real evidence we've seen of Western-provided UA artillery targeting Russian guns. Russia may have the artillery advantage still, but the UA now has modern guns, counter-battery radars, and US-made PGMs. The UA has also proven to me more effective in directing strikes through drones and such, which the Russian Army continues to struggle with. I'm not sure what the balance of artillery is in the field right now, but there is a very real possibility that Russia's main advantage in the war to this point will start to slip as UA artillery begins to pick apart Russian formations.",14cd9fbe82210edcd844a13ab86cc10a8d884bc3,True,False,,,,,0,1652307005,,0,{},i88qq4o,False,t3_un86mu,False,True,t3_un86mu,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/un86mu/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_11_2022/i88qq4o/,1652307019,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652278205.0,

I tend to agree and recently I realized that while Russia might still look big and scary and discuss nuking the UK on TV, in fact they are going to slowly deescalate. There will be no mobilization, no new offense and no annexations. While they stole some land, corn and 1M people, they are in fact scared as hell, they are yet to learn how to survive sanctions, many production sites in Russia are still closed and their military campaign doesn't have any good options left as many of you already noted here. Luckily they don't need to finish this campaign with some big victory announcement, Russians have short memory and will quickly forget the goals of the campaign. They are fine with this slowly ongoing conflict since it allows them to talk about patriotism on TV, blame the West/NATO/enemies. It allows them to fill the ideological vacuum.

Based on the lack of any action on May 9th, I think Putin is still wary of the political calculations surrounding escalating the war. It's entirely possible that Belgorod ends up being a PR disaster for him, with Russians questioning the competence of the armed forces and a gocerment that allowed Russian territory to become a battlefield in a conflict they started.

What if that country sanctions you. Or they use their influence over you caused by the economic ties in other ways.

For example, did Germany declining to buy US LNG and instead buying their gas from Russia put them in a better position in terms of entanglement free foreign policy ?

Are the belt and road countries taking their investments from China instead of the US finding that has magically free'd their infrastructure from malign foreign influence ?

Some DCS players ran a few simulations of the Moskva sinking  based on the stated capabilities of the cruiser and the description of the attack.

Their conclusion was that the Moskva SHOULD have been able to defend itself from the Neptune missiles if it's systems were operating nominally.  They don't have any definitive answers, but it is likely that either systems were not working as they are supposed to work, or there were crew failures.

A dug-in enemy is not going to be dislodged through light infantry alone, even if mechanised. 

With artillery, it's still not easy to defeat entrenched defenders - especially if they've had time to dig proper trenches and build fortifications - and, most importantly, you still need infantry on the ground to sweep in and clear out what's left regardless. Dumb artillery shells cannot safely be fired in close proximity of your infantry - and the fancy guided shells which may be more capable of that are very expensive. After firing 50 of those shells, you've probably spent as much as you would on a tank.

The same thing applies to air power - with the additional caveat that it's really, really, *really* difficult to use airpower in the way that the US does. I'm sure some of the better equipped Western airforces + China + maybe Japan, could use their airpower successfully in support of an infantry attack - but as we've seen with Russia's issues, it's exceptionally resource intensive, and a well planned air defence system can really dampen the utility of airpower - and if it's your main method of supporting infantry advances, you'll be leaving your soldiers as sitting ducks. That's not even mentioning the eye-watering cost of the guided munitions and planes - if one F-35 gets downed then that's probably the cost of 10 tanks (more with the value of pilots).

Basically, you ideally want artillery, armour, and airpower, all working in conjunction with your infantry. If you're missing any of them then you will be weakened. The US can compensate for its relative lack of artillery (vs. the Russians) with its ridiculously large air force, but that's not an option for basically any other country. They, however, could still not entirely compensate for a lack of armour. Tanks bring their massive guns right onto the battlefield - you don't need to call in CAS or artillery, and can fire at a threat in seconds of spotting it. There's much less risk of miscommunication from the infantry on the ground regarding target acquisition, and it provides support to the infantry 'in the moment' when assaulting.

As the other commentor said, there is still tremendous utility in bringing a huge gun right onto the battlefield, in an armoured and mobile package. It may be that tanks have never been more vulnerable, but they still serve a purpose that can't be replicated by anything else we have at the moment. perhaps in future there'll be such an abundance of loitering munitions with big enough firepower that soldiers can call in on targets at a moments notice, that tanks will no longer be needed - but for now, they fulfill a need at a relatively low cost.",08c4441d0156aa46a69cc8f2f5446bb30edb7c04,True,False,,,,,0,1652303085,,0,{},i88h7km,False,t3_un86mu,False,True,t1_i8821v9,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/un86mu/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_11_2022/i88h7km/,1652303103,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652274285.0,

I’m not interested in your psycho-analysis of my benign statement. I’m interested in the material facts of the situation and those are that there is a strong seperatist element in Eastern Ukraine which Russia has been using to their advantage since 2014 to support their war efforts. 

&gt; And both of those things are not true, and in fact eastern Ukraine has become steadily more hostile to Russia since 2014.

This statement just isn’t true. [This Al Jazeera article, written in 2022, goes into depth on pro-Russian attitudes in certain Eastern Ukrainian cities:](https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2022/4/21/whats-behind-pro-russian-attitudes-in-eastern-ukraine)

&gt; “Our electorate is pro-Russian,” Sergey Vaganov, a 63-year-old retired photographer from Mariupol, told Al Jazeera. “No major Ukrainian party even tried to work here, honestly. No one was fighting for the voters.”

&gt;Mariupol, the southernmost city of the Donetsk region, was briefly occupied by separatists in 2014 and became the region’s de-facto administrative capital when Ukraine regained control, but failed to win hearts and minds.

You claim that Eastern Ukraine became more hostile to Russia after 2014 yet Mariupol was literally taken over by separatists that year. 

&gt; Meanwhile, in some of Ukraine’s eastern towns and villages, years of “brainwashing” made many youngsters vehemently anti-Ukrainian, a displaced woman from Donetsk said.

&gt;”An entire generation that hates Ukraine with every cell of their body grew up there in the past eight years,” Oksana Afenkina, who fled for Kyiv in 2020 after receiving death threats, told Al Jazeera.

I know that a lot of people here despise hearing any news that confirms anyone in the Donetsk or Luhansk regions actually supports seceding from Ukraine but you have to face reality. These seperatists didn’t spring from nowhere in 2014.

&gt; Ukrainian prosecutors charged Struk with separatism, but he returned to Kreminna – and was elected its mayor last November with nearly 52 percent of the vote.

How about amphibious operations. The counteroffensive amphib landing at Wonsan etc that would trigger the KPA to retreat if they cross the DMZ in force. I'm sure you think the 82nd could handle those, right? 

And before you argue those landings aren't needed you better look up why the ROK has Marines too.

&gt;Are you trying to argue that the US would send the marines to single handily attempt a regime change through military force?

No, I'm arguing that if the US wanted to rapidly deploy forces anywhere in the world and use more than a few US Army light infantry battalions with almost no combat support, they'd need to use Marines.

I do think that of all the official figures, Arestovich is the most reliable one for real news, as he's not shied away from admitting Ukrainian difficulties before. Some of the more interesting tidbits from the last few days:

* Few days ago he got very annoyed that while Biden signed Lend-Lease act, nothing is coming until the $40bn bill is passed which won't be until close to end of May. But then he quickly recomposed himself and thanked the US again for their support. To me, this indicates a general frustration on dependent they are on US support. Very likely that UKR can't conduct counteroffensives until US aid arrives.

* Claims that Russian mobilisation is happening, but in secret. Not quite sure if he's reliable on this one tbh (maybe he's just getting wrong intel?). Coming from the point above he sees it as a race against time for UKR to go on the offensive before RU reserves come in.

* He admits that the defense of Kherson was a huge shit show but it was most likely a mix of incompetence and malice rather than just malice.

First, super expensive and very limited number of missiles that can be used in rocket artillery launchers can be used against ships. 

Second, tube arty can be used against other things than ships, the types of things that the US has needed to use the Marine Corps for the last century that didn't involve containing but not actually fighting China because who the flying fuck cares about the South China Sea if that war actually starts.

Because that's what we're really talking about. What the Marines are destroying their small war, COIN, and conventional warfare capabilities to do isn't actually fighting China, it's an escalation of a containment policy just short of war.

&gt;More drones vs manned aircraft is a good thing.

Drones that the Marines are buying are for ISR, not air superiority, not for air transport. 

&gt;The Marines keeping conventional land-war equipment simply doesn't make sense.

Right, because the US didn't need to rapidly deploy Marine arty to a combat zone only a few years ago to shoot more rounds than it has since Vietnam.

You want to talk needing tanks too and how incredibly useful they've been in every USMC operation since WW2 [like seen here](https://youtu.be/_DBmNuyvfSw)?

Fuck it, let's gut all that to set up for a fictional war so POTUS can contemplate escalation of US containment of China in a way that changes nothing strategically in war because control of the South China Sea doesn't matter one bit in a US vs PRC shooting war, which will not only be a trade war that will destroy the US economy but almost surely go nuclear as well.

Democracies aren't equal, many of the transitional democracies  are quite authoritarian because while they hold elections, their institutions don't reform. Zelensky was able to shut down multiple TV stations. BIden might hate Fox news and Trump might have hated CNN but, they can't shut them down. That's the strength of the institutions that back democracy in America.  Russia became democratic, had the institution reformed we wouldn't be where we are today.

While a case can be made for getting the borders back, I think Biden miscalculated Putin's hold on Russia when he called for a regime change. It was a huge blunder because, when a leader loses in Russia, he is exiled or killed. Ruble hasn't collapsed, Putin hasn't been killed and I do believe that Europeans have made it clear that they don't want a North Korea on their borders.  If Biden persists, the European unity will break. 

Draghi has told him that they want to see preparations for an end to war, it's backed by Macron. Ukraine's threat to stop gas to Europe hasn't gone down well. It is beginning to seem that there's a sense that Zelensky's stature that was raised by the West to show solidarity against Russia has started to go his head. The West would want to stop him from painting himself into a corner. 

If you look at history Churchill lost the election after WW2. Look up CNN, the messaging from the Govt. is already softening. You hardy see any news about Ukraine. I do think that chances of a nuclear strike has gone up considerably. It doesn't have to be a big strike, Nuclear Artillery or a tactical nuke will make the situation more complicated.

At some point we will have to have a negotiated settlement. I doubt it will go back to 2014 borders. If you want to see Putin prosecuted then you will notice that Bush didn't get prosecuted for Iraq and Xi hasn't been prosecuted for Xinjang genocide. As much as it sucks, Putin won;t get prosecuted. I do hope that the war strengthens the Army to the point that they tale some of the power back from the FSB/KGB cabal. These are the fuckers who got the world into this mess.

The bigger question is how did tactics change to account for this change. Basically, it comes down to adequate support from surrounding units. Tanks don’t operate alone, well, exempting idiots. They usually operate in tandem with mechanized infantry and the IFVs and utility vehicles associated with said units. In larger groups, air support such as helicopters or drones may also be deployed ahead of the already deployed units to spot and engage targets. The more eyes in the group, the less chances the enemy gets an opportunity to attack. The Russians clearly did not get the memo that maintaining situational awareness of the surrounding area is paramount.

On convoy routes, you need to patrol the route beforehand to minimize the risks the incoming convoy will face. The units in the convoy must be continuously observing their surrounding to identify potential threats and engage them as necessary. Not staring forward like nothing is wrong. This alone makes the difference, infantry boots-on-the-ground support or not. In combat, the combat units have to work with cohesion with each unit supporting the other. Tanks neutralize the targets that the infantry can’t take on so that the infantry can advance. In return, infantry have to create a sort of “perimeter” around the general vicinity of the tank and engage threats to the tank as need be. Although, the infantry have a limited sight range, this can be somewhat countered by optics whether it be the optics on your firearm or binoculars. And as previously said, air support can also provide situational awareness. However, these measures are far from foolproof.

This is why Active Protection Systems or APS are being developed. If you can’t engage the enemy before they fire that ATGM, at least you can neutralize the missile and proceed to engage whoever launched that missile if they haven’t skedaddled away by then.",f3057b05c42fb821c30eb2db0d2b994a6504b38c,True,False,,,,,0,1652298236,,0,{},i884v5z,False,t3_un86mu,False,True,t1_i87ws74,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/un86mu/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_11_2022/i884v5z/,1652298247,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652269436.0,

&gt;
&gt;The problem of course is that most of the 'pro russian' ukrainians are or were in fact pro ukrainian... they just happen to speak russian or have historically endorsed closer relations.. you might as well just call russian speakers traitors, which for some at least is probably the goal. The parties that have been banned have all openly come out against the war. This idea that any 'pro-russian' party or politician in ukraine is a kremlin mouthpiece is all kinds of ludicrous. Historic broad political positions are not the same as current ones, and the 'pro russian' oligarchs are much more 'pro my money/ business interests which rely on an independent ukraine' than anything else.
&gt;
&gt;You could in fact argue that it makes people *more likely* to try and help russia by betraying their fellow citizens. By ostracising people like that many may start to think 'well what's the point. might as well live in a country that doesn't hate me'. Though maybe i'm stretching somewhat

I don't believe for a second that being Russian speaking is enough to be targeted in Ukraine. Everyone, especially in the east of Ukraine, speaks Russian, there aren't any non-Russian speakers around to oppress the Russian speakers. They're being targeted because they want closer ties with Russia, and that makes people angry because Russia is invading their country and killing their loved ones.

As far as I'm aware, there wasn't any substantial opposition to Russia before 2014, so historical support of Russia isn't a basis for being targeted either. The Ukrainian government is full of previous supporters of Russia who stopped supporting Russia after the 2014 invasion. It's current support that puts you at risk. This doesn't mean extrajudicial killings are a good thing, but it's one of those things that happened during wars. The blame goes to the side starting the way.

&gt;I just hate the 'good/bad' stuff. The world is all sorts of shades of grey. Throwing politicised narratives on top of already hyper politicised narratives doesn't help anyone. If I were still in the EU i wouldn't want ukraine to join any time close to soon. I don't want them to join nato particularly either. We've already got enough bullshit with the likes or erdogan and orban as you've mentioned.
&gt;
&gt;in 2014 there was supposed to be a 'government of national unity' to deal with the divisions behind maidan. Then Yanukovych was essentially forced out of the country and an unconstitutional coup took place whilst armed protestors roamed around outside parliament and the security forces had withdrawn. Instead of a unity government there to 'bring people together like the lovely west-leaning democratic country we are' the nationalists seized power. On their first day they voted to remove russian as an official language...... hardly the effort of a government trying to bring everyone together and build bridges... and a strong indication of what their priorities were. The 'russian invasion' and everything else stemmed from their extreme efforts to use their unconstitutionally seized power to completely reorient the country and sideline the russian minority. They then of course went around murdering yanukovych's ministers,  trying to have anti-maidan protestors arrested, trying to have autonomous crimea subjugated once again etc etc.

Again you're bringing up 2014 events. Where was this violence before the invasion? It's never going to be surprising that Ukrainians don't like Russians or Russian supporters after Russia invaded their country.

&gt;I guess my main concern is that we see a repeat, but far more extreme once this whole debacle is over. But by your logic it was fine for serbs to kill kosovans. After all, the US invaded and the kosovans liked them. I struggle to see how supporting secession is laudible when we do it for a random country we don't actually care about, but a heinous invasion when it's someone we don't like doing it for peoples they are literally related to.

That's a very different situation. The Serbia Kosovo conflict was a long-standing dispute over Kosovo that arguably has been going on for hundreds of years. It developed into violence without the need for outside assistance from anyone else, unless you want to count the imperial powers involved in the region for those preceding hundreds of years. In the immediate build up to the war, Kosovo terrorists attacked Serbians, who retaliated against the Kosovo population. I'm inclined to blame both sides for how that started. Then NATO intervened in an attempt to stop the violence, which is less blameworthy than starting it.

I don't think that's a great example of blameworthy foreign interference. I think a better example is Afganistan, where the US went in on a poorly thought out nation building exercise, successfully dismantled the previous government, and then spent the next 20 years falling to create anything to replace it, causing countless deaths in the process. The US had a fair interest in Afghanistan after 9/11, but they should have addressed it in a different way that didn't cause so much collateral damage. If you break it you own it.

The invasions of Crimea and the Donbas look a lot more like Afganistan than Kosovo. Instead of an organic independence movement in either location, the hostilities began as a result of Russian interference. The predictable results of that belong to Russia. If they didn't like what was happening there, Russia should have used soft power instead of escalating the situation to violence.",40b0a060aa88a498b7a887512785729b57cd4802,True,False,,,,,0,1652295618,,0,{},i87y4yv,False,t3_umh1p3,False,True,t1_i87rioj,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/umh1p3/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_10_2022/i87y4yv/,1652295634,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652266818.0,

But it does have many key details of Indian expansion the Indian Ocean and increasing diplomatic drives for security of the last few years. I have included some quotes but this website has many interactive tools and satellite images, so I suggest taking a glance at it.

Quotes:

&gt; * While not every planned upgrade has gone through in the years since, India has more than made up for individual setbacks by broadening and deepening defense ties with many of its most important maritime partners and securing a stake in several critical maritime infrastructure projects in the region. 

&gt; * Taken together with modest improvements to India’s own offshore bases, these steps represent substantial movement from New Delhi along a trajectory that would position India as the beating heart of a maritime security network in the Indian Ocean.

&gt; * Despite setbacks in improving its own offshore facilities, India has made substantial progress in boosting joint capabilities with partners in the Indian Ocean.

&gt; * …India constructed a 10,000-foot runway on Agalega in 2020, dwarfing the previous airstrip, as well as a jetty and significant new facilities construction at the northern end of the island. …progress can be seen on hangars along the runway which measure 180 feet long and 200 feet wide—big enough to house large military aircraft such as India’s P-8I Poseidon…

&gt; * …India signed a $500 million deal in 2021 for the Greater Male Connectivity Project, an infrastructure project involving the construction of a four-mile bridge and causeway connecting the Maldives’ capital Malé with three neighboring islands. Called the largest ever infrastructure project in the Maldives… 

&gt; * Sri Lanka has also been the target of Indian strategic outreach.

&gt; * While less tangible than India’s basing and port projects, some of the most significant recent steps New Delhi has taken to secure its leadership in the Indian Ocean have been diplomatic moves toward strengthening its relationships with other major maritime powers beyond its immediate neighborhood.

And it would be wrong, but it wouldn't be surprising, it members of Sinn Fein got murdered or lynched. War is ugly and these sorts of things happen.

I guess i'm just naive and hoped we'd moved on from the domestic atrocities of world war two where people were beaten, deported, stuck in camps etc due to 'perceived' allegiance, even if it had nothing to do with anything.

The problem of course is that most of the 'pro russian' ukrainians are or were in fact pro ukrainian... they just happen to speak russian or have historically endorsed closer relations.. you might as well just call russian speakers traitors, which for some at least is probably the goal. The parties that have been banned have all openly come out against the war. This idea that any 'pro-russian' party or politician in ukraine is a kremlin mouthpiece is all kinds of ludicrous. Historic broad political positions are not the same as current ones, and the 'pro russian' oligarchs are much more 'pro my money/ business interests which rely on an independent ukraine' than anything else.

You could in fact argue that it makes people *more likely* to try and help russia by betraying their fellow citizens. By ostracising people like that many may start to think 'well what's the point. might as well live in a country that doesn't hate me'. Though maybe i'm stretching somewhat

&gt; Russia invaded in 2014, so I blame Russia for this too. Get me some pro-Russians murdered in 2013 and I'll blame Ukraine for those.

The problem is they literally wanted to remain in ukraine. Just a federal ukraine where their *democratically* elected government wouldn't be overthrown on the basis that it represented them...

&gt; At the end of the day though, they were a democracy and they got invaded. That's really all it takes to make them the good guys in my book.

I just hate the 'good/bad' stuff. The world is all sorts of shades of grey. Throwing politicised narratives on top of already hyper politicised narratives doesn't help anyone. If I were still in the EU i wouldn't want ukraine to join any time close to soon. I don't want them to join nato particularly either. We've already got enough bullshit with the likes or erdogan and orban as you've mentioned.

in 2014 there was supposed to be a 'government of national unity' to deal with the divisions behind maidan. Then Yanukovych was essentially forced out of the country and an unconstitutional coup took place whilst armed protestors roamed around outside parliament and the security forces had withdrawn. Instead of a unity government there to 'bring people together like the lovely west-leaning democratic country we are' the nationalists seized power. On their first day they voted to remove russian as an official language...... hardly the effort of a government trying to bring everyone together and build bridges... and a strong indication of what their priorities were. The 'russian invasion' and everything else stemmed from their extreme efforts to use their unconstitutionally seized power to completely reorient the country and sideline the russian minority. They then of course went around murdering yanukovych's ministers,  trying to have anti-maidan protestors arrested, trying to have autonomous crimea subjugated once again etc etc.

I guess my main concern is that we see a repeat, but far more extreme once this whole debacle is over. But by your logic it was fine for serbs to kill kosovans. After all, the US invaded and the kosovans liked them. I struggle to see how supporting secession is laudible when we do it for a random country we don't actually care about, but a heinous invasion when it's someone we don't like doing it for peoples they are literally related to.",37210ab0453a88bd1e3733822a65d18cea8afc65,True,False,,,,,0,1652292993,,0,{},i87rioj,False,t3_umh1p3,False,True,t1_i87ieuq,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/umh1p3/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_10_2022/i87rioj/,1652293008,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652264193.0,

&gt;
&gt;Turning a desire for closer relations with another country into a treasonable offence is extremely problematic in any country that pretends to care at all about democracy, but then again Zelensky seemingly turned away from democracy the moment he lost his poll lead last year and started having his opponents arrested. Now he's banned basically every party that isn't right wing and vehemently nationalist! YAY... i guess. There's a very convenient coalescing of the opportunity to deal with both genuine 'traitors' (is wanting to not be at war treachery?) and also permanently eradicate an entire (completely valid) political identity under the guise of 'national security'. 

Are these the same political parties who the 'mayors' in the Russian occupied portions of the country are coming from?

If Ireland invaded northern Ireland tomorrow, I wouldn't expect Britain to allow Sinn Fein to continue participating in the Irish government while the war was going on. And it would be wrong, but it wouldn't be surprising, it members of Sinn Fein got murdered or lynched. War is ugly and these sorts of things happen.

&gt;they weren't giving people 'due process' before all this either. They basically continue to ignore the [mass murder](https://ukraine.un.org/en/126054-7-years-no-answers-what-lacking-investigations-events-odesa-2-may-2014) of 'pro federalist' ukrainians in 2014...

Russia invaded in 2014, so I blame Russia for this too. Get me some pro-Russians murdered in 2013 and I'll blame Ukraine for those.

&gt;Frankly the country comes across as a corrupt cesspit, and the current political class - despite the western media narrative - are only different from the previous ones in that they are unashamedly pandering to western ideals. At the end of the day the only people who suffer are the ordinary citizens, but i really hate the way we completely ignore the very real political and social problems/ divisions in ukraine just because we think it might harm russia. Ukraine are the victims, but i'm not sure their government are in any way 'the good guys'. Strikes me that Zelensky is either extremely weak or beholden to other interests. He's clearly uncomfortable with likes of Azov for example, but feels unable to criticise them. He's repeatedly rolled back on all his big campaign pledges and trended towards the status quo. This war ironically probably saved his presidency.

I'm in agreement that there's a lot not to like about Ukrainian politics. While we are at it I don't much like Polish or Turkish politics either, since they're in the neighborhood. Both of those countries are looking rather authoritarian to me. Ukraine seemed to me to be more corruption and a dash of anarchy as opposed to authoritarianism though.

Marines need amphibious vehicles that can provide direct fire support and immediate anti air/anti missile protection (same chassis, different turret).  And ideally robotic/drone AAVs that can swim ashore and automatically deploy anti air radars or missile batteries or supplies.  Once ashore, each Marine unit is going to need to be able to withstand enemy attack and hold the island for an extended period while reinforcements flow in to repair runways and upgrade radars and anti missile defenses.  

I don’t think there’s that much role for the Army in much of the Pacific. Seabees can repair captured islands and a small team of Marines can managed networked and highly automated radar/missile defenses systems.  Fighting over each island should be short lived, and then the next ship/group of Marines will leapfrog forward until the South China Sea is a solid wall of missiles and radar systems.  From there, US aircraft could strike the mainland or simply conduct a blockade until China yields.

Does nobody here understand how a basic conversation works?

You can't just keep making assertions, ignoring my points and then refusing to justify your position. All you've done is engage in personal attacks.

You dismiss evidence with a snide remark but refuse to explain yourself (presumably because you're hoping that acting like a cocky prick masks your lack of argument).

You engage in yet more snide remarks where you clearly don't understand the nuance of the language being used, and after i clarify it all you can do is deflect and engage in more personal attacks.

It's pathetic. I'm still waiting for you to elucidate... well... literally anything.

&gt;&gt; These are both treaty organizations that sovereign countries can withdraw from any time they want (see Great Britain) so that isn’t giving up sovereignty.

False. I've explained why... at length.

&gt;&gt; Being in a treaty organization where you get invaded if you pull out (see Crimea) is a loss of sovereignty. Entering into a treaty organization that you can resign from is not.

False. You just repeated yourself with a weird argument.

&gt;&gt; That you are trying to frame this decision as a “loss of sovereignty” is serious mental gymnastics on your part.

&gt;&gt; Entering into a voluntary agreement is not synonymous with loss of sovereignty.

False yet again. You just repeated yourself a third time without being able to explain anything.

&gt;&gt; Yes, it is. A country gives its consent to a treaty which can be withdrawn at any time. There is no “technically” to it. Annexation is a permanent loss of sovereignty.

Bemusing strawman about annexation for some reason. Again ignoring all my points.

&gt;&gt; I love it how you just elide the important bits of the Costa judgement.

Change of tact. Just a vague hint at you being right but refusing to offer anything further.

Yet more snide attacks about something you clearly don't understand. Again refuse to actually justify literally anything you've written (because you're 100% wrong and you can't)

Why is this surprising?

Nearly everyone in the US govt, who had been training, advising, arming the Ukrainians for years, giving them up to date intelligence, fully knowing their capabilities, basically begging them to activate their reserves before the war started, thought Ukraine were going to get steamrolled in days. That's why they offered Zelensky the ride out on Day 2, it wasn't because they were confident the Ukrainians would survive.

The insanity isn't that the Russians underestimated the Ukrainians, the US did that too. It's how much the Russians underestimated them, the utter lack of seriousness they took for this invasion, and that their strategic and operational planning hinged on that terrible assessment, all the way down to the tactical level there was almost no consideration made that they might encounter legit resistance.

This article says not everyone in the Russian general staff agreed there would be no resistance. If so, why the fuck didn't anyone unofficially warn the OSKs that despite the intelligence estimation they should still be vigilant? That would have trickled down to the CAAs to the combat units, a warning that while the political leadership doesn't think the UA will resist, it's best not to get complacent because they might fight back.

That's exactly what was said during OIF. Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld etc were saying they wouldn't fight back. Tommy Franks was kinda buying it. The other 2-3 stars under him weren't, they weren't taking chances, so everyone rolled in expecting the worse.

If they can't do that then the general staff are all eunuchs terrified of even unofficially challenging the regime, which deserves its own article as to why a bunch of nutless pussies hold positions of power in the MOD and how that can be exploited.

&gt;I think large parts of the Bush administration sincerely believed the US would be greeted as liberators in OIF

For the most part they were right. That's why it took 21 days to overthrow the Saddam regime, there was hardly any resistance even from the military, who largely deserted. 

The intelligence estimate they fucked up was that there would be no resistance afterwards during an occupation they barely even considered because they didn't really get that far into planning.The Sunni Arab insurgency started as remnants of the Saddam govt months later, with the Shia insurgency not starting until a year later.

I'm pretty sure that discussing the issue of sovereignty and how it works is pretty core to foreign policy and defence. The term 'give up their sovereignty' has a vast array of interpretations as is apparent in the replies. I was just making an off-hand throwaway comment to point out the irony of the source comment. No idea how it's devolved into such a mess.

It *was* a tangential point, but also an important one and one that hits home given i'm well versed in how the term is misused and misunderstood. Must say i never imagined i'd be arguing from the other side and having to convince people that EU membership impinges on national sovereignty, but there you go.

&gt; But what we're talking about here is the difference between Ukraine getting to elect its leaders or having a Moscow-controlled puppet government.

Well see that's not at all what i read from that comment in the slightest and if that's the implication it's also extreme and doesn't fit my own comment it's in reply to. The only reasonable way i interpreted it was suggesting that by abandoning NATO accession they'd be giving up their sovereignty, hence why i pointed out that they'd be losing sovereignty either way.

&gt;  Your nuance just doesn't come into play when we're talking about such a vast difference in sovereignty as Ukraine faces. If losing a sliver of sovereignty by joining NATO is the cost to avoid the catastrophic loss of sovereignty due to a puppet government, that's a no brainer.

I would expect big players such as banks to already be using their own hardware for critical applications, but I can't think of a single company I've worked with where removing their hosting platform wouldn't completely cripple the business overnight.

a loss of sovereignty is not the same thing as 'losing *your* sovereignty'. As i have repeatedly clarified.

Seems you may be the one struggling with the nuances of the English language?

You can lose sovereignty whilst remaining sovereign. The distinction comes from the implied level of loss, which is admittedly something that non-native speakers may struggle with. Sovereignty is an uncountable noun; there is not 'one sovereignty', nor 'two sovereignties'.... there is only sovereignty as a concept.

If i lose weight i do not become weightless do I? If i lose rice, then i have not run out of rice. The same applies to sovereignty. However if you lose *your* rice, then the implication is that the loss is total.

Another poster already mentioned that a lot of what you mentioned was already happening, so I'll address this paragraph, which has some pretty serious flaws in reasoning.

&gt;It is very easy from our point of view to see it as justified but how many other viewpoints would view it as economic terrorism.

That's the nature of foreign policy. One man's economic freedom fighter is another man's economic terrorist. We can either a) stop enforcing foreign policy via economics (something few countries do, because that pretty much leaves espionage or violence as your only stick). Or b) stop enforcing foreign policy goals entirely unless we have formalized treaties, which is a very inflexible (read: dangerous) and politically unrealistic path that no other country engages in.

&gt;Unless there is a treaty in place to defend Ukraine against Russian aggression anything that is done to bring the conflict to an end is by default completely voluntary, so what is to stop the west from crippling a country ""just because it started trending on Twitter"".

I already mentioned the treaty aspect of this. So, what is to stop the West from doing that? A ton of vested economic and diplomatic interests. If you look at the history of the West and sanctions, there really isn't much of a tendency for them to act in a coordinated and effective manner even when they arguably should. Most ethnic cleansings go relatively unpunished (unless it happens to catch cause celebre status). Most coups, most rigged elections. Even Russia's annexation in 2014 got mostly a slap on the wrist in response - and Europe was still selling them arms. The idea that suddenly we'll be sanctioning over Twitter beefs is *far* from reality. 

And that's because most of these countries have a ton of economic interests with one another, and unless there's a meaningful, sustained popular movement for sanctions, those economic interests win out. That dynamic isn't going away.

But by curbing the option for flexible economic intervention, you're limiting the nonviolent responses the West is capable, which carries inherent risk that more violent means of escalation fills that gap.",af80024c23f15ff9b5b8dd2524ab5e440350d796,True,False,,,,,0,1652285141,,0,{},i877b8q,False,t3_un86mu,False,True,t1_i86xzwl,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/un86mu/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_11_2022/i877b8q/,1652285157,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652256341.0,

Being decried as the enemy and murdered by the state for nothing more than not supporting the status quo goes well beyond 'restrictions on rights'. Especially when you consider that the current mess is in large part as a result of the exact sort of rhetoric that is now being legitimised. We've come full circle.

Turning a desire for closer relations with another country into a treasonable offence is extremely problematic in any country that pretends to care at all about democracy, but then again Zelensky seemingly turned away from democracy the moment he lost his poll lead last year and started having his opponents arrested. Now he's banned basically every party that isn't right wing and vehemently nationalist! YAY... i guess. There's a very convenient coalescing of the opportunity to deal with both genuine 'traitors' (is wanting to not be at war treachery?) and also permanently eradicate an entire (completely valid) political identity under the guise of 'national security'. 

&gt; I wish Russia hadn't started this war and that Ukraine had the luxury of giving those people all the due process we expect in the west. But Russia is the one that took that luxury away, and any innocent people who die as a result of Ukraine's predictable actions in response I am going to attribute to Russia as well.

they weren't giving people 'due process' before all this either. They basically continue to ignore the [mass murder](https://ukraine.un.org/en/126054-7-years-no-answers-what-lacking-investigations-events-odesa-2-may-2014) of 'pro federalist' ukrainians in 2014... Because they can presumably portray those people as 'pro russian' traitors. 

Frankly the country comes across as a corrupt cesspit, and the current political class - despite the western media narrative - are only different from the previous ones in that they are unashamedly pandering to western ideals. At the end of the day the only people who suffer are the ordinary citizens, but i really hate the way we completely ignore the very real political and social problems/ divisions in ukraine just because we think it might harm russia.

Oh that's something I deal with every day.

So: You can use cloud providers two ways.

First - and this is what you should do tbh - use them as providers of commodity virtual hardware. Like with Amazon, just use their EC2 boxes to run generic dockers without relying on any cloud-specific functionality, RDS for plain postgresql/mysql db servers, S3 as dumb file storage, if you need some service like a queue or such, just use EC2 box with docker to do this instead of their native solution like SQS. And if you need some extra functionality, use it through some kind of compatibility layer to do so if possible. There's some services that aren't possible to handle this way, especially anything network and security related tends to be highly cloud-specific, but you can stay &gt;90% generic.

This way, if you need to migrate to a custom cloud, or (horror) on-prem, it's reasonably straightforward. It also enables things like running full environment locally for qa or debugging in some stack of dockers.

Of course that's not what cloud vendors are pushing. These very helpful people really love to offer super convenient functionality where they do all the work for you, but you're basically stuck to a specific cloud without enormous amount of migration work. If you do that, just migration between cloud providers is a multiyear project. AWS currently offers 200+ services, and if your company relies on them heavily, good luck ever disentangling yourself and switching to a different cloud provider. There are definite advantage to this model, so it's popular, but you get vendor locked hard.

If you did thing the second way, then it sort of doesn't matter if you migrate Amazon to Google/Microsoft or Amazon to on-prem, once Amazon cuts you off you're totally screwed.

If you did things the first way, then setting up your private virtual cloud isn't actually too bad, it's just very different cost structure, and you might buy more hardware up-front, and hire some extra people to manage functionality that was previously cloud-provided.

Anyway, if Amazon/Google/Microsoft cut off Russia hard, that will destroy a lot of Russian IT.",573eb18f0198911fec69c00b8ac20899e6193334,True,False,,,,,0,1652284801,,0,{},i876fpf,False,t3_un86mu,False,True,t1_i86iasc,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/un86mu/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_11_2022/i876fpf/,1652284822,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652256001.0,

They no longer have the clearance or need to know, and so they cannot know what the information is that justifies these modifications to the force.


If the Marines are going to be a rapid response force they can't be beholden to logistical requirements that make them more closely resemble Army #2. The concern then becomes, how do you make them combat effective and minimize casualties with a reduced emphasis on heavy equipment, which is a valid concern. I think this was a larger concern a few years ago for those without adequate clearance to see the wargame data when the changes were announced. 

Now we don't need to see classified wargame data, the justification for deemphasizing heavier equipment and increasing platoon level firepower via drones and portable guided missiles is playing out before our eyes in the Ukraine conflict.

&gt;“RKN is embarrassingly bad at blocking Telegram, so most people keep using it without any intermediaries,” said Ilya Andreev, COO and co-founder of Vee Security, which has been providing a proxy service to bypass the ban. Currently, it is supporting up to 2 million users simultaneously, although this is a relatively small proportion considering Telegram has around 14 million users in the country (and, likely, more considering all the free publicity it’s been getting).
&gt;
&gt; As we described earlier this week, the reason so many IP addresses are getting blocked is because Telegram has been using a technique that allows it to “hop” to a new IP address when the one that it’s using is blocked from getting accessed by RKN. It’s a technique that a much smaller app, Zello, had also resorted to using for nearly a year when the RKN announced its own ban.",3217a14291922380f77f286f08c9910fff9185fa,True,False,,,,,0,1652283919,,0,{},i8745ut,False,t3_un86mu,False,True,t1_i87127b,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/un86mu/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_11_2022/i8745ut/,1652283936,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652255119.0,

The National Defense Strategy dictates the strategic policies and focus of DOD, it placed China at the top in terms of priority. The USMC reforming for a China A2AD mission set means they fully align with the NDS. So they're no longer playing second Army, now they're doing something the Army can't do, nor can the Navy.

To go further, think about next year's NDS. With Russian ground capabilities essentially destroyed in Ukraine, why exactly does the US Army need a big budget to equip and train to fight Russia? Which means the USMC can get a lot of that budget too, because the China ""threat"" still exists.

&gt; From what I saw they’d need to rely more on the navy and with cutting out the air power they’d have to try either again on the navy or air force.

They're relying more on long range missiles to engage other islands that are Chinese held (which they can then take by amphibious assault after they're mostly destroyed), they can take out Chinese ships, and they're increasing ADA capabilities to protect themselves. They aren't relying on the USAF from Japan or SK nor Navy carriers for air support, as the idea is that once things go hot they'll effectively be cut off on their Wake Islands until they can kill enough PLA Navy capabilities that a USN fleet counterattack into the SCS area is possible without heavy losses.

&gt;Plus to gain that budget they’re losing a lot of other things so are you basically robbing Peter to pay Paul? 

Within DOD, they're increasing the budget to give it to all branches but mainly the USMC, a first. Within the USMC, to gain new capabilities they are absolutely robbing Peter to pay Paul. I HATE that decision but that's what they're doing. Personally I think this decision is idiotic because it neuters them for basically every other conflict they might find themselves in that isn't Wake Island 2030 against the PLA Navy that can't even happen without starting WW3 against a major nuclear power that our economy is utterly reliant on too. 

But this isn't actually about protecting America, this is about protecting branches of service and budgets, which is basically the only thing that service chiefs actually care about. 

&gt;Also they’re losing several thousand frontline troops as well. That never seems like a good idea to me however I could have missed something on that front.

Berger doesn't need infantry as much as other things. Without Congress changing the size of the USMC, the brass needs to do internal reforms, so every infantry position removed is another opened in an existing or brand new MOS. Every tube arty battery lost is a rocket battery gained. Losing tanks not only gained the tanker slots but also all the enabler units like the maintenance and bridging companies that supported them. 

Infantry will exist to protect those other things, mainly rocket batteries firing long range precision missiles, air defenses, and drones. 

The only reform not done to rob Peter to pay Paul was reducing the air wing, which was done because the USMC has been hemorrhaging fixed and rotary wing pilots for years, it's pipeline can't keep up or replace them, so they'd rather have a smaller number of fully manned squadrons than more partially manned squadrons. Which is just the type of shit that is going to be used down the road to justify more drones for UCAV, attack, utility and transport, etc. 

I'm amused by how this war, on top of using USMC arty in Syria a few years ago, has taught how absolutely vital tube arty still is and yet they're getting rid of most to go with low capacity and super expensive rockets/missiles, that they'll never get a large stockpile of, that supply will always have major difficulties providing, etc. But arty can't hit PLAN ships over the horizon...",527ae25365332b04f4ae636e5b67e8c3a396f484,True,False,,,,,0,1652283195,,0,{},i872b27,False,t3_un860l,False,True,t1_i86s5bj,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/un860l/force_design_2030_may_2022_update_and_overview/i872b27/,1652283213,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652254395.0,

You've got it backwards - when it comes to land warfare, the Army is the generic jack of all trades, Just as the Navy is for naval warfare, and the air force is for air warfare. The marines exist, originally, because the Navy needed some soldiers on board its ships to assist in ship to ship combat and in amphibious assaults of limited scope. That mission grew to include being amphibious assault specialists of larger scope (WWII), as well as assault troops and army analogues in general (WWI) due to the fact that if you have more troops than you have beaches to storm, they are still going to get employed somewhere, even if it's inland. 

""Why do the marines still exist if their just a smaller, more poorly funded and equipped army that has the same mission"" is a question that has popped up here as the focus of potential combat zones appeared to be almost entirely land based, which the Marines have answered mainly by focusing on the ""every man a rifleman"" ethos and by leaning in to the shock/assault trooper mentality, basically focusing on being a meaner, more war-and-mission-focused version of the Army.

It's only in the last 20-30 years where for some reason the USMC being a literal second army (albeit with far denser light infantry capability) kind of settled as a reasonable solution, because traditional light infantry fit the mission sets well. 

I think the window for this is closing. Every service branch is scrambling to figure out how to achieve the NDS with constrained funds. Current USMC force structure doesn't give any credible answers to ""how will you contribute to the fight against China?"". They can occupy islands, and then... that's basically it. Maybe it can reinforce Taiwan. Beyond occupying islands (and I guess denying them to China), they have no additional contribution to the fight.

Smaller, more flexible units with multiple means of engaging/destroying the enemy and able to work in a distributed manner seems like a good way to lean into the future.  Particularly if the thinking is that the next major threat is China, Marines would need to take key islands while having to both project long range firepower against Chinese shipping/aircraft, protect against enemy missiles/airstrikes, and also do so with minimal footprint due to the small working area of each island.  That said, I think that there is a risk of overspecializing and becoming too lightweight, and this kind of change might not stack up that well against an insurgency type fight.  Sure, the Marine Corps is saying that it'll leave sustained fights to the Army, but when push comes to shove...

And while I think the Marine's have a plan, the Navy also needs to play a major role.  Can we grow the Navy while shrinking down vessel sizes or heavily automating some tasks?

In a very legal sense, yes...

Sovereignty isn't some single entity. It can be pooled, transferred or ceded. I think you're confusing sovereignty as a base concept with sovereignty as a functional means of engaging with the world. You can lose some of your sovereignty without *losing your sovereignty*. IDK maybe there's a language barrier?

&gt; So neither the EU or NATO involves loss of sovereignty then?

Not if you ignore what sovereignty means and how those institutions work no.

But if you actually understand what sovereignty means and how those institutions work then yes.

I feel dirty posting this, but i just know that you're far too smug to ever realise you're wrong.

&gt;&gt; By creating a Community of unlimited duration, having its own institutions, its own personality, its own legal capacity and capacity of representation on the international plane and, more particularly, real powers stemming from a limitation of sovereignty or a transfer of powers from the States to Community, the Member States have limited their sovereign rights and have thus created a body of law which binds both their nationals and themselves...The transfer by the States from their domestic legal system to the Community legal system of the rights and obligations arising under the Treaty carries with it a permanent limitation of their sovereign rights.

This might cause some level of cognitive dissonance in russophile twitter because, or course, they've been claiming for weeks they are in russian control due to the first claims and lolling at any maps that showed them still under UA control.

If you're wondering about significance.... about 3km south of Kurulka is a tiny hamlet called Pashkove, where the road ends.... but about 5km further south than that lies the last railroad into Solviansk/Kramatorsk/Sverodonetsk.

Russia is thought to be someone who uses brute force to accomplish their goals but the reality isn't as clear. Toying with it since the early 80s, they have something they call ""reconnaissance fires complex"" as a tactic, aka precision strike, which is just a very fancy way of saying a very sophisticated commo network that allows them to find targets either by ground recon, meeting engagements or drones and then being able to fire on them with arty very quickly and accurately. 

That's what spooked the US Army. We knew they had 3x the arty that we have, we knew they'd been talking about recon fires complex fire decades, and we had thought they pulled it off as they had bragged that they could do it, within 10 seconds, which is faster than us. 

However, no, turns out that was a lie and there is no indication that they can do it quickly and most units don't seem to be trained to do it rapidly at all and their commo system is still pretty primitive.

That said they're doing the same thing in this offensive that they did in Mariupol, which is recon fires complex simplistic, they're relying heavily on drones to find targets and advancing ground units cautiously until they make contact, finding the enemy defensive positions, then either taking cover or even retreating while they call in heavy fires. Rinse and repeat until the position is so weakened ground forces can push them out or they retreat from fires alone. It's much safer in terms of not taking heavy casualties but it's VERY slow and extremely logistically demanding in terms of resupply for arty ammo. But it works too.

Not to say they aren't taking heavy casualties, they're still regularly driving into ambushes and fire sacks, they're still very susceptible to counterattacks and arty fire missions.

This isn't whataboutism, but this could be used to describe the same tactics that have seen such great success in the UK and US. The current UK govt explicitly lie about absolutely everything, even when it's demonstrably untrue. Even when they are looking at a video disproving what they claim. I personally think that the scare stories about 'hybrid warfare', troll farms etc are heavily overblown, but they just feed into our general preconceived suspicions and biases against the likes of russia.

I go back to the weapons inspection example that i've used before: If the soviets let us inspect their weapons then they must be hiding something, but if they don't let us then they also must be hiding something. Fundamentally it's more about deeply ingrained suspicion than anything. For some countries/people we will just interpret everything through the worst/ most cynical lens regardless.

To emphasise my point regarding inherent biases - Trump's entire campaign against Huawei was entirely baseless as far as i can tell, but people lapped it up because 'well it's china and china bad'.

Ah yes. He spent 23 years carefully concocting his master plan and then... There was no real plan.

It only makes sense to blame this on base territorial conquest from the perspective if wartime propaganda. This conflict is the result of gradual escalation over a period of 12 months following on from 7 years of heightened tensions. There are also self explanatory geostrategic and geopolitical reasons behind the conflict, even if the conflict itself is immoral. You might as well say we invaded Iraq 'because oil'

&gt;  wanted to exercise their sovereignty and choose an alliance with NATO

Unfortunately sovereignty isn't some magic button that you can just push and do whatever you want. Even more so when it comes to interactions at the supranational level.

That you want to do something does not mean that you can do it, nor that others will find it acceptable. That is why treaties and diplomacy exist.

Ukraine can apply to join a treaty, but unfortunately they are not the only relevant actors. The other treaty signatories also have to make a decision regarding whether to accept accession, how, when and on what terns, and any third parties affected by said Treaty will inevitably voice their displeasure or try to put a stop to it. 

Diplomacy here is essential as it enables you to know what you can actually do with your sovereignty. They can figure out any potential consequences from various actions and advocate a course of action based on what is in the perceived interests of the state. 

Now normally the third parties will rely on diplomacy to try and prevent various decisions they don't like, then grumble if they don't get their way. Which has basically been russia's pov for the last 30 years. However in extremis they will resort to extreme measures if for instance they think it poses a direct threat to them.

Compare Cuba and the US. Both are sovereign countries yes? Now which one do you think has the ability to actually 'exercise their sovereignty' in the international sphere? Because it ain't Cuba.

Sovereignty means total power domestically (although even that's not true). It doesn't mean total power regarding geopolitical decisions. The less powerful a country is militarily/economically, the more they need to concern themselves with how their actions affect or are perceived by those around them.

With that in mind either the Ukrainian government has no idea what diplomacy is, or they ignored diplomacy entirely for domestic political reasons and are now suffering the consequences. I'd wager the US provided some vague 'guarantees' too that made zelensky feel like he was in a stronger position than he was (as happened with Georgia).

Finland made the sovereign decision to protect its interests by *not* joining Nato even when the ussr was on their border and far more of a 'threat' than modern Russia. That was a sensible policy. It didn't make them any less sovereign. Ukraine has followed a poor policy seemingly based on populism rather than pragmatism. 

&gt; That you are trying to frame this decision as a “loss of sovereignty” is serious mental gymnastics on your part.

I'm not. I'm pointing out that discussing this in simplistic terms of 'lost sovereignty' doesn't really reflect the situation. I'd argue that sovereignty in itself has little to do with it.

&gt; Entering into a voluntary agreement is not synonymous with loss of sovereignty.

A voluntary agreement where many of your laws are written in a different country and you inherently restrict your ability to make a whole plethora of decisions at the national level? Or one that could drag you into an existential war and destroy your state itself? 

I'm pro Nato membership and pro EU membership, but both come with huge losses of practical sovereignty.

De jure sovereignty is retained as you can technically leave the treaties, but de facto it really isn't.",67f2a1ae3ce82f7c8df846b531a98a5a87a573df,True,False,,,,,0,1652274587,,0,{},i86hjj3,False,t3_umwmzj,False,True,t1_i869xp1,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/umwmzj/did_russias_general_staff_miss_warnings_of_a_hard/i86hjj3/,1652274599,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652245787.0,

Given Belarus's recent decision to post soldiers to the border, I could certainly see scenario where either A) Poland threatens Belarus that if it intervenes, Poland will come to the aid of Ukraine either by directly intervening in Northern Ukraine (most likely), or attacking Western Belarus (extremely unlikely), or B) Belarus attacks Northern Ukraine as a feint and Poland responds as listed above to reduce the need for Ukrainian redeployment in the East. 

Again, I am not saying this is at all likely to happen. There is maybe a 5-10% chance that Belarus attacks at best given that Lukashenko, despite his best attempts to present himself as such, is not as stupid as he would have us believe.  I think such a decision would largely be contingent on whether he believes he has been able to rally enough support or purge enough dissent within the military over recent months. If he were to attack, I would probably place a bit of a higher probability (maybe 25%?) on a Polish response because they have been chomping at the bit to get involved in this conflict, and they would likely wipe the floor with Belarussian forces. I think the threat of Polish intervention alone would be enough to scare Lukashenko away and ease Ukrainian concerns about an attack from the North and allow them to focus on the Donbas offensive.

The best insight I have seen for this issue is something that I read somewhere and now cannot find to quote directly. Essentially,the retired generals who are critical of the changes being made have not seen the data from the wargames that justifies the changes. They no longer have the clearance or need to know, and so they cannot know what the information is that justifies these modifications to the force. Nor can this information be used in the open to make a case for the reforms. This is perhaps why I was unable to find quality analysis on the Force Design 2030 when I went looking. 

Another factor involved that makes the program controversial is that it stems from hard choices being made in terms of budget and missions. The Commandant of the USMC has made the choice to turn the organization into a force more specialized to countering China in the islands in the Pacific. This has come at the loss of the capability to fight on land, in major wars, or in Europe for example. Much of the sharpest attacks against the program are about this loss of capability.

- Shoigu and Gerasimov are still in their posts and assuming ever greater responsibilities, which is not what you’d expect of embarrassed generals. Meanwhile, there are reports it was the FSB that was purged, indicating this operation was planned by non-military actors. 

- Operation Z also followed the blueprint of Danube-1968, a rather amateurish choice given decades of military change, and not something you’d expect out of the Russian General Staff whose mission statement is literally to analyze changes in war and plan accordingly.

In spite of that I’d hesitate to call the military brass blameless. The critical problems of the army are underfunding and corruption, and while they don’t control the former they absolutely oversee the latter.

I actually believe we are on a verge of a more peaceful world, rather than almost at world war 3.  
  
Because china now sees, that even if it invests a trillion dollars into the most modern and massive navy, Taiwan will invest a few billion dollars into the largest drone fleet of hundreds of thousands of drones, both high tech, and modified consumer versions, and just wreck everything that even starts to approach their island. Even with advance air-defense, it's not that hard for me to imagine a complete over-saturation of defense systems and interception missiles (as rockets, artilery and fighter jets would also be involved, not just a monolitic drone attack), and with every lost ship, the air-defenses become less capable, hence, more ships lost, hence, more damage to anti-air capabilities.  
  
Obviously this is an oversimplification. Lets say china does manage to land some troops. They know their army structure is untested, their logistical support capabilities and issues are unknown, the efficiency of their command structure is unknown, probably even more bureaucratic and ineffective than that, of the ruskies. As russia failed to realise, entering enemy territory is just part 1 of the invasion. With no air support, in unfamiliar territory and terrain, chances of any success don't look too good.  
  
Also, russia, as it currently exists, as a zombie of the ussr, will cease to exist after this war, I believe. Which will lead to a more stable eastern europe, and western/central asia. This level of human suffering, economic damage and political / cultural humiliation, is not sustainable, even amongst the most brainwashed of populations. Look at the reactions of nazi prisoners, being shown pictures of the concentration camps. All of them are shocked, or can't even look at the screen.

https://medium.com/@x_TomCooper_x/ukraine-war-10-may-2022-e7598e3d0f57

It's in English, but basically the author relays that he feels the evidence relayed to him doesn't support that the Belohorivka landing failed, nor that all the pontoons were destroyed.

The author is unfamiliar to me, but looking through it he doesn't seem to have any biases (except a general pro-UA pro-Western one), and his analysis (while pessimistic) is rooted in his good faith best assessment of known evidence and tactics.

Just as an background for those unfamiliar:

Russians have been trying to pontoon across the stretch of river around Bilohorivka (small town west of Severodonetsk) for several days now.  The first attempt was publically, but a day after that (May 9th ish), Ukrainian sources suggested that a sizeable force of Russians pontooned across on a different bridge.

A few hours later, those same sources claimed the bridge destroyed and the forces were cut off and being mopped up.

https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/umh1p3/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_10_2022/i835et2/

The next day, we got more sources claiming such.  (indeed, another destroyed bridge was found and geolocated at this point, but I'm yet to see any evidence that Bilohorivka is secure again)

Was it in Ukraine's interest to refuse a status of neutrality, even if it limited their sovereignty? I would suggest that the answer is self evidently no. The answer is only yes if you believe the imo laughably revisionist idea that putin has always wanted to conquer the whole of ukraine and that a russian invasion was inevitable.... he just forgot about it for 23 years.

Does ukraine plan on being attacked or attacking anyone? I assume not, therefore the simple stance of neutrality makes no difference either way. The problem wasn't the 'loss of sovereignty' per se, but the domestic political situation in ukraine where NATO membership is desired presumably as a means of 'cutting off' ukraine from russia in a way that essentially forces ukraine into a set divergent trajectory from russia. It strikes me that ukraine's been part of a long term 'political civil war' where rather than dealing with the political east/west division, respecting the 'borderland', ethnically/linguistically diverse nature of the country and seeking consensus, people are desperately trying to ostracise those whom they politically disagree with. That sort of division isn't healthy when it comes to such serious geostrategic decisions.

I've spent the last 8 years talking to brexit supporters who proclaim the need for 'total' british sovereignty.... but simultaneously ardently advocate NATO membership (arguably a far greater loss of sovereignty than EU membership) and demand we sign trade deals across the world.... with each one being a loss of sovereignty.

&gt;is not interfered with by the sovereign.

將能而君不御者勝

&gt;commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed.

君命有所不受

Personally though and in the general commentary on treatise, the idea that you have commands of the sovereign that shouldn't be obeyed is more about allowance for field commanders to countermand orders from above that are not appropriate because of the fast moving nature of warfare. This is essentially mission command in field commander discretion despite the existence of strict hierarchies in a Confucius worldview. Disobeying your sovereign is normally a capital offense and your head gets chopped off.

However, the bigger question is what are the commands that shouldn't be obeyed, that is a much harder question, and the treatise is more silent on the appropriateness of a field commander making a decision to not obey a sovereign's order to go to war. If anything, the level of latitude could allow for the opposite, a field commander's decision and initiative to go to war despite a sovereign's order to not resist. One of the most famous examples is the so called armed remonstrance in 1936 in Xi'an Incident where a subordinate essentially kidnapped Chiang Kai-shek to force him to officially go to war with an expansionist Japan that is already involved in an undeclared war in the Northeast and stop the Chinese civil war to form an united front.

However, I am finding that type of thinking is probably very rare in both United States and Russia since this is essentially mutiny, and incompatible with the American idea of civilian control of the military as well as Russian's military follow your order to the letter culture. The result is probably court martial or getting MacArthur-ed. But this type of thinking is semi officially endorsed by China with field commanders countermanding order from even the Central Military Commission and the President viewed favorably if done in the right set of circumstances though it is not unheard of to be punished if done in the wrong set of circumstances.

All in all, I would think I wouldn't place either the Bush administration's nor President Putin's decision to go to war in the category of commands that shouldn't be obeyed even if they were bad decisions since the remedy is probably worse.",7ed731e9f4311d665df450aa2de3d38496b1fa7d,True,False,,,,,0,1652269320,,0,{},i867bhu,False,t3_umwmzj,False,True,t1_i85f8mk,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/umwmzj/did_russias_general_staff_miss_warnings_of_a_hard/i867bhu/,1652269335,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652240520.0,

Zelensky published some estimates ([2.5k-3k KIA, 10k WIA](https://thehill.com/policy/international/3271024-zelensky-says-up-to-3000-ukrainian-soldiers-killed-during-war-with-russia/) a few weeks ago), but they look really low to most people. If we extrapolate them to today proportionally, Zelensky's numbers would translate to 4k KIA, 15k WIA or so.

Basically the numbers which are credible, at least sufficiently credible for some estimates:

* Ukrainians estimate Russians to have 26350 KIA - this is good starting point, as in the end we only care about proportion anyway 
* typically in wars there's about 3:1 WIA:KIA ratio, which would imply about 105k total Russian casualties
* Oryx shows 3.5:1 Russian to Ukrainian equipment losses

If we assume personnel losses are comparable to equipment losses, and WIA:KIA structure is the same, that would imply 30k overall Ukrainian casualties, of which 7.5k KIA, a lot higher than Zelensky's numbers.

But let's say Russian medivac is absolutely trash, and their turrets just instakill their crews etc., and Ukrainian is actually quite good, so Russians actually have 2:1 KIA to WIA, and Ukrainians 4:1 - both would definitely agree with all the reports.

Then we'd have total Russian casualties 79k, then Ukrainian by Oryx ratio 22k total, of which 5.5k KIA, 16.5k WIA. This is modestly higher than Zelensky's numbers, but it depends a lot on the low Russian WIA:KIA assumption.

How believable is this guesstimate? 🤷

*In letters, U.S. tries to reshape Taiwan’s weapons requests* State Department says Taipei should buy missiles and upgraded artillery, not helicopters.

https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/10/u-s-taiwan-weapons-request-00031507

&gt; * The Biden administration is rebuffing some of Taiwan’s requests for big-ticket weapons, instead urging Taipei to buy other equipment the U.S. believes will better deter and defend against China, according to U.S. and Taiwanese officials and documents obtained by POLITICO.

&gt; * The moves are part of a push by the Biden administration as the threat of a Chinese invasion appears to become more urgent, officials say.

&gt; * But the Biden administration is trying to convince Taipei that these expensive items, while fine for peacetime operations, would not survive an all-out assault from the mainland.

&gt; * Instead, the administration is urging Taipei to learn from Ukraine and invest in smaller, mobile systems such as drone swarms, Stinger anti-tank missiles and Javelin anti-aircraft missiles, which are less vulnerable to China’s advanced weapons, officials said.

&gt; * “Continuing to pursue systems that will not meaningfully contribute to an effective defense strategy is inconsistent with the evolving security threat that Taiwan faces.”

&gt; * Taiwan is watching the war in Ukraine closely. Many civilians in Taiwan are expressing a greater desire to learn how they can play a role in defending their island and resisting Chinese forces if necessary, Glaser said, but it’s not yet clear how far the Taiwanese military will go to help prepare the civilian population.",88e70adac9439913c71998d7d18f8a54355751a9,True,False,,,,,0,1652242069,,0,{},i856fmn,True,t3_ulrwle,False,True,t3_ulrwle,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ulrwle/general_questions_comments_pet_theories_and/i856fmn/,1652242087,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652213269.0,

*Canadianization.* The authors note that the need to Canadianize is a downside of OTS purchases and shows the CH-147F as an example. This is the opposite of what OTS means. Not Canadianizing the fucking things and keeping our requirements in line with NATO requirements is a tenet of OTS purchasing (Globemasters, for example). Making a unique variant and being unable to do training or get parts (F model CH-147, which we’re the sole operator of) is not off-the-shelf purchasing.

*Red tape.* The authors note that complying with the requirements of our “most complex” procurement system is a downside to OTS purchasing. This should not be a downside, this should be a goddamn wake-up call. Make it so we can buy the shit we need, don’t fit the solution to the system. Give us the right tools so we can get the things we need, not the things we’re most able to get with our Byzantine process.

*Not everything is fighter jets.* Sure, we might need customized solutions for warships and jet fighters. But what about supply trucks? Runway snow removal? Pistols? All of those are absolutely overrun with bureaucracy. You cannot hold that we have unique requirements for a fuel truck, just buy something that works. But everything is fighter jets. We apply the same procurement standard to everything. One size fits all. This means, ludicrously, fighter jets are nominally held to the same standard as office chairs (the reality is, of course, quite different, but the system is *even more broken* on paper).",632937eea6b99b46dc93b9df18177385d8395711,True,False,,,,,0,1652234194,,0,{},i84q9p6,False,t3_umla6g,False,True,t3_umla6g,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/umla6g/if_only_warships_grew_on_trees_the_complexities/i84q9p6/,1652234209,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652205394.0,

The article rightly points out the cost of Canadianization requirements. I think they side step the the implied thrust of some pro-COTS pundits, which is that CF/DND should suck it up in some cases and just not add Canada specific requirements (or control them better). Like apparently there are plans for potential F35 modifications. I can only hope they don't make that an even bigger dumpster fire. 

CF basically has two sets of missions. Domestic, which is mostly just humanitarian, and border patrol (arctic sovereignty), and NATO missions. 

It's painful because the most kinetic missions are likely to be those NATO missions, where those Canada only requirements are far less critical. I'm sure someone in DND is cursing and just wishing it could deploy two forces.

No, they can not be assumed to be. Ukraine has painted Z's on vehicles, has used footage from pre 2022. Towing a captured vehicle 100m would get it recorded as a new captured or abandoned vehicle if someone takes a photo a week later. They only way to have any faith in counting is for each chassis to have a unique identifier, and that identifier present in every image. If that's not happening orxy counts are no better than UA or RF government statement. Which of course no one has faith in.

&gt;around 3000 

The only counts I've seen just had a look at current google Earth images, and then had a stab at how many looked like they maybe didn't have turrets or open hatches or something. 

Issue with this is that Russia has a whole lot  more vehicles in storage than what they count as 'reserve' (which is probably better termed active reserve). Up until 2013 they listed t-62/64 as in reserve, and then afterwards as 'scrapped'. These are then winding up in Syria, DNR/LNR etc. 

Point is the identified 'unsalvagable' vehicles are likely t64/62, bmp1, whatever else, that isn't counted as reserve the first place. So disingenuous to just wipe half their numbers from record without a proper assesment.

&gt; * The risk of confusing myth with actual analysis of events as war unfolds motivates historians and military analysts to be cautious and meticulous in their approach to sifting the claims and counterclaims generated by competing war narratives.

&gt; * …an imperceptible myth has developed surrounding the political-military underestimation of the level of resistance to the invasion by the Ukrainian Armed Forces, appearing in various forms in an effort to ‘explain’ the poor performance of the Russian military.

&gt; *  While this has gained traction and credibility in many quarters, it is a bold assertion to say that Russia’s General Staff was unaware or simply missed the possibility that the campaign in Ukraine might prove to be long and hard. Did the General Staff ignore or miss pre-war warnings that the conflict would be far from easy? Does any evidence exist to the contrary?

&gt; * However, in the pre-war phase, evidence of warnings directed at those in such positions emerged within the Russian military media. On 3 February, an article appeared questioning the whole idea of an easy victory: Prognozy krovozhadnykh politologov (Predictions of bloodthirsty political scientists). Its author, Colonel (Retd) Mikhail Khodarenok, the military correspondent with Gazeta.ru, provided considerable credibility to its argument. 

&gt; * His article warning of the risks of the coming war in Ukraine was published in the particularly reputable Nezavisimoye Voyennoye Obozreniye (Independent Military Review) – which is widely read by senior General Staff officers – rather than Khodarenok’s more usual platform on Gazeta.ru.

&gt; * Khodarenok’s article slammed ‘enthusiastic hawks and hasty cuckoos’ for claiming that war in Ukraine could be an easy rollover victory, similar to the successful seizure of Crimea in 2014. 

&gt; * Putin’s flawed decision-making likely resulted not only from badly crafted intelligence – especially from the FSB – but also from his largely successful previous experience of using military force. 

&gt; * …any suggestion that the General Staff had not considered the potential risks of embarking upon a large-scale war against Ukraine is not supported by the existence of the warnings from Khodarenok and Ivashov. While neither were in any sense insiders involved in the decision-making and operational planning, such warnings were most likely known to the General Staff. 

&gt; * The reasons for the ensuing debacle in the execution of Russian war planning – especially in the opening weeks of the war – are most likely multidimensional rather than monocausal. 

&gt; * In any case, in the context of the ongoing ‘special military operation’ and the draconian laws inhibiting open discussion in the public domain concerning pertinent operational details, Russian sources will remain decidedly quiet on such issues, allowing plenty of scope for speculation and war myths to take root.
