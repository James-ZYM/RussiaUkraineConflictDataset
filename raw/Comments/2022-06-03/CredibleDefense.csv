Pretty sure he claimed that you shouldn't label it the forever war because it's gone on for **100 days**.

That's what I take from ""A bit too early to call a 3 months war ""forever war"""".

Frankly, I agree with him.

And I disagree with them too.

&gt;Yeah, in 3 months we gave up that. What's it going to be next month? What about August? What about December? What about in 2025 when the Ukrainians are finally almost about to retake Kherson?

Well that's the thing - there's not going to be 2025.  As I said, Ukrainian war weariness is going to be a problem a lot faster than western will.  That came with an implication that I don't think the war will go on until 2025.

Honestly, I'm pretty sure the war will either end or freeze before **2023**.  If it doesn't, then you can start calling it a ""forever war"" (still kinda unfair since the forever wars lasted a decade, but whatever)

Such is life, nothing is certain. If we only backed a sure thing we'd never get anywhere.

You seem to be under a misapprehension as to how much this invasion has genuinely pissed off Europe as a whole. We are very clear that if Putler wins this, we're next. No illusions that it will stop here.

While ever someone is fighting they'll keep paying in there is literally no downside for the US here - they're selling arms AND making Russia weaker.

Because there is a very strong possibility that even with continued western military support for years to come that Ukraine might not even be able to achieve it. And if so, why would everyone in the West support that as an end-state goal? There is optimism and there is foolishness, and they aren't always that close to one another and that would be one of those cases. 

Also, people in western countries might even consider that they don't even give a shit if its possible or not, they don't want to go that long for years. Because this support isn't without cost. For instance, just because those outside of Ukraine aren't dying doesn't mean they aren't being negatively affected. And many might not want to be negatively affected. Especially with an already very problematic global economy and supply chain that was still in the early stages of recovering from COVID before this war started. This isn't WW2, yanking countries like the US out of the Great Depression, this is actually likely to trigger one. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Russia has invaded a sovereign country, it seems reasonable that that country should want the invader repulsed (particularly given their repulsive behaviours, pun intended).

Fine, then Ukraine can do it with whoever wants to support them or alone. And those who don't want to continue supporting them to that vague, undefined, painful, and potentially impossible conclusion can bail out. 

But let's be real. If that happens, especially if its the US (who is leading the proxy war) who starts wavering, then Ukraine will fold like laundry, they are entirely dependent on us to not only contribute what we are, but to pressure others to do so as well.

Just some example: 

Zelenky opens the flood gates with a negative statement and finally talks up high casualties and that's big news. Then earlier in the week Biden backtracks from months of tough talking and starts seeming very reasonable. Last week the news was filled about reports about food crisis, and they aren't bullshit stories concocted by media trying to manipulate people. Neither are gas prices, inflation, etc.  We still don't need editorial or segment condemning the long term future of Ukraine for many to feel that way. That's just the mood.   

And that starts affecting the media themselves, who are following the same news everyone else is. Suddenly editors and producers who a month earlier might never allowed negative news to be spun up about the future of the Ukraine war are allowing editorials and segments. After all, everyone else is doing it too! 

I think people don't want to read or watch positive news that comes across as propaganda. They want to read or hear about realpolitik opinions and alternatives. If they don't offer than bait, they don't get bites. And then they don't get paid.  

This isn't new. In July 1944, the British and American press were turning on the generals running the Normandy campaign because they hadn't broken out yet. They weren't doing it because they actually wanted Ike and Monty relieved to manipulate the war effort, they were impatient and felt it was their duty to act.

And regards to Biden. First, he's not dictator, he can't do whatever he wants. Second, he's been flipflopping on Ukraine since the beginning:

[Biden: ""*And it depends on what it does. It's one thing if it's a minor incursion and then we end up having a fight about what to do and not do*""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiMDmtcQEEM)

['There are no minor incursions': Ukrainian president rebukes Biden over remarks on Russian invasion](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/01/20/ukrainian-president-rebukes-biden-over-russia-minor-incursion-remark/6590573001/)

Earlier in the war, Biden outright called for Putin's ouster by stating [""*For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power.*""](https://www.npr.org/2022/03/26/1089014039/biden-says-of-putin-for-gods-sake-this-man-cannot-remain-in-power) 

And then earlier this week Biden said [""*As much as I disagree with Mr. Putin, and find his actions an outrage, the United States will not try to bring about his ouster in Moscow.*""](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/opinion/biden-ukraine-strategy.html)

How about when Biden said the US would [""*respond in kind*""](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/24/biden-says-us-would-respond-to-russia-if-putin-uses-chemical-or-biological-weapons.html) to a Russian chemical weapons attack?

How about when Lloyd Austin, SECDEF, said [*""We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can't do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine.""*](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-defense-secretary-says-goal-see-russia-weakened-2022-4)  Mind you, Austin is a cabinet member and when he says something like that it is US policy, he's not speaking off the cuff. And now what is US policy? [*""We do not want to prolong the war just to inflict pain on Russia.""*](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/opinion/biden-ukraine-strategy.html)

And you didn't answer my question. So I'll elaborate it again: do you think it a conspiracy that not everyone in the world fully supports the idea an indefinite bloody war in Ukraine with the accompanying global ramifications? 

Here is a thought. Besides the obvious that not everyone was or is diehard member of the Slava Ukraini mob, or that its not the case of a Russian media IO psyop plan meant to fuck with Redditors, maybe its just because media follows moods. 

Since before this war even started and afterwards we've watched the mood and morale of Western media swing back and forth. It started out ridiculously pessimistic beforehand, to growingly less pessimistic in the first couple weeks, to irresponsibly optimistic after the Kyiv retreat to about 3 weeks ago, sliding back to pessimistic as the reality that this war isn't going to be quite nor cheap, and currently sitting  bit on the pessimistic side for some, while still glowingly optimistic for others, since obviously not all opinion pieces are suggesting maybe total victory isn't possible.  

Nah, fuck all that. Russia launched another victorious IO campaign, that can be the only explanation. And as such, since this is clearly the work of Putin, he and his agents of Russian fascism must be stopped, which means calling out and silencing all those who speak against the possibility of total Ukraine victory.",c187f5d5a4e3a050bb5b24b87c8d489c2280f4a0,True,False,,,,,0,1654290676,,0,{},ib2y2o0,False,t3_v3xszf,False,True,t1_ib2v0tn,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v3xszf/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_03_2022/ib2y2o0/,1654290694,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654261876.0,

The biggest problem with sanctions is that the vast majority of commentators don't have the first clue what they actually do. Consider them equivalent to a very low level of military conflict. It's a small amount of pressure the can be applied to damage a country, which also has costs for the country applying them.

If you threaten a country to say ""we're going to do X to you if you do Y"", and then they go and do Y anyway and you do X, *there should be no expectation that they will stop doing Y. Your sanctions are already baked into their calculations because you threatened them in advance. It is not that the sanctions have no effect; it is that the effects of the sanctions are necessarily considered acceptable by the country willing to trigger them. 

For sanctions - like all other kind of deterrence - the times when they have the most effect is the times when they didn't end up needing to be applied at all, because deterrence succeeded. The current sanctions makes things harder for Russia, and that's good, but arguably their greater value is deterring future acts of aggression by Russia and also every other country on the planet. If Russia invaded and the threatened sanctions *weren't* applied, the threats from the Western bloc would be shown to be toothless, and there would be a much smaller anticipated costs to invading a weaker neighbour.

When Crimea was invaded the Obama administration literally told them not to fight and was so worried and European leaders so languid and had so many interests that the administration said ""Don't provoke the russians, we'll get them to back off and respond with sanctions"" (I.e do nothing and also we'll do nothing)  


Fast forward to present day and because the West gave Putin the biggest victory ever, snatching some prime territory without a single soldier of his killed and a huge propaganda victory.  


Western commentators again said ""It's hopeless Kyiv will fall in two days"" and we did nothing, then far too little too late. At first supplying them for an ""insurgency"" and to make ourselves look good and then later givign single digit units over weeks. When if we gave everything we have now... 2 months ago, it would be making a difference now and likely caused a huge difference to the war.  


Telling Ukraine to give up territory the size of the czech republic and slovakia is incredibly stupid. Not just because we already did that by not addressing the Gas dependencies, pushing ahead with nordstream 2 and totally ceding to Putins desires for ""minsk"" which was pre planned from the start.  


The simple biggest reason is this would be the downfall of Ukraine..  


Why? Because its a huge victory for Putin and with the seizing of more territory and formalising it as under Russian control Putin **will not stop destabilising Ukraine.**  


He will **hone in on Zelensky** and ensure to play up the territorial loss as a great embarrassment and try to destroy the political stability in Ukraine.  Zelensky would not last after making such concessions and Putin would continue to pour billions into covert actions an destabilising Ukraine and running disinformation campaigns.  


But this time he will have a perfect lesson in how to do the next invasion correctly.  


The whole issue with him having more territory is it's more ground for manipulation. It's pretty easy to start breaking the ceasefire at will when you are shelling not from Russian territory but from ""separastist pro-russian regions"", who seriously thinks he, even if he doesn't create a Kherson Peoples republic e.t.c, he is **still going to create the necessary deniable structures**. We will see the creation of ""people's militias"" or whatever you want to call them, staffed with camouflaged Russian troops and security operatives.  


Even if he has to spend BILLIONS paying for soldiers to go there, he will do so.   


Then when the time is right he will do the same thing as with Georgia under Sakishvilli, or the lead up to this conflcit. He will instruct the security services to break the ceasefire gradually by starting increased shelling while running full disinformation that ""Kyiv warmongerers are are breaking the ceasefire"". Then what next, maybe same stupid attempts at false flags e.t.c but it will be the same process, he'll then formalise a procedural step. Either recognising ""kherson as independent"" or staging a fake referendum that they've joined Russia.  


Then he will invade again but this time learn from all the mistakes of the previous time.  


That's why I seriously disagree with  all these ideas of just trying to force Ukraine into a surrender and giving up land, people seriously have no idea what they are proposing. It would just embolden Putin. We should have given everything we have given 2 months ago if not, what we're giving now should have been accelerated and 10x the number.  


The same analysts that were saying ""this is madness, fighting until the last Ukrainian. They stand no chance. The west should negotiate for Ukraine to be neutral"" (duh they were neutral before being invaded)  


Were last week saying ""this is folly (Meersheimer) don't embarrass Russia by letting the Ukrainians win too much, make them concede or Russia will nuke!!""

&gt;One theory alleges that the United States has been funding biological weapons laboratories in Ukraine. While there are biological laboratories in Ukraine that have been backed by the United States, these institutions are aimed at preventing the production of biological weapons, according to the U.S. and Ukraine governments. Some in the U.S. media have misleadingly cited statements from American officials as evidence that the labs are producing biological weapons. Our survey finds that roughly one-quarter of Americans think this theory is probably or definitely true, including 32% of Republicans and 20% of Democrats.
&gt;
&gt;Two other theories promoted by the Russian government — that Ukraine is staging attacks and blaming them on Russia and that many top Ukrainian officials are Nazis or Nazi-sympathizers – are somewhat less credible to Americans.

&gt; * These weapons have proven essential to Ukraine’s fight for its freedom. In the wrong hands, however, they pose serious risks: MANPADS, for example, could just as easily be used against a civilian airliner, a nightmare scenario for many counterterrorism experts. 

&gt; * Given the myriad armed actors in Ukraine, keeping these weapons out of the wrong hands will prove a daunting challenge—one that the international community should start thinking about now.

&gt; * Specifically, donor nations should maintain as much control and tracking of their weapons as possible in order to ensure their recovery once the conflict concludes. 

&gt; * Throughout the 1990s, as al-Qaeda sought, unsuccessfully, to bring down commercial airliners, none of these advanced MANPADS made it into bin Laden’s hands, both because of the unwillingness of the Mujahideen to part with their few Stingers and the work of the CIA. The proactive initiative undertaken by the CIA to recover the Stinger MANPADS even before the end of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan represents exactly the sort of forward-thinking disarmament efforts that will be required in Ukraine to prevent these weapons from being misused.

So yea, if they don't collapse within a month or two, then the sanctions failed and very likely backfired in giving the worst possible outcome.

No, sanction are just always an ongoing process.  You block a part that Russia needs to build tanks, they find a second source.  You block the second source, they redesign to need a different part.  You block that part, Russia tries to make the part domestically, so you block the equipment used the make that part.  When Russia gets ahold of such machines, you try to block the specific raw materials the manufacturing machine consumes.  Etc.  Nobody involved in sanctions is surprised when people try to work around them.  But at the end of a period of time, Russia has built fewer tanks with worse components at greater expense.

It would be like a baseball player surprised that the other team's pitcher is ready to throw a second pitch because somebody threw the ball back to him after the first batter tried to hit the ball really far into the outfield.  That's just how the game is played.  You use the sanctions to make it as inconvenient and impractical to run certain lines of business because you have to dedicate more and more of your costs to just navigating the sanctions.

&gt; Another problem with sanctions is that once you hit the negotiation table is offering removal of the sanctions as the reward for complying with US demands, usually just have them forego dealing with the USA period and just work with what they have on hand. (US as a standard dont accept ""pre-conditions"")

[],False,,throwdemawaaay,,,[],,,,text,t2_xzr44,False,False,"&gt; It does appear that they are in part seeking power through a strategy of acting like a reasonable, and even charitable, organization that effectively maintains order and security.

Some of the cartels rule through terror (Zetas) while some cast themselves as a populist political movement. In Mexico the Knights Templar are particularly known for this, doing stuff like building schools and hosting village carnivals. One time when i was traveling in Oaxaca, I met a Danish couple that were biking the entire pacific coast of Mexico. They told me when they got in the area of Michoacan, a black SUV pulled over to stop them, and some scary looking guys asked some questions. They made a cell phone call, then handed the bikers a couple hundred bucks of cash and said something to the effect of ""no one will bother you in your territory"" and left. 

That's not to say these aren't ruthless people... just that they're conscious of the need to control their image.

&gt;In my recent Brookings report and Mexico Today series, I detailed how the Sinaloa Cartel has ruthlessly taken over all aspects of fisheries in Mexico — from catch to processing and sales to restaurants, not tolerating resistance.

When I was in Puerto Escondido one time, one morning there was the Army crawling all over the principal beach. Later that evening I got the whole story from a beachfront business owner. Three tuna boats came in and moored pretty late in the evening. The sailors went to a beach front palapa bar just as the elderly owner was closing up. They didn't like that so they beat the owner to death, and spent the night drinking in his bar anyhow. The owner I talked to said the army was there in the morning mostly to chase off reporters from talking to anyone. So yeah, whoever controlled those boats obviously wielded a lot of true power.

As an aside, the big tuna boats in particular are very useful for a smuggling organization, as they operate helicopters to scout for fish. They also get up to all sorts of shenanigans about trying to control the best spots, or find competing companies nets and raid them, etc. Even outside of Mexico expect for some shady stuff to be around these sorts of boats, potentially.

&gt;CJNG often merely taxes all local actors, without, at least initially, seeking full control across the entire vertical chain. But, unlike, the Sinaloa Cartel’s rule, its takeover and domination are based on brazen violence. Its modus operandi is to be more ostentatiously violent than anyone else around.

One of the things Next Generation specializes in is recruiting assassins against their will. They are very scary people indeed. Stuff straight out of a Hannibal Lector movie. Just imagine the kind of people who are so confident in their torture techniques they give their victims guns and trust them to follow orders vs shooting back.

&gt;The Sinaloa Cartel has systematically sought to build political capital with various actors: businesses, social influencers such as priests, **politicians**, armed forces, government officials and institutions, and local populations.

\[emphasis mine\] It's an open secret that Sinaloa and PRI have an alliance. PRI isn't as totally dominant in politics as they were a couple decades ago, but they still have de facto political control over most of the country, basically everything that isn't Federal or DF specific.

&gt;In short, in addition to moderating violence and extortion, the Sinaloa Cartel also provides other forms of regulations, and is effective in enforcing the rules it chooses to promote or adopt.

I'm really glad the author called out this specifically, and gave such good examples. In a place where incompetence and corruption are the norm, organized crime can become a shadow government that people rely on for practical solutions and to suppress petty crime.",818a3be726ddbf19ebccc3c6c7588817f237e1bc,True,False,,,,,0,1654283284,,0,{},ib2iv9m,False,t3_v442ht,False,True,t1_ib23t2s,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v442ht/how_the_sinaloa_cartel_rules_this_article_focuses/ib2iv9m/,1654283298,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654254484.0,

3. My point is that picking up Russia ties up EU resources. The moment Russia invade, EU has to pick a side, and it did. It's totally understandable, and it's probably strategically correct in countering Russian advances. But that has geopolitical consequences. China isn't going to see whether EU picks a side in a Sino-US conflict then decide whether to pick up Russia. China is going to pick up Russia to hedge.

4. China doesn't get to chose, not in the meaningful use of it's term. I'm sure China will be the one to fire the firsr shot, but that would be in response to something, ie without a change in status quo it is unlikely China fire the first shot. And now you just don't make sense. EU forces aren't gonna join a losing side.

None of them individually are close to matching China, South Korea, or Japan, but together, they would be able to help the US replenish losses.

&amp;#x200B;

Why would it be hard to hit the Chinese coast? China’s A2AD capabilities are mainly focused on hitting ships. China doesn’t even seem to have a lot of long-ranged, modern SAMs. The PLAGF has 600 SAMs, but those are short to mid ranged weapons. The PLAAF has likely under 300 modern, long-ranged SAMs (defined as S300, S400, and HQ-9 variants). Those SAMs will have to be spread out to cover a very large area, and probably won’t be able to stop saturation attacks of Tomahawks fired from submarines 1,500+ km away, or ballistic missiles fired from Japan, or stand-off munitions fired from stealth bombers flying from the continental US.

&amp;#x200B;

I don‘t really understand what you mean. My point is that I think China has the advantage if it is just US + Japan vs China, but US + Europe + Japan vs China + Russia is more advantageous for the US. I have no confidence that Europe will help if Russia sits out.

&amp;#x200B;

The USN is unlikely to remain the most powerful for long. Chinese naval construction is extremely rapid, and that is with military spending under 2% of GDP. China will likely surpass the US in tonnage soon. Besides, the US keeps a lot of ships scattered across the world, while China keeps all of its ships in one place. Also, the US has a lot of ships in maintenance at all times, while China can choose when the war starts and can thus make sure that the bulk of its fleet is ready when the war comes. Also, the US Navy has severe problems with sleep deprivation. Additionally, most Chinese ships are very new and likely have better sensors and stuff than most American ships, which are decades old. I’m not sure that the US Navy is even superior today. And the JMSDF might take enormous losses on day 1 of any war with China from ballistic missile attacks on ships in port.

&amp;#x200B;

Like, you mention 10-11 carriers, but that is more like 2 carriers in an actual war. Some will be in maintenance, some will be in training, and some will be in Europe or the Middle East or wherever.

Lots of EU countries like the UK have smaller shipbuilding industries as well. In any case, more shipbuilding is good.

Europe will likely bring more to the US side than Russia would bring to the Chinese side.

These non-state actors can become very powerful and a threat to state security, it will take decades of work to eliminate them and will probably require bloodshed to do so.

I thought that this article was relevant to security issues as it is dealing with the security and power of a large state, in this case Mexico. 

————————

&gt; * Large segments of Mexico’s people, territory, and economy are falling under the rule of Mexican criminal groups even in areas where violence has not flared up or has declined.

&gt; * However, the way the two largest cartels — the Sinaloa Cartel and Cartel Jalisco Nueva -Generación (CJNG) — as well as smaller criminal groups take over and rule local people, economies, and territories is not uniform. The Sinaloa Cartel deploys strategies distinct from CJNG. 

&gt; * Since the U.S. imprisonment of its most capable and notorious capo — Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera — the Sinaloa Cartel has been composed of four key factions… They each have somewhat different style of rule…

&gt; * Nonetheless, there is enough consistency in behavior and rule among the various factions within the two cartels to permit the drawing of general group characteristics.

&gt; * the Sinaloa Cartel’s self-presentation is one of buttoned-down criminals whose oppressive rule comes with predictability and some level of moderation. Indeed, a key hallmark of the Sinaloa Cartel has been a rather careful calibration of violence that imposes its domination in a form to which local politicians, businesses, and people can develop predictable coping mechanisms. 

&gt; *  …the Sinaloa Cartel continues to systematically seek to take over the entire vertical chain of many economies in Mexico and not just illegal ones.

&gt; * …it also purposefully set out to build up vertical control first over fentanyl imports from China, and since 2019 over precursor and pre-precursor imports from China and their processing into fentanyl

&gt; * …in addition to moderating violence and extortion, the Sinaloa Cartel also provides other forms of regulations, and is effective in enforcing the rules it chooses to promote or adopt.

&gt; * During the spring of 2020 as Covid-19 was sweeping the world and Mexico, Mexican and international media became mesmerized by how various Mexican criminal groups, including the Sinaloa Cartel, were handing out social packages of petty cash, food, and sanitizers.

[],False,,RobotWantsKitty,,,[],,,,text,t2_dg31a,False,False,"&gt; Discussing Western policy toward Russia and Ukraine is quite depressing, especially when your interlocutors are high-ranking officials in the U.S. administration. In the two weeks I spent in Washington, D.C., with each new conversation, grew not only my melancholy, but also a sense of encroaching schizophrenia. In the public arena, U.S. officials say that sanctions against Russia are ""working and destroying the Kremlin war machine,"" that the West is showing ""unprecedented unity,"" and that aid to Ukraine ""will surpass the Marshall Plan. But conversations with the same people behind closed doors paint a much bleaker picture.
&gt; 
&gt; First of all, no one believes that sanctions will end hostilities or lead to a change in Kremlin policy any time soon. When looking for historical analogies, diplomats and the U.S. military most often recall the protracted, destructive, and bloody war in the former Yugoslavia. When talking about the effectiveness of sanctions, they cite Cuba, Iran, and the DPRK. These countries have been subjected to every possible sanction for decades, but their elites have been thriving and the money for the army and the repressive apparatus has never dried up.
&gt; 
&gt; Washington admits that sanctions are now just an emotional response tool.
&gt; 
&gt; Each round of conflict leads to new restrictions against Russia, but the officials have no opportunity to say ""Stop, let's not escalate it"": otherwise Congress will take over the sanctions machine and the Joe Biden team would like to avoid it. And the window for diplomacy is closed and unlikely to open soon, my interlocutors are convinced. After all that has happened, another failed peace plan is not exactly what the Democrats need ahead of November's tough elections.
&gt; 
&gt; The lack of people in the Kremlin who would be interested in compromise is complicated by the fact that even President Vladimir Zelensky has a very narrow corridor for diplomatic maneuvering: the Ukrainians are resolute and will not accept an abandonment of their territories. And Washington can't put pressure on Kiev, given that Mr. Zelensky is extremely popular in the West. As a result, the U.S. has only to give Ukraine more and more weapons and impose sanctions.
&gt; 
&gt; Since there is no more meaningful U.S. response strategy in the real world, officials from the Biden team have no choice but to sit tight, trying to avoid escalation and minimize the negative consequences of the conflict, while also thinking about the inevitable impact of inflation on the outcome of the presidential election of 2024. Already near the end of the trip, in response to a request for a meeting, an old acquaintance, now in a position of responsibility and at the forefront of affairs, suggested: ""This is all so depressing, let's go straight to the bar. I agreed without a second thought.

The problem is not who will help Russia bypass the sanctions, but that normal economic and trade exchanges between Russia and China have been unnecessarily damaged,” said Liu Pengyu, spokesman for China’s embassy in Washington.

Liu added that the sanctions brought about a “lose-lose” situation for all parties and made “the already difficult world economy worse.”

Beijing’s public support for Russia has not faltered. China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, on Wednesday reaffirmed its commitment to Moscow during a virtual meeting that was also attended by his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. Wang said China is willing to work with Russia to promote “real democracy,” alluding to a Chinese foreign policy goal of countering what it has described as U.S. hegemony in global politics.

Russia has not requested “weapons and ammunition” to support its war, the Chinese officials said, but declined to comment on whether Russia had requested other items that could be used in military operations including technology and supplies.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that the United States has not seen any “systematic effort” by China to help Russia evade sanctions, nor has it seen any significant military support from China to Russia.

Blinken, speaking at a Council on Foreign Relations event commemorating the centennial of Foreign Affairs magazine, noted a “remarkable exodus of companies from Russia” as a result of the invasion — 7,800 companies, Blinken said, that “didn’t want their reputations to be at risk by doing business in Russia.”

The sanctions themselves did not drive the exodus, Blinken said. “It was really companies deciding on their own that they were not going to do business as usual in a country that was committing this kind of aggression. That’s something I think that China also has to factor in as it thinks about its relationship with Russia.”

China has balked at helping Russia evade sanctions, fearing the United States and it allies could cut China off from critical technology, including semiconductors and aerospace equipment, as well as target its financial system, a Beijing official said. Shipments of high-end Chinese technology to Russia — including smartphones, laptops and telecommunications equipment — have plummeted since the war began.

Nonetheless, the Chinese maintain that the U.S. and Western sanctions are illegal and that China will continue to do business with Russia. “The Chinese side is willing to fulfill its commitments to the Russian side, and is doing that when suitable conditions are met,” said the person in Beijing familiar with the discussions.

Asked about U.S. warnings that China would face consequences if it aids Russia, the person said, “The true reason is to sow discord between the Chinese side and the Russian side … that will not happen. They will not succeed in undermining the China-Russian relationship.”

The Chinese official noted, however, that the war in Ukraine had dragged on much longer than expected, and Beijing has made clear to Moscow that an end to the conflict would allow China more leeway to oppose sanctions and grow business ties inside Russia in the wake of the exodus of foreign firms.

Bonnie Glaser, director of the Asia Program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, said, “I think that the hope of the United States and Europe is that China will be forced to choose [between siding with Russia or with the West] and that it will make the right choice. But China has competing interests, and it will be virtually impossible to compel them to place their long-standing support for territorial integrity and sovereignty above their relationship with Russia.”

Yun Sun, co-director of the East Asia Program at the Stimson Center, said “The whole purpose of standing with Russia is they want Russia to work with them in strategic alignment against the U.S.” But by abiding by Western sanctions, after all the public support it has given Russia, Beijing runs the risk of undermining its relationship with Moscow.

A second Chinese official said that discussions among high-level officials have emphasized fast-tracking Russian ventures inside China to cement closer ties while minimizing the risk to Beijing. And open source documents show that Russian-linked projects inside China are forging ahead.

Domestic Chinese bidding documents show that financing for new construction on the strategically significant Russia-China Eastern Route gas pipeline has continued since the war began, with fresh purchases for materials and machinery earmarked for the southern leg of the project. It is expected to provide 18.9 billion cubic meters of Russian gas to China’s economically vibrant Yangtze Delta region by 2025.

China’s Institute of Atomic Energy in April also purchased new services and equipment from Russian nuclear engineering firm OKBM Afrikantov for the Russian-built China Experimental Fast Reactor (CEFR) nuclear project near Beijing, documents show. In the same period, it purchased new supplies and services from Russian state atomic energy firm Rosatom for the Tianwan Nuclear Power Plant, a landmark Sino-Russian project under construction in China’s Jiangsu province.

Municipal and provincial governments have also been directed by Beijing to launch projects to expand trade and financial ties with Russia, according to the Beijing officials and domestic bidding documents filed in China.

“Based on the comparative advantages of location and resources, we will analyze the favorable factors and obstacles of regional cooperation between Dalian and the Russian Far East … so as to promote the high-quality economic development,” stated one May 19 document outlining funding for research into investment opportunities in Russia for the northeastern Chinese manufacturing and port hub of Dalian, which is located close to the Russian border.

Chinese officials also said senior leadership had called for new investment and trade with Belarus, which has been targeted with financial and defense sanctions linked to its supporting role in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Bidding documents and contracts issued in April and May show Chinese companies continued to make shipments to the China-Belarus Industrial Park, a logistic hub outside Minsk, Belarus, that was created as part of strategic agreement between the two countries. Over half of the companies in the park are financed by China, according to data released in Chinese state media in May.

Further bidding documents released on May 20 outline plans by a subsidiary of state-owned technology giant China Electronics Technology Group (CETC) to launch a $30 million project for a China-Belarus joint research laboratory that will study and test of electromagnetic pulse (EMP) equipment — a technology with military applications. The project includes an 11,000-square-foot research base and an array of EMP equipment.

CETC and its subsidiaries have already been placed on the U.S. Commerce Department’s Entity List, which restricts exports to listed companies, for their cooperation with the Chinese military.",8fdb6b3da67ba43645aa253d4617e1947c6b3539,True,False,,,,,0,1654273827,,0,{},ib1xto3,False,t3_v3xszf,False,True,t1_ib1xt4u,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v3xszf/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_03_2022/ib1xto3/,1654273843,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654245027.0,

Russian officials have raised increasingly frustrated requests for greater support during discussions with Beijing in recent weeks, calling on China to live up to its affirmation of a “no limits” partnership made weeks before the war in Ukraine began. But China’s leadership wants to expand assistance for Russia without running afoul of Western sanctions and has set limits on what it will do, according to Chinese and U.S. officials.

Moscow has on at least two occasions pressed Beijing to offer new forms of economic support — exchanges that one Chinese official described as “tense.” The officials familiar with the talks spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the matter’s sensitivity.

They declined to share specifics of Russia’s requests, but one official said it included maintaining “trade commitments” predating the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, and financial and technological support now sanctioned by the United States and other countries.

“China has made clear its position on the situation in Ukraine, and on the illegal sanctions against Russia,” said a person in Beijing with direct knowledge of the discussions. “We understand [Moscow’s] predicament. But we cannot ignore our own situation in this dialogue. China will always act in the best interest of the Chinese people.”

China is in a bind as it seeks to help its most important strategic partner, which started a war that Beijing did not anticipate would now be entering its fourth month, Chinese and U.S. officials said. They said that President Xi Jinping has tasked his closest advisers to come up with ways to help Russia financially but without violating sanctions.

“That has been difficult,” said a senior U.S. official. “And it is insufficient from the Russian standpoint.”

The U.S. official said that China has tried to find “other opportunities” diplomatically, and through joint military exercises, to bolster Russia. Last week, Russia and China flew strategic bombers over the Sea of Japan and East China Sea while President Biden was in Tokyo, wrapping up his first trip to Asia. It was their first joint military exercise since the invasion of Ukraine and a pointed signal of the growing strategic partnership between Moscow and Beijing.

“What China is trying to do is to be with Russia, signal neutrality publicly and not be compromised financially,” the U.S. official said. “Many of those goals are contradictory. It’s hard to fulfill them at the same time.”

The Russian embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment.

China has called for an end to the war but has refused to join a global consortium of countries in imposing sanctions on Moscow, instead laying blame for the conflict on the United States and NATO expansion in Europe.",fe0d08a86d623e9c0ebebb2b3e92249361010a92,True,False,,,,,0,1654273821,,0,{},ib1xt4u,False,t3_v3xszf,False,True,t3_v3xszf,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v3xszf/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_03_2022/ib1xt4u/,1654273836,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654245021.0,

There have been great issues supplying 152mm shells (the west doesn't make them, Ukraine's supply has never recovered from losing the factroy in Donansk) which has badly effected the artillery fire rate. But with 200 or so 155mm tubes already in country and the expectation that this can be bubbled over the month, Ukraine will have a strong core of superior artillery. This will also allow some of the 152s to leave the line, increasing the supply of shells per gun and making them better, 

On grain, I think we should just let anybody sell it as they can. I don't care if its stolen, document the theft and move on- There are frozen assets to pay for it when its time to figure the butchers bill.


As a huge Kherson booster, I'm incredibly frustrated by the lack of info. It's pretty clear at this point that the main Ruussian strength is the shitload of artillery all those BTGs have brought to the area- Their mootorized companies may have been toast for weeks, but every time a new BTG is sent in it brings another artillery company or even battalion. But the area seems perfect for drones and 155mm counter battery fires. Why hasn't this happened yet? Did all the 155s go to the Donbas?

In the Donbas, Lysychansck will be the gut check.  Sieverodonetsk  was/is war the Russian way:A salient, surrounded on 3 sides, unlimited artillery munitions supplied direct from the rail head, an enemy unable to supply effectively and who's artillery is laregely out of range. But once back to the big L, much of this is flippe. There's a river to cross (and,well, we're all aware of the issues Russia's had with their water polo team this season), There's an altitude variance and  (this is important) no salient. Ukrainian troops are better supplied here as supplies have been stockpiled now for weeks and the line of battle is well within their artillery reach. Russian artillery must be regroup and spread along the line, and the extra 5-10 miles from the supply depot, while not a deal breaker, is an issue.  And so the gut check: Is the Russian way of war going to win the Donbas, or will it fail when forced to go toe to toe? If Russia can cross the river and assemble troops in force, and take the big L, they can win this thing (for a certain value of win).

It depends on an aerial defense network able to blunt the majority of Western airpower.  Russia's A2AD network doesn't appear anywhere near as formidable as originally made out to be, especially given their demonstrated competency levels throughout all branches.

Everyone agrees that near-100% EV cars will be reality, the only disagreement is on when, and who will be selling them. I agree that it's very likely that EU will do some partial backtrack, but it will likely be still very hostile to ICE sales, with heavy additional taxes and only some categories of ICEs allowed.

EV infrastructure is weak in most countries now, but it's an easy transition.

His intelligence background and political skill have allowed him to keep Russia's influence on the world stage, and even expand it as he draws countries into his sphere of influence. This is usually through providing military support to a variety of corrupt dictators. Not only that, but a lot of people, particularly in the former USSR look up to Putin as a strong leader who is able to get more done than their own leaders.

However he's taken this too far. The ""soft"" power that Putin holds cannot easily be converted into military power. Just because people respect you doesn't mean that they're willing to fight and die for you. Even in Russia where his approval is on a high, he's still struggling to find volunteers to fill up the spaces in his battered military units. Despite big claims, his ""allies"" haven't provided any serious military manpower, and some are rapidly distancing themselves.

There are other limitations to this soft power.

Putin, despite all his influence, never managed to sell the Russian ideal of all being part of a great state. Notice how even his old gains in Georgia are still independent, and have no interest in unifying.

&gt;I don't. 2 years ago, Ukraine was even weaker, most of the west was locked down due to a pandemic, and Trump was in the white house.

The entire war is a blunder, what I wrote in the rest of the paragraph is that the economic indicators that weren't there then, are here now, and they are making active use of it, even if Ukraine was weaker then, 2 years later they realized that waiting even longer was going to be costlier than to attack later...

The long-term is an issue however, let's not forget China's property bubble. Whatever is being hidden from the public's eye cannot be ignored. We have no idea what state of the economy China is in and while it has strong tools to address issues, we will know something went wrong when we are already seeing the effects. This bubble has burst already, and it will take some time for us to see the effects. Economically weaker China will probably cause issues in Russia as well, however they definitely will keep buying both gas and oil from Russia.


**Third**, the US. Midterms and eventually presidential elections are coming. While plenty news sources kept publishing articles that the good state of the economy during Trump's presidency was not his work, rather Obama's, I believe they will try to blame Trump for the bad state we find ourselves in. This might be partially true due to the continuous, seemingly never-ending quantitative easing during his term. This left FED without the 'ammunition' so-to-speak to address the inflation issue and plenty people in higher positions keep talking about how a recession is a necessary evil in this case to slow down the overheated economy and to route the likely upcoming stagflation. Stagflation following with recession WILL have a tremendous impact on Biden's and even democrats' support from the Americans. Trump has created a stranglehold on the Republicans' party in numerous ways making it almost certain he will be their 2024 candidate. This might have a significant impact on funding and helping Ukraine, which actually Trump armed before the conflict with heavy weaponry. This in turn will leave a very sour taste in the mouths of Ukrainians. 

Trump might NOT be that anti-Ukrainian, as he did plenty for Ukraine (albeit perhaps not enough in some people's eyes), but the circumstances he will find himself in will make sure he will play the anti-Ukrainian card, simply because it is THE anti-Biden and anti-Democrat card to play, simply because it IS going to be the proper play to garner votes. Fox News and Tucker Carlson's rhetoric is that the US aid is wasting billions of taxpayers' money and making the US army understrength and unprepared for China, funnelling tens of billions to Ukraine which is notoriously corrupt. I think this is a good indication of what the Republicans will be focusing on during the upcoming presidential elections. ""America First"" will once again be the priority number one, eroding the US standing in the global order once again, but I cannot really imagine if it will be a version ""on steroids"" or a watered down one.",2c47e1aa0beda8058af355247fa563af3cb7f49e,True,False,,,,,0,1654247059,,0,{},ib0m760,False,t3_v3789l,False,True,t1_ib0m29i,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v3789l/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_02_2022/ib0m760/,1654247076,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654218259.0,
[],False,,daLok1nho,,,[],,,,text,t2_tea00,False,False,"Recession might be around the 'corner' and plenty of people are overlooking the geopolitical impact of what a recession just might cause to Ukraine, the war it's waging, the EU and even the US. I thought I'd mention it because it's extremely vital to the current order. 

**First**, Ukraine's GDP has contracted heavily, ~50% of its GDP. Recession might be coming within months or a year or two, or has already come to the global markets and we just don't know it yet (there is a lot to look at and it always is marked after it has started, several indicators of an incoming recession have already flashed incl. the yield curve). A recession might have a limited effect, or a devastating effect on the already destroyed Ukrainian economy. This was Russia's strategic goal and it has secured a victory on its front. Eastern Ukraine was and is an industrial thus economically vital zone of Ukraine that contributes heavily to its manufacturing % of its GDP. Numerous military industries were completely wiped out by missile and even artillery strikes. Exports of heavy military or industrial machinery is thus mostly a no-go and is now relying on agricultural exports to prop itself up (namely the blocked wheat issue as an e.g.). Even agricultural buildings however were and have been targetted. 

- Financial ruin of Ukraine is in Russia's interest. Driving Ukrainians out of Ukraine into EU countries to build resentment towards Ukrainians and the eventual (at least in the minds of Russian leaders) ""de-symphatization"" (apologies for the lack of lexicon) towards Ukraine's war efforts is something that Russia believes in, regardless of Ukraine's ""Europeanness"" and cultural compatibility. A recession will exacerbate this resentment, especially in countries that are densely populated with Ukrainians. The biggest issue is, more Ukrainians are coming back home than they are leaving, at least per reports. What this means however is that it is yet another propaganda material for anti-Ukrainian sentiment, and those that stay will be blamed for economic migration, the same thing that millions of Middle-Eastern, Far-Eastern and North African migrants were accused of.",773e24d5f305518592190f58e7b94097e8478cf9,True,False,,,,,0,1654246933,,0,{},ib0m29i,False,t3_v3789l,False,True,t3_v3789l,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v3789l/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_02_2022/ib0m29i/,1654246949,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654218133.0,

China isn’t trying to make Russia collapse or bleed out, and they do have blame Russia for what has happened since the age of sail. 

China and Russia have complimentary resources, industries, militaries, strategic locations, economic interests, and increasingly, security concerns. Either one failing or destabilizing could be a big problem for the other. China and Russia, when faced with us having a policy that it’s effectively aimed at both of them like we do, are the definition of natural allies. 

If they weren’t natural allies, then it shouldn’t be hard to think or ways to keep some space between them. To be fair it is harder now after how our leadership has handled these past few years, but that’s the fault of people who committed us to these rough relationships without appreciating the consequences. The key is to stop trying to dominate and predict everything and set more achievable goals. 

I don’t mind China and Russia having relations, even good ones. I don’t mind them being partners in some areas. There isn’t much we can do about that, not without driving them closer together under our own common threat, but we can stop behaving like a common threat. It’s not like relations between three powers is new in power politics.

We need to talk to everyone and make offers until we find a way to avoid the worst case of uniting other great powers against us, and we need to be people others want to deal with. Focusing always on Europe first keeps losing us friends. We can’t keep ignoring our own domestic issues, our own economic needs and basic diplomacy acting as if we’ll just bomb people to get out of things.

Just for the record, the whole ""ship spins when firing its guns"" thing is an old wives tale similar to the ""battleship being shoved sideways when it fired a broadside"" fable.

The Novgorod was just over 100 feet across and weighed 2500 tons. Her two 11"" guns were located about 10' to either side of her centerpoint, which didn't allow for much momentum to be applied to the ship. Truth be told, they could have been out on the extreme edges of the ship and it wouldn't be enough.

The two round warships each served for around 30 years, hardly the sign of incompetent ships. They were still not great ships, just not for the reasons everybody thinks.

They were awful at dealing with rough waters. Anything more than the waves raised by a light wind would slow them down drastically; waves that a normal hull would cut through could actually bring the round ships to a dead stop, even with their engines at full tilt. The guns were slow to load, with a recoil that was too strong for their turntable locks... that's probably the origin of the spinning idea, because the turntables would rotate if their locks failed.

However, they carried a lot of armor for their tonnage, up to 16 inches on the sides in two layers, separated by 16 inches of teak. The deck had three inches.  All of this on a ship that weighed 2500tons for *Novgorod*, 3600tons for *Vitse-admiral Popov.*

Most of the criticism is based on completely false assumptions. This sentiment is pretty much exclusive to Twitter, Reddit, Youtube comments.

The truth is that both Italy and France have provided a lot of military support, and Germany's military is in a decayed state. Keep in mind, you don't see Ukrainian officials bashing Italy or France.

By doing exactly what we're doing right now. 

The Chinese-Russian alliance, such as it exists right now, is based not upon ideology but rather on mutual self interest. Both China and Russia believe they would gain from seeing the end of the US lead liberal world order, or at least both Putin and Xi Jinping believe they would personally benefit from it. Neither really cares if the other profits or loses in the process, so long as they themselves are strengthened. They will only work together insomuch as both have something to gain.

So you need to put Russia and China into a position where in order for one to aid the other, it must make sacrifices for itself. That shoves a wedge into the single biggest crack between the two. China isn't interested in weakening itself just so Russia can get something, and Russia isn't interested in doing the reverse either. Putting the two in that situation will immediately lead to argument, conflicts, and paranoia as each suspects this is a way to gain power at the expense of the other.

Which is exactly what's happening right now with Russia's war in Ukraine. The West have put a series of rather punishing sanctions on Russia, that if China breeches will lead to economic losses on their part. China is unwilling to take that pain just to let Russia play empire. Very unwilling. In fact China has been one of the better secondary nations about following the sanctions, much better than India. And that has to be playing in Putin's mind as some sort of nefarious plot, that this is a way to weaken Russia into becoming nothing more than China's gas station, because that's exactly what he would do if the positions were reversed. At the vary least it puts a lot of doubt about Xi Jinping willingness to sacrifice his soldier's lives for Russia, if he won't even send military equipment now in Russia's time of desperate need.

The longer the West holds firm on their sanctions, and the more Ukraine wins, the deeper that wedge grows. I have zero doubt Xi Jinping would rather see Russia humiliated, driven from the Donbass and even Crimea, than face the loss of Western investment money and trade. Proving that would damage the Russia-China ""alliance"" more than anything else.",e1272b9af113b93a4deab50af52efdc9b618b68d,True,False,,,,,0,1654225256,,0,{},iazrqf3,False,t3_v3jhvg,False,True,t1_iayta21,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v3jhvg/russia_is_down_but_its_not_outdespite_its/iazrqf3/,1654225272,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654196456.0,

Key Takeaways

Russian operations to advance on Slovyansk from the southeast of Izyum and west of Lyman continue to make little progress and are unlikely to do so in the coming days, as Russian forces continue to prioritize Severodonetsk at the expense of other axes of advance.
Russian forces continued assaults against Severodonetsk and Lysychansk in order to claim full control of Luhansk Oblast.

Russian forces made incremental advances around Avdiivka.

Ukrainian counteroffensives in northwestern Kherson Oblast pushed Russian forces to the eastern bank of the Inhulets River and will likely continue to disrupt Russian ground lines of communication (GLOCs) along the T2207 highway.

The Kremlin continued to pursue inconsistent occupational measures in southern Ukraine, indicating both widespread Ukrainian resistance and likely Kremlin indecision on how to integrate occupied territory.",8d352b4375d0c5c57d6f7a830624acb1496b370d,True,False,,,,,0,1654219908,,0,{},iazggsu,False,t3_v3789l,False,True,t3_v3789l,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v3789l/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_02_2022/iazggsu/,1654219925,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654191108.0,

No country, or even group of countries, could hope to match the United States in all domains and all theaters. There is no conceivable conflict in which the United States does not come out ahead overall of it chooses to compete (yes, including a Chinese invasion of Taiwan). America's expeditionary warfare capability is truly unmatched. It is capable of knocking over a regional power at peacetime strength, like Iraq in 1991 or 2003, even one far from its own borders. It might still struggle with an insurgency as much as anyone else though.

China stands a level below the USA, capable of contesting American dominance in certain areas but only at grave cost to itself. A theoretical Chinese conflict with America over Taiwan would inflict severe economic and political costs on China, far outweighing anything experienced by the US. Its capacity for victory in that scenario is based primarily on its willingness to suffer greater pain than the America for its goals, and by threatening to deal enough damage that supporting Taiwan isn't worth it to the American government. China is capable of toppling a regional power like Taiwan if it's right along its own borders, but only with a truly wartime effort (and I will fight anyone who says China could just roll over Taiwan at peacetime strength).

Below that you have the UK, France, Japan and the like. Advanced economies and American allied, they can afford to build up fairly large expeditionary forces.Not really capable of contesting the USA militarily, but could probably defeat Russia or China in a defensive war. They probably aren't capable of toppling a major regional power, but can take over a developing nation pretty much anywhere in the world. Kind of a regional power+

Then you have the regional powers like Ukraine or Turkey. Capable of holding their own in a defensive war against a China or a Russia, or taking over a developing nation right on their borders if they really expend major effort towards it.

And finally you have the developing nations, whose security policy primarily relies on not pissing off any of the above players too much.

Russia planned this war like it was situated just below the USA, capable of taking down a regional power at peacetime strength so long at it was right along its border, when it is really somewhere between China and the UK. It probably could have taken over Ukraine if it had fully mobilized, formed a detailed plan, marshaled all its resources, etc. But it's clear Russia lacks the economic staying power to make America reconsider its support for Ukraine in the same way China might with Taiwan.",a979cb3d2515d44bda0ca6fc7e65c2a9cde1b6ba,True,False,,,,,0,1654217601,,0,{},iazbnfc,False,t3_v39z79,False,True,t1_iayqtre,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v39z79/not_built_for_purpose_the_russian_militarys/iazbnfc/,1654217618,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654188801.0,

If you look at Tesla as a car company, and think switching ICE car production to EV car production is straightforward, then the valuations make no sense.

If you look at them as leading EV company, major energy company, and a tech leader in driverless cars, then these valuations aren't crazy. Still optimistic af, but it's the reference frame investors are using.
