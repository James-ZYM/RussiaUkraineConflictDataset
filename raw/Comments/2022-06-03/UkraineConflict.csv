You see he volunteered to fight for Ukraine!  

It was his first mission out on patrol as a scout.  

His unit traveled east.  Spotted a disorganized Russian troop of six soldiers trying to hand wash clothes and start a fire to dry the clothes.  Called in a artillery strike!  His Sargent compliments him. 

Later.  He finds a two of Russia. Soldiers savaging repair parts from destroyed vehicles.  Shoots them dead. Sargent compliments him again! 

On there way back they stop to search a destroyed village for survivors.  Find two small children under ten years old.  Also found a fresh bottle of vodka.  So he takes the children and vodka to his vehicle.  Reassuring the children they are safe.  

The rest of his unit has not returned.  Timmy needs to use the bathroom. He walks around out of sight to take a piss.

Well....somehow, over a company of Russian soldiers (he lost count after 20) start advancing on the truck half naked and foaming from the mouth like crazed zombies.  

Timmy springs to action.  Defending his vehicle and the children.  Killing seven Russian soldiers with his knife and barehands even!!!

84 Russian soldiers killed by him single handedly!

Well his unit returns ready to help.  But his Sargent is angry at him.  Swearing and calling him a stupid ignorant American redneck with no intelligence at all. 

Timmy was very confused and ask ""what did I do wrong?""

In addition, 8 M270A1s have been given by Germany and the UK. 

In the peacetime US Army, HIMARS crewmembers require 4 weeks of advanced individual training. It's almost certain that there are now 12 trained Ukrainian crews operating these.

Double up the crews, quiz on translated manuals till the wee hours, and in 2-4 weeks there may be 24 crews. 30 of these would give a 6 MLRS battery to each Ukrainian artillery brigade. 90 of these would create a three battery battalion in each. 

Contrary to theprufeshanul above, they're not particularly vulnerable. A 70 km range means that they can sit 30 km behind the front, beyond the range of most Russian artillery. When a counter-battery radar 5 km behind the front geolocates a firing Russian battery, these can lob 2-3 M30s or M30A1s at the Russian battery's grid, and displace. I expect that with only 12 units at present, unless there's an unusual concentration of Russian troops/trucks, counterbattery fires will be their primary assignment. They're ideal for attacks on area targets, like artillery firing lines, but their unitary warheads are overkill for either close fire support or attacks on individual vehicles.",1d27e44422fb00626869b7701728743d879d698a,True,False,,,,,0,1654288542,,0,{},ib2ttkk,False,t3_v3ybbi,False,True,t1_ib1pp9z,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/v3ybbi/us_confirms_delivery_to_ukraine_of_4_m142_himars/ib2ttkk/,1654288557,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1654259742.0
