Russia are facing a NATO trained, equipped and funded army are they not?

The invasion started Feb 24th - that puts us two months into the conflict.

Si you tell me how it compares. Timeline would have been quite different had Russia and the Warsaw Pact been fighting a proxy war using the Iraqi army don’t you think? 

We know now that Russia committed 3ok troops to Kiev - in other words, never enough to conquer and occupy it but enough to pin 100k Ukrainian forces there defending it. A masterful feint which was so successful you (even now) don’t realise your pants were pulled down.

[],False,,ApokalypseCow,,,[],,,,text,t2_3lvdk,False,False,"&gt; It's not 1986 anymore.

After the 2008 downsizing, and the proliferation of weapons specifically designed to defeat Russian and Soviet vehicles and armor?  You're right, it's not 1986 anymore, because back then, *Russia might have actually been a threat* given the comparative military strengths at the time.

&gt; Russia is fighting, essentially an American NATO force, and they are winning across the country.

Retreating on every front is winning to you?  How many dead Russian Generals are you up to now?  Your guys have been pushed back so close to their own borders that Ukraine is using Tochkas and hitting targets *inside Russia*, nevermind the shitty air defenses that let a pair of Ukrainian helicopters through a few weeks back to blow up a fuel depot...

&gt; Russia is fighting, essentially an American NATO force...

Minus American small arms, American tanks, American aircraft (fixed-wing and rotary both), American air defense systems other than the Stinger MANPAD, American logistics systems, American radar systems, American defensive emplacements, years of training American officers go through, American encrypted radio systems, American drones (other than the Switchblades), and more...  and even without all of that Ukraine's forces are still kicking Russian ass from Kyiv to the edge of the Donbass.

&gt; If Russia DOES beat the Ukrainians...

Never happen.  The best they can hope for at this point is a stalemate at the edge of the Donbass and a protracted stalemate of low-to-moderate intensity conflict, which Russia can ill-afford at this time.  They've propped up their currency by forcing people to buy it, they've propped up their stock market by refusing to let anyone sell on it, and they've tried to fight their absurd inflation by raising interest rates to equally absurd levels...  and failing.  Russia's economy cannot take this as a protracted matter, it wasn't even as big as Texas's economy before, and GDP projections are making their situation even worse.  They are rapidly headed towards stagflation, to say nothing of the death of much of their domestic industry.  There was not enough fat in their economy to support this war effort in the first place, and their only golden goose was their petroleum exports...  which now they must trade to China and India for a pittance.  Their own foreign currency reserves have been depleted to try to keep up the charade of a strong Russian economy, but that candle has almost burnt out.  Purchasing power parity won't help here either, because at the end of the day, the common Russian is going to come face to face with Economics Rule #1: **you can't eat money**.

Meanwhile, everything the Ukraine has gotten from the US to this point?  It's a drop in the bucket to us.  Our military and economic aid to Ukraine is *a rounding error* compared to what we could actually bring to bear against Russia, in either an economic or a military sense.  Our economy has so much fat in it that turning twice as much of our GDP towards the military as it is doing today wouldn't make most of us sweat.

As Clausewitz said, war is the continuation of policy by any other means.  Modern war is not just the use of military force, it is the use of information and economic force, and in those arenas, the Russians are not at all prepared to face the West.",91d3d26badbebf5845bbc683385314fa1176f40c,True,False,,,,,0,1651011323,,0,{},i6bp85e,False,t3_uc5i4z,False,True,t1_i6awitb,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/uc5i4z/russia_warns_nuclear_war_risks_now_considerable/i6bp85e/,1651011338,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1650982523.0,

Russian oil has been seeping its way back into Europe in recent weeks, as Western oil traders work around the energy’s undesirable reputation.

Even as sanction threats and bad publicity mount, oil has been discretely leaving Russia in tankers headed to “destination unknown,” and European oil traders have been buying it up under the radar. Over the course of April, an average of 1.6 million barrels of oil have left Russia every day, heading to unknown destinations, TankerTrackers.com found.

According to a new report by the Wall Street Journal, the practice is increasing, with more than 11.1 million barrels of oil loaded into tankers without a planned route in April—up from almost zero before the Ukraine war began.

Despite there being no formal sanctions by the EU banning the import of Russian oil, European oil traders have so far self-sanctioned themselves from buying Russian energy, fearing it would be seen as funding the government that has been accused of war crimes. But now, six weeks since Russia first invaded Ukraine, Russia’s cheap oil is proving to be too alluring for Europe oil traders to stay away from.

##Where is ‘destination unknown’?

The use of the “destination unknown” label means the oil is being taken to larger ships at sea and mixed in with oil from other destinations, confusing its origin. It’s a long-running practice first used by other sanctioned countries including Iran and Venezuela.

Traders told the Wall Street Journal that the oil, dubbed “the Latvian blend” and “the Turkmenistani blend,” are being offered in the market with the understanding they are mixed with substantial amounts of Russian oil.

The practice of “destination unknown” oil shipping is similar to other spotty practices developed to hide the purchase of Russian oil. Dark activity, or when ships turn off their transponders for several hours, has increased by 600% since the invasion of Ukraine, according to maritime risk management company Windward.

Russian oil’s negative reputation comes with good reason. Oil sales are a crucial part of Russia’s economy, and its ongoing sales of oil and gas are directly contributing to its war in Ukraine, critics say. Russia’s oil and gas revenue last year brought in $119 billion for the Kremlin, helping fund the country’s military expenditures of around $62 billion per year.

The U.S., Canada, the U.K., and Australia have banned Russian oil outright—but the EU, which is far more dependent on Russian energy, importing 27% of its oil from the country, has yet to decide whether to impose its own embargo. 

The EU has, however, committed to slashing Russian gas imports by two-thirds within a year, even as energy prices surge across the bloc. Its 27 member nations are set to release a proposal in mid-May that will outline a plan to cut Russian oil, gas, and coal completely by 2027. 

##Oil on offer

As energy prices in Europe soar, Russian crude oil known as Urals is being traded at a $30 discount to Brent, leading some to keep the Russian energy flowing. Barrels of oil headed to Romania, Estonia, Greece, and Bulgaria doubled this month compared to March, and volumes headed to the Netherlands, the biggest European buyer of Russian gas, also rose substantially.

“The European Union fully sanctioning Russian oil would be like saying, ‘Tomorrow you cut your salary by 40% and you need to continue to live as if nothing has happened,” Giovanni Staunovo, a commodity analyst at UBS Group, told the Wall Street Journal.

He added, “In the meantime, there are huge discounts for Russian oil in the market. Some will find this environment very attractive.”",f712304b60d8c3b617d790a55aa4ad4bffb866b2,True,False,,,,,0,1651003838,,0,{},i6b7d29,True,t3_uclf9q,False,True,t3_uclf9q,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/uclf9q/russia_is_relabeling_oil_tankers_destination/i6b7d29/,1651003854,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1650975038.0,

NATO used to spend a lot of time practising a front-facing defence but, guess what? It's not 1986 anymore. All NATO countries have severely cut back on their armed forces capacity and training. 

Germany, which you mentioned, is an international joke, it's armed forces have been described as 2catastrophic"" by Martin Schulz. the Minister responsible now runs the European Commission as its president. [Here's](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-biggest-enemy-threadbare-army-bundeswehr/) an article for you to have a look at from [politico.eu](https://politico.eu) from 2019 which sets out just how comically bad their armed forces are.

Let's be truthful. 

Russia is fighting, essentially an American NATO force, and they are winning across the country. NATO countries are literally running out of munitions to send - America has more but has severe shortages of Javelin missiles now for its own stock.

The Baltic states could barely mustre up any significant force between them. The UK has been cut back so severely it could probably gather together a brigade's worth of men for a rapid deployment.

You're just brainwashed from watching the BBC and CNN. ""Top down heavy structure with no NCOs"" LMFAO.

&gt; LVIV, Ukraine/KYIV, April 26 - Russia told the world not to underestimate the considerable risks of nuclear war that it said it wanted to reduce and warned that conventional Western weapons were legitimate targets in Ukraine, where battles raged in the east.

&gt; Lavrov said: &amp;quot;NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.""

A top human rights lawyer in charge of gathering evidence to prosecute Russia for war crimes has said troops have “tacit permission” to rape civilians.

Baroness Kennedy of The Shaws, who is part of a legal taskforce helping to build war crimes cases in Ukraine, said evidence so far shows “serious offences of a grievous kind” have been committed by Russian troops against citizens.

Speaking to Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme, she said: “One of the things is that a change has taken place internationally in the recognition of rape as a weapon of war and what that means is not that an instruction is given from the top to go out there and rape citizens, women and girls and anybody else, but it’s about the sort of tacit permission that’s given.

“(It’s) the way in which no-one is brought to book or called into line or disciplined and so that gives an immunity to soldiers on the ground they know that this is permissible.

“So what we have heard, and evidence is being gathered, is that serious offences of a grievous kind have been committed against citizens, against women and girls and that’s a new thing, in recognition and in investigating and in making sure that it properly reported.”

Reports of rape adds to a growing body of evidence of war crimes in the war-torn country.

The Metropolitan Police’s War Crimes Team, a unit within its counter-terrorism command (CTC), said it had already received around 50 referrals from people with a link to the UK, including those who have directly fled the conflict in the last two months since Russia began invading.

Baroness Kennedy said: “There are many crimes, we’ve witnessed them on our news: bombing residential areas, bombing hospitals and orphanages, the business of bombing the theatre where it was quite clear that citizens, civilians, were in hiding and the word children was plastered on the ground so any aerial bombardment could see what they were dealing with and yet they bombed that place to smithereens, those are crimes.”

However, she added that bringing prosecutions will be “very difficult” as Russia or China could, in the United Nations, veto a move to put a case before the International Court of Justice, so lawyers may have to explore alternatives.

The International Criminal Court has “already embarked upon an investigation”, she said.

When asked about the possibility of prosecuting Russian president Vladimir Putin himself, she said: “That is always more difficult until you have victory by Ukraine and the aftermath of that, it’s very difficult to bring leaders to justice.”

“I think we’re looking carefully at what the steps would have to be but we’re long way from that.”

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss announced sweeping sanctions against Russia in response to reports of “atrocities”.

She said at the time: “Together with our allies, we are showing the Russian elite that they cannot wash their hands of the atrocities committed on Putin’s orders. We will not rest until Ukraine prevails.”",f62e496919bc1c99c384adbf40b20bacfd1f89e7,True,False,,,,,0,1650938259,moderator,0,{},i67o03a,False,t3_ubeqxd,False,True,t3_ubeqxd,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/ubeqxd/russianoccupiers_have_tacit_permission_to_rape/i67o03a/,1650938274,1,True,True,True,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1650909459.0,
