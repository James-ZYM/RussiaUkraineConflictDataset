No, it isn’t as I explained in my previous comment that you completely failed to address in this response. 

&gt; A simple example should illustrate the point plainly: In 2014, Russia's GDP at MER amounted to $2,049 billion (current USD), whereas its GDP at PPP amounted to $3,818 billion (constant 2017 international $). Russia's electricity consumption amounted to 7,977 TWh. In 2015, Russia's GDP at MER shrank to $1,357 billion (-34% year-on-year), whereas its GDP at PPP shrank to only $3,743 billion (-2.0%). Russia's electricity consumption shrank to 7,842 TWh (-1.7%).

Ok, so one example of a countries MER GDP being crushed by sanctions renders all my previous points useless?  They were sanctions put in place to heavily damage Russia’s ability to trade. 

Reference my earlier point about how a devalued currency makes your services and goods more competitive on a global market. Well it has the opposite effect when it comes to buying services, goods or resources in the global market.  The Russian economy collapsed on the global stage, it didn’t internally but that wasn’t the point of the sanctions. 

&gt; Do you think real Russian economic output in 2015 (a) contracted by 2% or (b) collapsed by 34%?

I think it’s MER was artificially crushed with sanctions. Doesn’t mean MER is not a good measure for countries that are not under economic sanctions. 

&gt; MER is obviously the better measure for trade

Clearly, and it has massive geopolitical  consequences as MER is true measure of a countries economic power in the world market. Trade is *massive*.

&gt; but I would very much dispute that it is the better metric for international relations

Trade *is* international relations. It’s why the behaviour of China nowadays or the United States in the past was tolerated.

&gt; Defense spending, for instance, is better accounted for at PPP (or better yet, by using a specific ""military PPP index""), and ultimately defense issues is what we're talking about around here.

I’d agree that the “military PPP” is probably the best for comparing military spending, although it still falls short. Higher income countries appear to get less bang for their buck, but real world experience has seemingly proven that you really do have to pay for quality. Sure the US pays more for its equipment than say Russia, but looking at Russian equipment in action, it is clear that American equipment is far superior. The same applies for the quality of soldiers as well, vast incompetence is seen in the Russian military compared to the US military.

It’s not as simple as China or Russia paying less for their soldiers and equipment. We have to understand that whilst the US pays a premium, it also gets the best out of said equipment and it’s personnel for that premium.",607f2fc74544d546cfb59cfd4d52226f1e2c3aae,True,False,,,,,0,1651016972,,0,{},i6c1l2z,False,t3_ubpxth,False,True,t1_i6buqy9,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ubpxth/operation_z_the_death_throes_of_an_imperial/i6c1l2z/,1651016986,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650988172.0

**Key Takeaways**  
  
Russian forces continue to make slow but steady progress south from Izyum and northwest of Rubizhne, but Russian offensive operations elsewhere along the line in eastern Ukraine remain unsuccessful.  
Fighting continues in Mariupol, where Ukrainian defenders apparently still hold positions beyond the Azovstal Plant.  
Russia and/or Russian proxies have staged false-flag attacks in Russian-occupied Transnistria, possibly to threaten a (very likely unsuccessful) attack on Odesa, possibly to destabilize Moldova.  


**Immediate items to watch**  
  
Russian forces will likely continue attacking southeast from Izyum, west from Kreminna and Popasna, and north from Donetsk City via Avdiivka or another axis.  
Russian forces will likely attempt to starve out the remaining defenders of the Azovstal Steel Plant in Mariupol and will not allow trapped civilians to evacuate.  
Russia may continue false-flag attacks in and around Transnistria or might move to generate a more serious crisis in Transnistria and Moldova more generally.",6bf31f2c6abcbec4296590c5a943621fc0cec082,True,False,,,,,0,1651016841,,0,{},i6c1am3,False,t3_ucawm5,False,True,t3_ucawm5,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ucawm5/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_26_2022/i6c1am3/,1651016853,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650988041.0

He was awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest military decoration awarded for valour ""in the face of the enemy"" in various Commonwealth countries. [3] He served in the Boer War, First World War, and Second World War. He was shot in the face, head, stomach, ankle, leg, hip, and ear; was blinded in his left eye; survived two plane crashes; tunnelled out of a prisoner-of-war camp; and tore off his own fingers when a doctor declined to amputate them. Describing his experiences in the First World War, he wrote, ""Frankly I had enjoyed the war.""

Also they can't really use them in the separatist regions because they'd lose support there - what's the point of destroying what you're trying to ""liberate""?

Perhaps they would see Odessa and Mykolaiv as potential targets, flatten them and roll in the tanks to get the land corridor they want. It's extremely risky though. 

Perhaps they would strike Lviv as a warning against weapons supply? Maybe that's what Lavatory is getting at actually.",162a786d3b74f0371be63cddefddc5c9e3a048c9,True,False,,,,,0,1651013895,,0,{},i6buus5,False,t3_ucawm5,False,True,t1_i6bth73,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ucawm5/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_26_2022/i6buus5/,1651013912,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650985095.0

A simple example should illustrate the point plainly:

In 2014, Russia's GDP at MER amounted to $2,049 billion (current USD), whereas its GDP at PPP amounted to $3,818 billion (constant 2017 international $). Russia's electricity consumption amounted to 7,977 TWh.

In 2015, Russia's GDP at MER shrank to $1,357 billion (-34% year-on-year), whereas its GDP at PPP shrank to only $3,743 billion (-2.0%). Russia's electricity consumption shrank to 7,842 TWh (-1.7%).

Do you think **real** Russian economic output in 2015 (a) shrank by 2% or (b) collapsed by 34%?

If Putin is so weak that only using a nuclear weapon will be a show of strength, he's already doomed. Someone that weak will not survive the internal politics of Russia because it will be obvious to everyone with half a brain that the use of a nuclear weapon is the death knell for Russia as a state. No one follows Russia if a nuke is used, especially a nuke used desperately to try and make Putin look tough. I don't think anyone should discount the nuclear threat, I worry about it constantly, but the fact of the matter is using a nuke would be so devastating for Russia it would almost beggar belief.   


&gt;Notice that here on this board, which is far better informed than the general public, most people assume that Russian nuclear weapons aren't really a credible threat at all.   


I think you are overestimating the amount of people who don't take Russia's nukes seriously. Even a lot of people who think Russia's arsenal is weaker than it looks will normally acknowledge that Russia still possesses more than enough nukes to cause a near-apocalyptic scenario. This is the other turn on what you're saying. Nobody who actually is in the know seems to be doubting Russia's nuclear threat. Based on START, America knows what Russia's nuclear capabilities are, we don't need a demonstration as a reminder. If those in power really cared nothing for Russia's nukes and were actually so dismissive a nuke needs to be used to make them see the truth, then you would see NATO establishing a no-fly zone or something akin to it. Russia knows we respect their nuclear arsenal, that's why they go back to that threat so often.  


&gt;Putin has already made one very risky and disastrous misjudgement and I suspect he has more to make before he leaves office, whether that leave-taking is feet first or otherwise.

I don't necessarily disagree with this, but I think it is a bit wrong to think that just because someone has made one poor decision means they will keep making poor decisions. Let's be fair, Putin has played his hand relatively well for the last 20 or so years. Ukraine is a massive misstep, but I think a relatively rare one all things considered. To use basic human instinct, if you put your hand on a stove and it burns you, your immediate reaction is not to put your hand back on the stove. I think Putin will pour men and resources into Ukraine, but I do not think he will escalate to nuclear war. That doesn't mean we shouldn't take the threat seriously (and the West is clearly taking it seriously) but we also can't allow ourselves to be caged simply by the rattling of the nuclear saber. Frankly, that kind of irresponsible behavior with a nuclear arsenal should not be rewarded with capitulation lest it reinforce the principle that it's ok to do exactly that.",fdeeb7b5e4e0406b32df369dc9fb99ea8ebe817d,True,False,,,,,0,1651012503,,0,{},i6bru0a,False,t3_ucawm5,False,True,t1_i6auwre,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ucawm5/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_26_2022/i6bru0a/,1651012519,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650983703.0

One aspect I'm interested in pertains to one of the main pieces of evidence used to draw conclusions in this article (which was first published in 2020)

&gt;Russia reserves the right to use nuclear weapons in response to nuclear or weapons of mass destruction use against it or its allies, and against conventional attack on the Russian Federation *when the very existence of the state is under threat*

The author points to this official doctrine as evidence that Russia would only use nuclear weapons when under an existential threat.

What happens in the case of Crimea? Crimea is internationally recognized as Ukrainian territory but has been officially integrated by Moscow into Russia. 

The definition of 'the state' is important here. Is it the borders of Russia (as recognised by the Russian government) or is it more about the functioning of the current regime from Moscow?

These questions are important to answer as they give better clarity to where the nuclear 'red line' will be drawn by Moscow. Nuking Kyiv to win a war of conquest is probably unacceptable.

&gt; * Scholars no longer regard the Civil War as total, a revision that should have absolved Sherman of waging limitless war against the South as his fiercest critics alleged, yet students of the general seem unable to escape the destroyer myth. 

&gt; * Hardly evidence of Sherman’s “conservative nature regarding military science,” the creation of the postgraduate, professional-military institutions demonstrates how critical it was for Sherman that future soldiers apply military science of the day to campaigning, all with an eye toward fighting the next large-scale war. 

&gt; * Finally, Sherman must be understood as he viewed himself: as a teacher of war. 

&gt; * …Sherman displayed great interest in professional military literature and nurtured the intellectual curiosity of officers, even penning short, analytical responses to articles he read in the *Journal of the Military Service Institution of the United States.*

&gt; * …Sherman emphasized all US Army and Navy officers should read widely in times of peace on matters historical, legal, and ethical, in addition to the latest professional literature.

&gt; * While the Civil War provided the dominant paradigm for Sherman, the practical lessons he derived from the war were not unimportant. The Civil War was the first large-scale conflict in global history in which railroads found widespread use and influence in military operations. 

&gt; * Military operations in the theaters of the Civil War occurred in zones that dwarfed entire swaths of Europe. The distance from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to Richmond, Virginia for instance, exceeds the distance from Moscow to the Franco-German frontier. 

&gt; * Sherman’s successes in the war, accomplished in its most difficult theater of operations, required careful intellectual study, tremendous attention to detail, and a wealth of personal experience. 

&gt; * In the recesses of his mind were hidden immediate solutions for the minute-to-minute problems encountered during the 1864 Savannah Campaign, especially how to feed, supply, and protect his army in hostile territory. These were herculean efforts that “tax and measured forethought, energy, patience, and watchfulness” with utmost severity. Prior to the campaign, Sherman knew by county the number of horses, hogs, beeves, and bushels of corn the land contained and how best to feed his army. His memoirs are chock-full of references to provisions and the movement of men, mules, and material. Additionally, they demonstrate the empirical habit of mind required for careful mathematical tabulations. 

&gt; * Leadership for Sherman was not mere adherence to a particular theory of command that moved soldiers by moral or physical example. Rather it was a precise knowledge of an army’s integral parts and a firm understanding of how all elements combined to produce unity of action-all to the end that a commander must act to keep his army intact and project power.

&gt; * ..travel to European battlefields and to engage in careful, cooperative evaluation of military policy. Travel also afforded Sherman opportunities to ponder the character of modern warfare in an international context.

&gt; * Far from being a provincial theorist tethered to the American Civil War, Sherman possessed a cosmopolitan outlook and demonstrated a willingness to graft, wherever useful, the best of European military thought and practice his profession of arms. 

&gt; * These points have escaped Sherman biographers.

&gt; * Hoping to avoid the casualties claimed in World War I, officers of the interwar period saw in Sherman’s aversion to pitched battle a blueprint for success in future armed conflicts. 

&gt; * …Sherman summoned naval lieutenant Stephen Luce… for a war council…The plan impressed Luce, who likened to a religious conversion. 

&gt; * So inspired, Luce in 1884 helped establish the US Naval War College… and served as its first president.

&gt; * Thus Sherman… ought to be known as the father of joint professional military education.

Abstract:

&gt; For years, scholars have viewed the career of William Tecumseh Sherman in light of an antiquated destroyer myth and neglected his memoirs, which were written as a military textbook. This essay reviews Sherman’s legacy and literature, both of which contributed to the advancement of modern military thought. His experiences may serve as a prescriptive text to servicemembers, providing critical lessons on military warfare and philosophy still relevant today.

I was instead reacting (in a rather knee-jerk fashion) to what I misinterpreted as yet another instance of people acting in a way that's almost demanding for evidence from inteligence agencies. 

Regarding the two IL-76s, I agree the lack of evidence of a crash inside ukranian territory makes that less plausible. Another more likely explanation I've seen on a random twitter thread was that those planes were part of a 3 hour lighting Russian plan aimed at landing up to 10k troops in kiyv and taking over strategic locations, including radio and TV station, to try and force a collapse of the government. 

According to that thread, the plan failed in part because the ukranians knew about it and placed lots of air defence at the airport. During landing attempts, two aircraft were hit, but able to return to base, forcing the Russians to give up on the plan and direct all other aircraft to base as well. 

That makes much more sense, since the Russians did fail to land a significant force there and no wreckage was found inside ukranian territory.",cec14892f288343f8bd9e8be5ac3386539cdbd99,True,False,,,,,0,1651009459,,0,{},i6bkypu,False,t3_ucawm5,False,True,t1_i6bi5vk,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ucawm5/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_26_2022/i6bkypu/,1651009474,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650980659.0

NBC is holding back additional information it has, at the request of the US government *and* NBC is asserting the shootdown happened, not 'allegedly' happened.

I don't think they would be reporting that level of certainty unless they knew it happened.  And the reason I think they know it happened is they have multiple good sources for that claim.

&gt; As a consequence, the US submarine force today is much more capable than it was previously against hardened targets such as Russian ICBM silos. A decade ago, only about 20 percent of US submarine warheads had hard-target kill capability; today they all do. (See Figure 1.)

&gt;This vast increase in US nuclear targeting capability, which has largely been concealed from the general public, has serious implications for strategic stability and perceptions of US nuclear strategy and intentions.

&gt;Russian planners will almost surely see the advance in fuzing capability as empowering an increasingly feasible US preemptive nuclear strike capability—a capability that would require Russia to undertake countermeasures that would further increase the already dangerously high readiness of Russian nuclear forces. Tense nuclear postures based on worst-case planning assumptions already pose the possibility of a nuclear response to false warning of attack. The new kill capability created by super-fuzing increases the tension and the risk that US or Russian nuclear forces will be used in response to early warning of an attack—even when an attack has not occurred.

&gt;The increased capability of the US submarine force will likely be seen as even more threatening because Russia does not have a functioning space-based infrared early warning system but relies primarily on ground-based early warning radars to detect a US missile attack. Since these radars cannot see over the horizon, Russia has less than half as much early-warning time as the United States. (The United States has about 30 minutes, Russia 15 minutes or less.)

Since that point seems to be missed by many in this thread. A party to a contract cannot unilaterally change the essential terms of an existing contract without the other party's consent. So Gazprom is breaching their contract by refusing to abide by the existing terms. 

There are maybe two or three available defenses to breach of contract that might apply depending on the details of the contract and governing law (force majeure, government intervention, impracticability, etc), but they would all be tenuous at best. 

So that leaves Bulgaria and Poland holding the bag, but likely with some contract clause that empowers them to seek damages, likely via arbitration. I would be shocked if there isn't a liquidated damages clause, and in fact I've seen a similar-ish Gazprom contract with a private entity in a different country that did have such a clause. So the Polish and Bulgarians can probably seek damages in arbitration, and will likely win them.

Only 50%. 
https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/heating-40-million-homes-hurdles-phasing-out-fossil-fuels-german-basements

And 15% in electric generation: https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Economic-Sectors-Enterprises/Energy/Production/Tables/gross-electricity-production.html

Converting with respect to kWh on napkin math estimates yields 600/2 = 300 tWh or 300 million kWh used on heating homes in Germany. Meanwhile, 95 *billion* kWh of natural gas is used in electricity generation. Sure, it's alot more complicated to convert pipelines to the correct processors but on the surface of things the gas used for electric generation is enough to be used to heat homes instead.

&gt;Nuclear is expensive to keep and expensive to decommission (all plants have a retirement age) with incredible environmental concerns for waste

The waste is a stupid argument. It occupies no more space than a landfill and western building standards ensure that it's properly disposed of.

&gt;That money can go elsewhere like green technologies

Nuclear investment is already a tiny fraction of green technologies. Green technologies still are not effective because the storage technology is not there.

&gt;A lot of the pro-nuke people in social media don't consider the cost and time it takes to get a nuke plant going, nor the opportunity cost of doing so in regards to giving up on green technology for it.

This is so stupid. The nuke plant is already going, so there's no additional cost. The cost for a nuke plant is all upfront in construction and waste disposal plants. [Upkeep for nuclear stations is lower than renewable energy](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/economic-aspects/economics-of-nuclear-power.aspx). 

I also challenge you to identify an upcoming green energy technology that is lacking investment. There is no 'opportunity cost' like you keep harping about, because the opportunity cost was already taken: nuclear energy development has been completely stunted since Chernobyl and renewable energy cost has gone down something like 1000 fold over the last 40 years.",2041ff4577f588c2252a76b9f547968725747109,True,False,,,,,0,1651001029,,0,{},i6b03hv,False,t3_ucawm5,False,True,t1_i6arjh9,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ucawm5/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_26_2022/i6b03hv/,1651001047,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650972229.0

During the battle around Kyiv, a group of drone operators disabled the head of a Russian supply convoy. The disabled vehicles combined with the unnavigable mud surrounding the roads created the infamous 40 mile convoy. Those convoys were tasked with refueling and resupplying the mechanized groups which were responsible for surrounding Kyiv, cutting off the road and rail line in and out of the city. The delay in resupply gave Ukrainian forces time to establish defenses and successfully resist the efforts of encirclement.

It's easy to sit in front of our computers and phones and laugh at the supposedly foolish assessments of defense officials and the apparent incompetence of Russian forces, but if some small things turn out differently, it's possible we would be living in a very different reality.

No one would take that claim completely seriously, but it allows some breathing room in terms of public posture. Having (often manned) NATO aircraft openly flying sorties on Ukraine's behalf is a clear step up from that. 

It's also worth considering that both Ukraine and NATO would keep images locked down as tight as for a day or two afterwards to keep info about Ukriane's air defenses secret until it was useless. It's. It's not inconceivable that the shoot down was kept under wraps until now, just somewhat unlikely. If the same thing happened today, the US would likely be completely open about their involvement within the following days and release satellite imagery pretty quickly.

It can be hard to hide a crash from satellite imagery in peacetime, but it's a lot easier in a warzone. There's a good chance Ukriane would do everything in their power to lock down the crash site to keep camera phones away. Another possibility is that the plane was the thing shot down over Kyiv right before the shoot down was announced.

If Ukraine feels the best way to wage that war is to target infrastructure targets inside Russia to cripple the war effort -- or SAM sites, or other military targets -- then that is their prerogative.

The idea that we are not moving steadily closer to nuclear war here however strikes me as doubtful and dangerous thinking. We are. And we should therefore consider how far we would be willing to back Ukraine. Ukraine wanted us to enter a direct shooting war with Russia a few weeks ago. They asked repeatedly, and we declined, because it would have been too dangerous. The danger has not gone away simply because that particular issue (no fly zones) has been taken off the table.

If Ukraine is striking targets inside Russia with apparent impunity and Putin is forced to withdraw the army because it is melting like snow in July, that will clearly be an existential threat to his regime (not to Russia, but to the regime *in* Russia). To survive he will need to do something decisive and risky that proves that Russia actually does have to be taken seriously. Notice that here on this board, which is far better informed than the general public, most people assume that Russian nuclear weapons aren't really a credible threat at all.

U.S. intel helped Ukraine protect air defenses, shoot down Russian plane carrying hundreds of troops

Ukrainian forces have used specific coordinates shared by the U.S. to direct fire on Russian positions and aircraft, current and former officials tell NBC News.

https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/us-intel-helped-ukraine-protect-air-defenses-shoot-russian-plane-carry-rcna26015?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma

This is the first I have heard of the supposed shoot downs of Russian VDV transport planes since the first days of the war.

&gt; * That near real-time intelligence-sharing also paved the way for Ukraine to shoot down a Russian transport plane carrying hundreds of troops in the early days of the war, the officials say, helping repel a Russian assault on a key airport near Kyiv.

The gloves are off it seems. 

&gt; * Once the invasion got underway, lawyers in the U.S. defense and intelligence bureaucracy imposed guidance that in some cases limited the sharing of targeting information that could enable lethal Ukrainian strikes against Russians. But as Russia’s aggression has deepened, and under pressure from Congress, all of those impediments have been removed, officials say.",4dff14e02337a37bb086acc9dc860ab1e0e656ac,True,False,,,,,0,1650991498,,0,{},i6abd4e,False,t3_ucawm5,False,True,t3_ucawm5,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ucawm5/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_26_2022/i6abd4e/,1650991509,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650962698.0

[],False,,Wheynweed,,,[],,,,text,t2_h8vn2,False,False,"&gt; Overall GDP calculated on a PPP basis is useful for determining a country's overall economic output, absent the distortions caused by exchange rates.

No, it’s evidence of a lower cost of living. This is what I mean by goods are cheap. In developing countries, wages are low and most products are usually produced locally. This leads to a low cost of living so purchasing power is high, but low wages overall hence a *nominally* lower gdp. 

PPP is notoriously awful at estimating the overall size of a economy because it’s so difficult to truly get a idea of a entire countries economy with it because it’s so difficult to calculate. It can vary wildly within the country. 

Further PPP overestimates the size of a economy with devalued currencies, because the currency is intentionally weaker to make the counties products and services more competitive in the world stage. If the currency was valued correctly then the products and services of a neighbouring country would become more competitive and harm the real economy of the country that originally had a devalued currency. 

Exchange rates exist for a reason. For example the US effectively has a larger economy than China on the world stage. Sure China can buy a overall larger basket of goods within China than the US can buy within America. But it needs its currency to be weaker on the world stage to facilitate this domestic purchasing power, lest its economy become uncompetitive on the world stage. 

Nominal is also more relevant in international relations and trade. The price of raw materials that are traded globally will be effected by the nominal output of a nation. 

&gt; That would depend on the value of its currency.

You act like the value of a currency has no causes or effects. The nominal value of the economy is its size, competitiveness and real value to the world economic system.

1. Russia has made claims about destroyed equipment (such as the S-300 from Slovakia) in the past that were lies.

2. Their claims about destroyed Ukrainian tanks, UAVs, planes, IFVs, soldiers, etc.. has been proven false.

3. We know from combat footage that Ukraine is getting a ton of western arms to the fronts regardless of what Russia is doing.

4. Results on the ground reflect the arms being used successfully.

5. Media reporting on deliveries shows that Ukraine has a near inexhaustible supply of western supplied arms.  Attacking depots is a reasonable idea, but won't stop the flood of weapons regardless of succes. Merely slow it.

6. Even Mariupol has been resupplied with new ATGMs, reflecting an inability to interdict them by Russia. 

7. Ukraine is unlikely to store large quantities of deliveries together from a purely logical perspective, much less a military perspective.  Also, there is not a significant reason to store the arms together in large quantities from a distribution standpoint.

8. Russian airstrikes at the start of the war were ineffective and Ukraine stated this was due to faulty and dated intelligence and Russia hitting old stores, depots, and bases.  Russia's intelligence network is unlikely to have improved while Ukraine is at war with them and Ukrainian OPSEC is much higher. I have doubts they can identify enough locations properly in such a big country to make a real dent. 

9. Russia is likely relying on older, less accurate, missiles at this point, based on OSINT observations.  We also know they aren't always hitting what they're aiming for based on the targets they do strike.

9. We know there are morale issues with Russian conscripts from social media about western arms deliveries.  Saying that the deliveries are being destroyed of any effective equipment is an age-old tactic to keep up morale.

10. We aren't seeing any Ukrainian reports of shortages, or lack of arms, or destroyed depots.  While Ukrainian OSPEC is likely improving, it is a little suspicious that we haven't seen ANYTHING about this on Ukraine's side if they were suffering devastating losses in equipment.

11.  Ukraine isn't asking for more of the arms that have already been supplied with.  If Russia were hitting western arms shipments, wouldn't they need more ATGMs, etc..? Instead, Ukraine has been pushing for heavy weapons.  Why switch if you were having shortages of the equipment already supplied with?  Seems more consistent with having significant quantities of stockpiles of already supplied equipment and switching on to more complex resupply efforts.

12. if Russia had been able to interdict western arms shipments for months and are only doing it now, were they incompetent before?  Did they not have the intel before?  Why now, suddenly, after two months is Russia suddenly able to stop the deluge of western arms that are eating their army alive.

[],False,,flamedeluge3781,,,[],,,,text,t2_61s6s6hf,False,False,"Washington Post is reporting on Belarussian sabotage of their own rail network:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/04/23/ukraine-belarus-railway-saboteurs-russia/

&gt;When Russian troops first streamed across the Belarusian border into Ukraine for what they had assumed would be a lightning assault on Kyiv, they were intending to rely on the region’s extensive rail network for supplies and reinforcements.

&gt;The Russians hadn’t taken into account the railway saboteurs of Belarus.

&gt;Starting in the earliest days of the invasion in February, a clandestine network of railway workers, hackers and dissident security forces went into action to disable or disrupt the railway links connecting Russia to Ukraine through Belarus, wreaking havoc on Russian supply lines.

&gt;The attacks have drawn little attention outside Belarus amid the drama of the Russian onslaught and the bloody aftermath of Russia’s humiliating retreat. Fierce Ukrainian resistance and tactical errors by an ill-prepared Russian force were likely enough to thwart Russia’s plans, analysts say.

&gt;But the Belarus railway saboteurs can at least claim a role in fueling the logistical chaos that quickly engulfed the Russians, leaving troops stranded on the front lines without food, fuel and ammunition within days of the invasion.

&gt;Alexander Kamyshin, head of Ukrainian railways, expressed Ukraine’s gratitude to the Belarusian saboteurs. “They are brave and honest people who have helped us,” he said.

&gt;The attacks were simple but effective, targeting the signal control cabinets essential to the functioning of the railways, members of the activist network said. For days on end, the movement of trains was paralyzed, forcing the Russians to attempt to resupply their troops by road and contributing to the snarl-up that stalled the infamous 40-mile military convoy north of Kyiv.

&gt;How much of the chaos can be attributed to the sabotage and how much to poor logistical planning by the Russians is hard to tell, especially as there is no independent media reporting from Belarus, said Emily Ferris, a research fellow at the London-based Royal United Services Institute. But without automated signaling, trains were forced to slow to a crawl and the number of them traveling on the tracks at any one time would have been severely restricted, she said.

&gt;“Given the Russian reliance on trains, I’m sure it contributed to some of the problems they had in the north. It would have slowed down their ability to move,” she said. “They couldn’t push further into Ukrainian territory and snarled their supply lines because they had to rely on trucks.”

&gt;The attacks also bought time for Ukrainian troops to formulate an effective response to the Russian invasion, said Yury Ravavoi, a Belarusian activist and trade unionist who escaped to Poland under threat of arrest during the anti-government protests that rocked Belarus in 2020.

&gt;“I can’t say we were the most important factor, but we were an important brick in the wall,” he said.

&gt;The saboteurs drew inspiration from an earlier episode in Belarusian history, during World War II, when Belarusians opposed to the Nazi occupation blew up railway lines and train stations to disrupt German supply lines. The Rail War, as it is known, is venerated as a moment of triumph for Belarus, taught in schools as the most successful of the tactics deployed by resistance fighters that eased the way for Soviet troops to drive the Germans out.

&gt; Eight decades later, it is Russia’s presence in Belarus that has stirred dissent. The deployment of tens of thousands of Russian troops in Belarus in preparation for the invasion of Ukraine triggered widespread domestic opposition and rekindled opposition networks formed during the 2020 protests against Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, said Hanna Liubakova, a Belarusian journalist living in exile in Lithuania.

&gt;This second Rail War has taken a more benign form than its predecessor. The partisans were keen not to inflict casualties, Ravavoi said. So they focused their attacks on damaging equipment to stop the railways from functioning.

&gt;“We didn’t want to kill any Russian army or Belarusian train drivers. We used a peaceful way to stop them,” he said.

&gt;He and other Belarusians involved in organizing the attacks decline to reveal precise details of how the attacks were carried out and by whom, citing the need for secrecy and concerns for the safety of the railway partisans, as the saboteurs are loosely known.

&gt;Three main groups have been involved, representing railway workers, security force defectors and cyber specialists, said Lt. Col Alexander Azarov, a former security official living in Warsaw who heads the security force group called Bypol.

&gt;Railway employees sympathetic to the partisans have leaked details of Russian movements and the locations of key railway infrastructure to a group called the Community of Railway Workers, which shares them on Telegram channels. Supporters on the ground link up to carry out the attacks, but there is no formal chain of command, Azarov said.

&gt;“Our movement is not centralized,” he said. “It’s not like there’s a leader of the resistance. It’s horizontal, with dozens of groups working on the ground.”

&gt;The third group, the Cyber Partisans, is formed of exiled Belarusian IT professionals who have carried out several cyberattacks on the Belarusian government since joining in 2020.

&gt;The Cyber Partisans launched the first attack, hacking into the railway’s computer network in the days leading up to the invasion and snarling rail traffic before Russian troops had even crossed the border. Infiltrating the railway network’s computers was relatively easy, said Yuliana Shemetovets, a spokesperson for the group who is based in New York, because the railway company is still using Windows XP, an outdated version of the software that contains many vulnerabilities.

&gt;Starting on Feb. 26, two days after the invasion began, a succession of five sabotage attacks against signaling cabinets brought train traffic to an almost complete halt, said Sergey Voitekhovich, a former railway employee now based in Poland who is a leader in the Community of Railway Workers.

&gt;By Feb. 28, satellite photographs began to appear of the 40-mile convoy of Russian trucks and tanks ostensibly headed from Belarus toward Kyiv. Within a week, the convoy had completely stalled as vehicles ran out of fuel or broke down.

&gt;The Belarusian authorities have since launched an intense effort to prevent attacks and hunt down the saboteurs. The Interior Ministry has decreed that damaging railway infrastructure is an act of terrorism, a crime that carries a 20-year prison term.

&gt;Dozens of railway workers have been randomly detained and their phones searched for evidence that they were in touch with the partisans, the activists say. At least 11 Belarusians are in custody, accused of participating in the attacks, according to human rights groups.

&gt;In early April, security police captured three alleged saboteurs near the town of Bobruisk and shot them in the knees. State television broadcast footage of the bleeding men, their knees bandaged, and claimed they had been shot while resisting arrest.

&gt;The shootings have had a chilling effect on the saboteur network, Azarov said. Belarusian troops are patrolling and drones have been deployed to monitor the railway lines. “It has become too dangerous to do attacks,” he said.

&gt;But by the time of the police shooting, Russia’s withdrawal from the area around Kyiv was in full swing and the Kremlin had announced it would refocus its military effort on capturing the east of Ukraine. The majority of the Russian troops that entered Ukraine from Belarus are now in the process of being redeployed to the east, the Pentagon says.

&gt;“We believe the fact that the Russians gave up on taking Kyiv is a result of our work because the Russians didn’t feel as safe in Belarus as they had expected,” said Franak Viacorka, spokesman for Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya. “Thousands of Russian troops didn’t receive food, they didn’t receive fuel, and they didn’t receive equipment on time.”

&gt;Now, a new phase in the rail war may be underway. In recent days the railway activists have posted on Telegram photographs of damage to signaling cabinets along Russian railway lines being used to transport troops into eastern Ukraine. The attacks can’t be independently confirmed, but Voitekhovich claimed members of his railway network are involved. “There are open borders between Belarus and Russia,” he said.",42b7ac4234fe99596589fa6839ae4efac555ea5f,True,False,,,,,0,1650987789,,0,{},i6a1p2k,False,t3_ucawm5,False,True,t3_ucawm5,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ucawm5/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_26_2022/i6a1p2k/,1650987800,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650958989.0

The arrogance of Putin was incredible, as Ukrainians had faced regular Russian army units for years and often captured spetsnaz or other operatives and were well aware Girkin manufactured the conflict from the start after invading sloviansyk, Putin would be there talking to Oliver stone saying “it’s Kyivs fault they won’t sign Minsk”

A war he purely orchestrated for the exact reasons you explained.

And on top of the heinous crimes and the war crimes of the proxies and the Russian army, Putin was demanding that they must all be given amnesty and basically as you explained setting up a situation where the war criminals and former prisoners and thugs who kidnapped and pillaged their areas would be given veto power.


I think Putin was really stupid, no government could ever accept that.

I saw his Twitter rtimelinr be was repeating the Kremlin bot lines of “But Minsk!!! Kyiv could have had peace!!”

And also before e invasion he acted incredulous saying “ can anyone show me proof of the troops ‘amassing’ on the border?”

And after the invasion he actually criticised Ukraine saying indignantly “ they damned Crimea!!”

The above is an account of a BTR's 30 mm 2A72 cannon collected by @BattlesandBeers
it recounts the challenge posed by these weapons in combat - the same account remarks that they prefer to engage Russian tanks than their BTRs. So, let's look into this weapon:

The 2A72 is a lighter version of the 2A42 that arms the BMP-2, it is mounted in the BPPU-1 turret for the BTR-80 series vehicles and in a few other applications. It is stabilised and dual-feed, meaning the gunner can switch between high explosive and armour piercing ammo.
Sam Cranny-Evans
@Sam_Cranny
·
5h
It can be elevated to +70 degrees, which is particularly useful in urban environments where targets are likely above the vehicle. It can engage armoured targets at 1.5 km and soft at 2 km, with a slant range of 4km. It has a rate of fire of 330 rounds per minute.
Sam Cranny-Evans
@Sam_Cranny
·
5h
It can fire single shots, bursts or rapid fire and the turret can be traversed slowly or quickly, the former conferring greater accuracy. The AP rounds can penetrate 25 mm of armour, might not sound like a lot but this is problematic for most vehicles at short ranges.
Sam Cranny-Evans
@Sam_Cranny
·
5h
The HE rounds are loaded with a projectile carrying 48.5 g of A-IX-2 explosive incendiary mix (RDX and aluminium), which means they will explode and create intense heat upon detonation. The fuze is a point detonating design with a 0.15 ms delay.

The efficacy of this weapon is wrapped up in a few things: The rate of fire is suppressive, and it does not have to be super accurate to pin an infantry section down.

The USSR was churning out 1300+ T-34s *a month* by 1943, and thus any tank losses have to be put into perspective against the tank production numbers. Current Russia is relying on a legacy inventory of thousands of tanks left over from the Soviet period, which have been (mostly) incrementally upgraded. There are vanishingly small numbers of new chassis being built - just see the complete absence of any T-14s for proof.

My opinion:

This is a great paper that explains much of the military balance and nuclear deterrent of today's world, and especially in regards to Russia. It explains a lot by using a clear thesis, plain language, and several examples. If you want to understand the conventional and nuclear deterrent thinking of Russia then I highly recommend it. 

I often think of nuclear deterrence and conventional deterrence as separate issues. But this article shows that they are inseparably linked and interact in ways that explain much of Russian nuclear and conventional posturing. 

The Russian desire to rely on nuclear weapons as a deterrent in a fight against a medium power in a regional conflict is something that is highly relevant right now. As Russia is currently struggling to get something it can call victory over Ukraine. 

It has come up several times now that the First Gulf War really had a deep impact on the perceived military balance for China and Russia. While often the time period after the Cold War is seen as remarkably peaceful and the zenith of Pax Americana, this is not the way this time period was seen in Beijing or Moscow. Their rapid build up of military forces in this period can be explained in part to the fear of conventional military capabilities of the United States. This is strikingly different to era of peace that it is often described as.

[],False,,bleepblopbloopy,,,[],,,,text,t2_4lu6l,False,False,"Quotes from the article: 

&gt; * While a stronger conventional power may find conventional deterrence sufficient,32 deterring conventional aggression with nuclear weapons remains a pressing concern for conventionally inferior states.33

&gt; * The US strategy called ‘flexible response’ is often cited as the first example of a nuclear policy designed to capitalise on the deterrent power of limited nuclear use in the face of conventional inferiority. It proposed a limited nuclear response to Soviet conventional aggression in order to offset US/NATO conventional inferiority.35

&gt; * Pakistan’s ‘asymmetric escalation’ strategy is a prominent example of this today threatening rapid nuclear retaliation in response to any Indian conventional attack.40

&gt; * To examine these dynamics that the conventional inferiority thesis leaves unexplored, I offer the Conventional Balance of Forces thesis of nuclear strategy, positing that conventional capabilities provide an alternative, more flexible or more credible tool for escalation management. It questions the claim that the deterrent value of nuclear weapons cannot be substituted by conventional arms.46 Conventional inferiority may produce nuclear compensation, but this is not a static choice. Changes in conventional threats and capabilities can produce change in nuclear strategy, reducing reliance on limited nuclear options. Some states may seek to reduce their reliance on nuclear responses, precisely because of a concern with the possibility of controlling escalation.

&gt; * If such a thesis were true, we would expect to see: (i) Perceived conventional inferiority correlating with enhanced nuclear threats and focus on limited nuclear options, and (ii) Conventional improvements correlating with reduced nuclear threats and a reduced focus on limited nuclear options. Several examples suggest that this may ring true. NATOs flexible response strategy re-emphasised conventional options by the late 1960s, in part due to concerns about escalation control.47 China continues to reject limited nuclear options for handling conventional threats, relying instead on improving other military capabilities.48 Pakistan remains an outlier, living comfortably with nuclear compensation. But Russian nuclear strategy suggests a reduced reliance on nuclear options as conventional capabilities have improved.49 Below, I examine this case in detail, exploring the impact of conventional inferiority and conventional modernisation on Russian nuclear strategy since 2000.

&gt; * Soviet strategists were among the first to identify the revolutionary effect of conventional precision strike capabilities on modern warfare.52 The first Gulf War demonstrated how ‘smart’ conventional weapons could carry out missions that previously called for nuclear forces.53 This led the Russian General Staff to model scenarios displaying the country’s vulnerability to large-scale conventional strikes. In one scenario, an adversary carried out conventional strategic strikes against Russia’s strategic forces in the Far East and destroyed 25% of the force in three days.54 The increasingly unfavourable correlation of conventional forces resulted in Russia dropping Soviet declaratory strategy of no first use of nuclear weapons.55

&gt; * Russian conventional military capabilities in the late 1990s reflected a limited ability to respond to advanced conventional threats. Two military campaigns in Chechnya revealed significant shortcomings in Russian capabilities for waging modern war.

&gt; * Russia’s ability to defend against advanced conventional military technology was severely limited. Russian early warning capabilities were geared toward detecting a massive ballistic missile attack: it was never set up to detect individual missile launches, let alone cruise missiles.

&gt; * Regional wars, the conflict category between these two, would involve two or more states, and could involve conventional or nuclear weapons.71 The Soviets had wanted to develop an ability to sustain such a conflict for an extended period without employing nuclear weapons.72 By the 1990s, Russian theorists had started debating whether Russia would have to choose between defeat and all-out nuclear war in regional conflicts because of the degraded state of Russian conventional forces.73

&gt; * Although Russia’s reaction to the US withdrawal from the Anti–Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty in 2002 had been muted, its concerns about a European missile defence system were growing.94 Western interlocutors played down this Russian concern, as missile defence capabilities in Europe could not defend against Russian ICBMs. But the Russian deterrence concepts as conceived in 2000 made limited nuclear strikes relevant for deterring or managing a NATO conventional strike, and missile defence could potentially degrade such options.95 The combined threat of Western precision-guided munitions and an enhanced missile defence capability that could mop up any scattered nuclear retaliation caused concern in Russia.96

&gt; * Some of Russia s leading theorists argued that in modern (sixth-generation) warfare, conventional weapons could replace nuclear weapons, given the higher credibility of their use.100 Victory would pivot on the destruction of the enemy’s economic infrastructure, and operational and strategic objectives could be met by massive precision bombings, rendering nuclear weapons obsolete.101

&gt; * Improved economic prospects combined with poor military performance in the 2008 Georgia war produced a decisive push to modernise Russia’s armed forces.103 By 2010, a comprehensive overhaul was taking shape, restructuring the entire military organisation.104 Russia launched a State Armaments Program for spending an unprecedented 20 trillion RUR on upgrading up to 70% of the military inventory.105 This included procurement plans for advanced conventional precision-strike capabilities, which were only slowly improving by 2010. 

&gt; * Russian strategists still seek a range of capabilities for escalation management because of a sustained perception of conventional inferiority, even if that inferiority is reduced compared to previously. The number of available conventional strike assets is likely one factor influencing this; the deteriorating political relations with the West another. Russian strategists now deem a potential conflict with NATO more, not less likely. Russian official strategy now states that the time, place, and capability chosen for Russian nuclear escalation of conflict should be unpredictable.144 A suite of non-strategic nuclear options ensure such flexibility.

&gt; * In Russian strategy, conventional capabilities do not supplant nuclear capabilities or vice versa: rather one augments the utility of the other. 

&gt; * Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu stated, ‘The role of nuclear weapons in deterring a potential aggressor will diminish, primarily thanks to the development of precision weapons’.155

&gt; * …the Conventional Balance of Forces thesis demonstrates that Russian sub-strategic nuclear weapons compensated for conventional inferiority, some 20 years ago. This strategy was a product of a lack of a conventional response option to a strategic conundrum identified by Russian strategists. It was not the product of increasing Russian foreign policy ambitions, but rather a response to a perceived growing threat. It was also a response conceived within a specific context: a regional conflict with a large-scale conventional air strike that could threaten Russian retaliatory nuclear capability.

&gt; * To nuclear strategists, understanding when and under what circumstances an adversary would resort to nuclear weapons has always been a central challenge. When a nuclear weapons state reaches that point depends on the balance of nuclear forces, as well as on conventional threats and response options. This article demonstrates how studying the conventional balance of forces produces insights into nuclear strategy deliberations and outcomes. The interrelationship between conventional forces and nuclear strategy is not static but dynamic. Conventional inferiority can produce increased reliance on nuclear threats, but some states seek to improve conventional capabilities to overcome this dependency. Russia is one such state: its preferred escalation management option is not, by default, nuclear weapons.",0ab354849701065d3be933efb4af4112f8d38c7e,True,False,,,,,0,1650982570,,0,{},i69oecb,True,t3_ucdjyr,False,True,t3_ucdjyr,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ucdjyr/russian_nuclear_strategy_and_conventional/i69oecb/,1650982584,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650953770.0

Missiles having huge ranges is not that prohibitevly expensive, but you run on other problems. Fielding a comical ammount of missiles would also require lots of crew, wich is expensive, this is why when you look up those system you see many missiles but much fewer launchers.

Killchain and ISR are also extremely important. Ships move on the sea, they're not as fast as airplanes but that movement presents an enormous problem against missiles with long ranges, having every missile be datalinked so you can update it with the targets coordinates as they make evasive maneuvers will make them very expensive very fast.

Search radar on missiles are small because of cost, so they need to get pretty close to target to track it. Fitting each missile with huge radars so they can look for targets over a wide area is very expensive.

IIRC the main thing leading to maritime strike tomahawk being dropped was the massive range it had didn't really matter because you didn't have sensors with enough range to maintain lock until it hit.

Tactically, Russia probably still has troops to attempt pushing for at most a few more weeks, will probably need to bring in more troops from outside (which is looking increasingly harder without mobilization or forcibly conscripting civilians in occupied zones, neither of which is ideal) beyond that.  Whether they achieve major,  minor, or no gains in the remainder of the Donbas doesn't change that it'll likely be their last push before significant manpower infusions.

Politically, Russia seems in the short term willing to expend most of the soldiers and gear they have committed to Ukraine, but they might not be able to afford to be so generous if they mobilize and use conscripts to form a second wave.


Tactically, Ukraine has manpower to spare, but their most well-trained and equipped troops have been on the front lines for 61 days now, and that's not good for the knees.  As time progresses more and more of their troops may have to be replaced with greener units, however, since they're mostly on the defensive, they're probably able to fuel a meaningful defense for months.

Russia clearly would like to secure **all** of Ukraine's coast.  The region west of the Dneister is probably relatively lightly defended and it's unclear the anti-ship defenses in Odessa can rotate over and repel a naval landing, especially now that the bridge is gone.

Russia can land now (with the landing ships that have been loitering around Crimea) and try to hold that region hostage (or just append it to Transnistria so that it has coastal access) to reduce Ukraine's coastline even further (admittedly that region is low priority, but as I said there are still reasons to take it)

Wouldn't blowing up the bridge mean the landing army would then be unable to threaten Odessa?  In the short term.

However, the Kherson forces from the East are nowhere close to Odessa, so not being able to threaten Odessa in the short term because of the blown up bridge doesn't have a negative effect in the long term.

Personally I think an invasion of the baltics, immediately leads to counteroffensive efforts designed to push the Russians out, possibly take Kaliningrad from them, but *stop* at the border to mainland Russia. 

Without themselves risking suicide, I can't see a gamble with nuclear escalation by Russia, unless NATO forces enter Ukraine, Belarus, Russia proper, or declare war with the aims to remove Putin/ establish democratic rule in Russia. 

Appeasement efforts as a response to Russian Baltic aggression leads to the collapse of NATO credibility and effective cohesion. 

Besides it would escalate anyways, even if they would attempt some meaningless appeasement routes, Poland probably goes in regardless of NATO. Possibly the Czechs and others too, because they *know* that they are next on the dinner menu if you never call Russia's bluff. 

At that point you have effective total war regardless, and it would be rational to push the Russians back from as far an eastern outset as possible.

&gt;The United States respects the right of nations to make sovereign decisions in the best interests of their people. The two sides engaged in substantial discussion around the recently signed security agreement between Solomon Islands and the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Solomon Islands representatives indicated that the agreement had solely domestic applications, but the U.S. delegation noted there are potential regional security implications of the accord, including for the United States and its allies and partners. The U.S. delegation outlined clear areas of concern with respect to the purpose, scope, and transparency of the agreement.

So, they let them choose their own alliance.

I will be generalizing beyond the intended scope of the work cited, but there are few experiments that invole starting wars as an experimental intervention, so this might be conjecture. However, there is a lot of evidence that suggests that there is a tendency towards risk aversion in the domain of gains (e.g. quitting while you're ahead in a casino) and a contrasting tendency towards risk seeking in the domain of losses (e.g. trying to ""make your money back"" when you just blew 10 grand at the roulette table).

Three circumstances seem to lead to the motivational necessity of this behavior:

* an individual state of loss
* a prevention-focused regulatory state (a state in which losses, or negative shifts from the status quo ante, are felt more strongly than gains)
* the risky option alone offers the possibility of eliminating loss

Now, if you're the authoritarian leader of a country that has passed its peak, you might find yourself in a similar situation, but with much higher stakes. If you can't keep your populus or at least your goons happy, you might suffer an acute case of defenestration. So, a high-risk-high-reward-scenario such as a war might begin to seem pretty tempting.

I think that's why democracy and (accurate) information can play such a big role in making the world safer: I would assume that these factors can level out the psychological or motivational problems of individuals to some degree, making aggressive actions less likely. No system is perfect, so that might not work perfectly, but I think this might be a contributing factor to the overall greater danger posed by authoritarian regimes.",f13e19b1860c74731b8a9cc5e032771097874a34,True,False,,,,,0,1650971306,,0,{},i691tg2,False,t3_ubpxth,False,True,t1_i66l81v,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ubpxth/operation_z_the_death_throes_of_an_imperial/i691tg2/,1650971317,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650942506.0

[],False,,TheCryptorZ,,,[],,,,text,t2_jiwoo,False,False,"&gt;It’s not overestimating. When you operate on an organizational scale there is a lot of redundancies and operational things that have to be carried out before you publish stuff like this. Intelligence orgs are great at giving a macro scale of information but for specific items of discussion more nuance will be found in individual intelligence collectors.

If you listen to Ukrainians that talk to officials from the west. They say that they lack huge amount of information what is happening on the ground. As I said outdated information that is passed from Intelligence agencies to diplomats, politicians, generals and so forth. They are not saying anything because they have  very little information. You can only get so much data from satellites. And even that data has to be analyzed which means it will be outdated.

&gt;For example the macro scale of the Russian build up and overall operation was correctly assessed by western intelligence. However the estimation of russias remaining cruise missile stockpile is an estimate with a large degree of uncertainty. But there are definitely individual intelligence collectors who can give a much more accurate estimate. Their info needs to vetted by the organization before they choose to accept the presented data which is what can cause these day-day gaps in info that is presented.  


I predicted in September that invasion will happen mid February. It was VERY obvious. You didn't need Intelligence agency to know that. And I didn't go to sleep on 24th February because again all sign were there that invasion was imminent. The day to day gaps happen because they have no clue what is happening on the front line. They just pass public information as their own. 

&gt;Also intelligence organizations will not publish their data or assessments promptly for public knowledge. This is to avoid exposing their intelligence collectors and to stop counter intelligence agencies from discerning the techniques that they are using to collect said info. If the information is considered crucially important it will get disseminated immediately through protected channels to those that need the information but information that is provided to the public maybe limited because it is a security risk.

This is just blatantly false. We are not talking about agents inside Russian forces or something like that. We are talking about information that is happening on the ground that you can see from Ukrainian side. You don't need covert agents for that. Their is nothing to expose if they publish the data. They just don't have the data.  



&gt;An example of this is that it is very clear that ukranians are using western intelligence to plan their ops (eg. The sinking of the Muskova) but they’re not publishing this information. The damage to the muskova was made public knowledge by Ukrainian DoD.  
  
You can also look at the amount of AWACS flights and UAV surveillance flights the USA has been flying close to the Ukrainian border and over the Black Sea. None of the info from them is getting published but the information is almost certainly being passed to the ukranians in real time.  
  
By not publishing real time data western intelligence also gives itself plausible deniability against accusations that it’s directly working with Ukraine, which Russia has accused it of doing many times.

This is pure speculation. Ukrainians could have done this op totally without western intelligence. Their is no sign that western intelligence was used. We know that western intelligence doesn't give RAW data to Ukrainians. Information that they get is old and not even raw.

We already work for Ukrainians. There is no plausible deniability left.",c997db4afdd695722ce7f667f3c1ebc5dd611023,True,False,,,,,0,1650955143,,0,{},i68i3py,False,t3_ubjh5n,False,True,t1_i6728ov,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ubjh5n/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_25_2022/i68i3py/,1650955158,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650926343.0

Good to see you move away from your initial statement that ""States involved in existential conflicts that take place within their borders very rarely emerge as strong and reliable partners."" to a more nuanced view and a case by case examination.

Every case is different, and indeed Germany and Japan had a different, in many ways more difficult case than Ukraine. The countries were smashed to a **much** larger degree, had to deal with enemy occupation on their lands, had little to no democratic traditions or institutions and lost territories, which creates grudges. 

&gt;South Korea is actually an interesting point. South Korea post-war was a dictatorship for roughly two decades post-war

Sure, but then, truth full democracy isn't really a requirement for a ""strong and reliable partners"" which is the point of contention. The cases we're already debating are and example for that as you point out yourself. We could add Turkey and Taiwan to that list. Perhaps eventually even Vietnam but that's such a weird case...

I don't disagree that democratic rights and freedoms get influenced by war, but I think Afghanistan and Iraq have shown us what being overzealous on pushing democracy too early gets you. 

&gt;The nature of conflict is such that it tends to arise in areas with precisely those characteristics. I would argue that Ukraine is less united than one might get a picture of from Western media. The war may actually erase those divides (as often is the case) but it is a system with a lot of corruption, factionalism, wealth inequality, and is no stranger to political violence. These are not the ingredients for a good recipe.

Oh I fully agree, Ukraine has a lot of history of corruption, political violence and it's not going to go away in a day, but as your own examples show, it doesn't necessarily going to preclude them from being a strong and reliable US ally and improve with time. They were on a trajectory of improvement before the war, they have a good chance to continue down that path once it's over.

I am not. I am simply stating that NATO can respond conventionally if Russia escalates by using nukes. The counter-point I am hearing is that Russia could use a NATO conventional response to escalate to a full-blown nuclear war. And to that, I respond that Russia if wanted to, they could use literally any excuse such as sanctions or no excuse at all to start a nuclear war - that is just the reality we live in. The point I'm making is that a conventional NATO response is less escalatory than a standard nuke-for-nuke tit-for-tat response. A conventional response could be as benign as supplying Ukraine with intel on targets in Russian territory or as serious as sinking the Russian fleet and applying a blockade.

&gt;NATO exists to defend NATO; it may have an interest in what happens in Ukraine, but nothing that happens in Ukraine has any bearing on whether NATO's promise to defend its member countries is credible.

I disagree vehemently. NATO exists to defend NATO on paper. However, article 5 has never been invoked against a nuclear state. It is entirely possible that some states could ignore an article 5 invokation in the interest of avoiding a nuclear war. The world is watching how NATO responds to Russian invasion.

Also the demand for oil and gas is largely inelastic. If Germany did destroy its economy for you (and put Europe in a major recession in 2023), then that gas and oil would be sold to others. China and India for example. Sure Russia would have to discount their rate, so instead of $1bn a day, they'll get $900m a day. That won't stop the war. A weakened Germany and Europe in a recession certainly will be seen as weakness by the Russians and would only encourage the war.

These little factoids don't cover what happens when gas and oil are shut down to one of the world's largest manufacturers.  Many German factories would shutdown immediately costing the economy and jobs. Telling Germans to turn down their thermostat when they just lost their job is especially cruel of you.

Also the demand for oil and gas is largely inelastic. If Germany did destroy its economy for you (and put Europe in a major recession in 2023), then that gas and oil would be sold to others. China and India for example. Sure Russia would have to discount their rate, so instead of $1bn a day, they'll get $900m a day. That won't stop the war. A weakened Germany and Europe in a recession certainly will be seen as weakness by the Russians and would only encourage the war.

[],False,,evo_help93,,,[],,,,text,t2_iul8dbh4,False,False,"Allow me to be clear: conflict tends to produce pressures that warp democracies and often produces poor political outcomes in post-war environments. France is a  great example of this exact process. Post-occupation French governance was *poor* to say the least: conducting a (shockingly brutal) war in French Indochina and Algeria alongside extreme domestic political unrest (almost culminating [in a coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algiers_putsch_of_1961)). 

And in a sense, yes the French government was reorganized multiple times post-war. I don't know how you could argue that the Fourth Republic was an example of successful governance given it barely survived more than a decade and required a significant reformation after its collapse (21 administrations in 12 years does not make a ""strong"" government). Whether this hits the threshold of ""rebuilt from scratch"" (whether in 1946 or in 1958) is up for debate, but these reforms are extraordinary and continue to shape French politics to this day. I suspect you know very little about French politics if you're using this as an example of a positive outcome.

&gt;There is exactly 0% chance Zelensky emerges as anything less than an enthusiastic ally to the US and the west. It’s bizarre that you’re suggesting otherwise.

I did not comment on Zelensky or his administration's enthusiasm for the West. My original point was that nascent democracies find war's extraordinarily difficult and damaging, and their political institutions often struggle in a post-war climate. Zelensky's administration will be no different. I am not suggesting he's going to suddenly pivot and become some bogeyman, but if you read my post my point is simply that Zelensky will face *numerous* struggles during the post-war phase, particularly as the conflict drags on longer. This highlights the need for a strong and coherent rebuilding plan and *commitment* to this plan by Western powers - something I am not sure we will be able to do. Even with that commitment, the domestic political configuration of Ukraine (high corruption, factionalism, proliferation of weapons, normalization of political violence, etc.) makes this job extremely difficult.",09a7f9cde9b5470e9b60dd66c598df55f2ee0b9e,True,False,,,,,0,1650932547,,0,{},i67apyb,False,t3_ubjh5n,False,False,t1_i678yt3,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ubjh5n/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_25_2022/i67apyb/,1650932564,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650903747.0
