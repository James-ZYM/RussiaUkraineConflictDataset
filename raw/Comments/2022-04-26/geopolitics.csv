An ACC is more easily defendable when it's near a coast, with land AA to support it.  Even aircraft carrier groups run out of Ammo.  And if the ACC gets damaged, it can become a sitting duck very easily. 

&gt;No, that's not the case. I suggest you do some research into availability, maintenance periods, ROCH etc.

According to the US navy they can deploy 8/11 or more at a time.  If necessary all 11 could be deployed, on relatively short notice.  

&gt;The same is true for a land-based airfield.

Yes, but you can build 10,000 land based airfields for the price of a carrier.  And if they blow it up, you just smooth out the holes, and it's usable again(unlike an ACC which sinks). 

&gt;Which is why they're currently used as a CIWS. An aircraft carrier has a layered defence whenever deployed operationally, and is actually better defended than a land-based airfield.

Yes, I'm aware of laser defense.  I was literally the one who brought them up...  they are expensive, and not that useful compared to their cost right now, or else they would be widely adopted, ESPECIALLY in having portable drone defense.  They are starting to become useful, but obviously if we had focused on them more, earlier, they would be better now.

&gt;No, they're not. Neither of them are invulnerable but neither are they useless.

They're not useless.  They're useless in a war with someone who's able to destroy them.  I'd argue they're worse than useless... they are actively detrimental to the war effort, as so many resources were spent on them that could have been spent elsewhere, and so many supporting resources are needed to use them.

&gt;The USA can deploy more.  The reason they don't isn't a lack of ability.  It's a lack of desire to put their whole indefensible fleet out at once, because they could literally lose half their navy if WW3 broke out, and Russia/China targeted them with hypersonic/nuclear missiles.

&gt;Yes, this is assuming you have the tank at a port.  What about the actual places we use tanks... often in landlocked countries.  Give me the figure for how much it costs to airlift a tank.

You don't airlift it unless it's a massive emergency, you can tow them behind semis with trailers or rail them. Rail is preferred, since it is very cheap.

Also, the cost of not having a tank when you need it is much higher than shipping it. 

&gt;Also, what is the shipping cost on ships, if you factor in the amount of money it costs to defend those supply ships, and factor in when they get sunk in an actual war without people who can fight back.


Not really relevant unless it's a peer conflict, in which case not much more than protecting the landing ships it's going with anyway. SAMs have dozens of miles of range.

But you really don't. Unless you want to completely retool every 10 years (which is massively expensive) you don't gain enough vs continuous improvement of the line. Every long running line tries to be more efficient, new cutting tools, new robots, different part programs, new fixtures ect. If you still plan on using them you might as well let them run and retool for the next generation since often your marginal increase over a few years isn't worth the captial expenditure. 

One of the lines I work on, it took us 3 years to recover the initial captial investment in the line and begin to actually make a profit. Maybe you could make a FMS line that makes tanks, but that'd be an absolutely massive investment. 

Not to mention you can just sell them later. The US isn't the only country that uses the M1, Egypt, Kuwait, SA, Poland, Australia all are users of it.",263d3e5f679b8eb827bb41b8519994a5777a5ee6,True,False,,,,,0,1651003826,,0,{},i6b7bzo,False,t3_ub4l19,False,True,t1_i6b29me,/r/geopolitics/comments/ub4l19/seeking_advise_on_a_good_composite_index_that/i6b7bzo/,1651003838,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1650975026.0

Yes, this is assuming you have the tank at a port.  What about the actual places we use tanks... often in landlocked countries.  Give me the figure for how much it costs to airlift a tank.

Also, what is the shipping cost on ships, if you factor in the amount of money it costs to defend those supply ships, and factor in when they get sunk in an actual war without people who can fight back.  And if you're not fighting someone who is capable of sinking your ships... why would you ever need so many tanks in the first place?

&gt;I'd argue it's more efficient to at least wind down some of those operations, in favor of long term research, at least in times of peace.
&gt;

These assembly lines can take years to spin up, wars can form in weeks. 


&gt;Like from 1990-2010, there was little threat of war for the USA. Imagine if it had been investing more in longer term research all that time, instead of making tanks and letting them rust so that they could keep their supply chain open to make tanks at high volume, at a moment's notice.
&gt;

The best way to improve something is by doing it, and those lines are better today than in `91 because they have been under continuous improvement. There isn't an assembly line it the world with that level of flexibility. I don't think you grasp the scale of this.

&gt;You can just make a batch of tanks once every 10 years. And sure, if you go to a war where you need TONS of tanks(more than we already have)... you won't be able to make more for a bit. But what possible scenario is there that you would ever need that many tanks?
&gt;

Do you have any idea how much a ""batch"" run of tanks would cost? It'd be billions, probably much more than what's being paid now. The Lima Ohio plant is massive, the machines are massive, the individual components are massive. I don't think you understand just how large these lines are. You need massive amounts of assembly space because tanks are big, you need massive cranes, you need a massive line to make numbers that matter. It doesn't make sense to shutdown these lines for 10 years and set them back up again. It'd take over a year to get everything set back up, PPAP all the supplies, PPAP your own process, find people to run it, find replacement parts, troubleshoot all of the issues. After listing those I'd honestly think I'd be closer to 2, after delays and sourcing is factored in. There is a reason almost every mass production line has a minimum contract length of 5 years. 
If you stop making them you might as well not start again. 

2nd point, idk. I'm not a politician, I'm a manufacturing engineer and former tanker. That's why my argument is about the line and tanks themselves, not the employment.

&gt;Things like drones are certainly worth keeping in production, because of how easy they are to selll, and how efficient they are to use. Tanks outside of South/North America are a pain in the butt to ship/transport... to the point that we don't even bring home most of the tanks we use overseas, and just blow them up, because shipping them back is so expensive.

&gt;All of these weapons manufacturers making record profits can take a little hit. What your argument amounts to is ""If we didn't constantly buy weapons, the Owners of these massive companies wouldn't be able to have gold plated toilets, and would have to downgrade to silver plated"". 

Stop missing the point. The point isn't to make them money, the point is to keep the line functional. It's not a political argument.



&gt;Do these companies want the security of lavish government contracts to keep them EXTREMELY profitable at all times? Sure. And they lobby for it. And they get them. But the idea that they need to maintain those massive profits constantly is off a bit IMO.

In essence, imagine it’s the 1700s, and the British made a metric based on the number of soldiers they can neatly line up who shoot on command (and the enemy meets you at agreed locations + follows the same rules….). 

Well, they did do that pretty much. Not only vastly underestimating US potential, assuming the US would follow the same ‘tactics’,  had less capable soldiers &amp; weaponry, and outside parties (France) would aid the war &amp; eventually participate. 
* A quick example showing how false those assumptions are : Morgan’s Riflemen, who used guerilla tactics, had better marksmanship &amp; weaponry (long rifle), and would ‘unimaginably’ resort to ‘uncivilized’ tactics like focusing fire on officers to disrupt chain of command leaving British infantry clueless &amp; useless.

This article hits several aspects of the proverbial nail that is India's geopolitical interests straight on the head.

- it doesn't delve into India's already evolved positions on indigenizing its military industry instead of switching from one set of imports (Russia) to another (the West).   
- it doesn't speak about Indias shift in the Ukraine conflict from 2014 (when it supported Russia) to today (when it is calling for both sides to de-escalate)  
- My opinion: I personally don't think India is interested in ""winning over"" Russia in a conflict with China. I think the reasons are a little more nuanced than that.

""Admonished"" as in the judge telling the prosecution to ""just be mindful"" because of how right wing circles are reacting. That does not at all disprove any of the allegations against Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann for lying to the FBI planting a clearly false story of Alfa-Bank having contacts with the Trump Organization. It's quite funny you bring that up considering the entire Russiagate"" Trump collusion"" story was literally political. It was the Hilary campaign law firm Perkins Coie that retained Fusion GPS who came up with the fallacious Steele dossier that claimed the Russians have ""kompromat"" (ex. golden showers) on Trump and that Trump was working with the Russians at the highest levels based on unverified anonymous sources thoroughly debunked by all mainstream media outlets after they promoted the living hell out of it with major editorials pulling their past articles on the matter. Ironically it was the Clinton campaign with their ""pied piper"" strategy elevating more far right candidates including Trump who they explicitly mention in the Podesta emails from WikiLeaks. The allegation that owners of Alfa Bank were ""informal advisors"" to Putin and even as far as bribing Putin with cash when he was mayor of St. Petersburg was determined to be ""demonstrably false"" by a British court ordering Steele pay compensation for basically lying. The Alfa-Bank ""pinging"" story with the Russian bank's servers having back door communication with the Trump Organization was borne from Clinton's Perkins Coie lawyer Michael Sussmann who approached the FBI with the allegation while making a false statement that he wasn't representing a specific client even though he was billing his time to the Clinton campaign. Imagine if Trump's lawyer did this, would you call it political? And before Sussman approached the FBI, he briefed Christopher Steele &amp; Fusion GPS executive Peter Fritsch on the ""pinging"" allegations prompting Steele to make up his Alfa-Bank executives story as well as Fritsch &amp; his fellow executive Glenn Simpson to go out on a frenzy begging various media outlets to plant the ""pinging"" story. Based on what evidence? Anonymous hearsay. So people associated with the Clinton campaign brought the issue to government authorities and then planted it in the Steele dossier as well as the mainstream media all in the midst of the election season. But yet, that's not political? And that's not all. Turns out, Fritsch, Simpson, and Steele went out to make a killing on the story during Trump's presidency by making a non-profit collecting dark money amounting to $7 million in funds with half of it paid in ""research fees"" to an entity affiliated with Fusion GPS and $250,000 to Steele. But somehow John Durham is being ""political"" for prosecuting Sussmann for lying.

So now the story has been changed from Trump having ""intercepted calls"" with multiple ""senior Russian intelligence officials"" to now one person - Konstantin Kilimnik, a former aide to Trump's one-time campaign manager Paul Manafort. From who? FBI? CIA? NSA? Nope. The Senate Intelligence Committee in 2020 &amp; the Treasury department in 2021. So the Special Counsel headed by former FBI director Robert Mueller couldn't find this secret Russian agent for two years not to mention the FBI's Crossfire Hurricane counterintelligence investigation from the year prior, but somehow the Senate Committee &amp; Treasury department did? ""Confirmed"" is a very strong word. The FBI even [admitted (page 8 under ""Arguments"")](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5001611-Memorandum-in-Support-of-Motion-for-Hearing-04.html) to Manafort's attorneys that there was no communications that they found between Manafort and Russian intelligence officials.

The problem isn't abrupt nuclear annihilation.

The problem is that Russia has most of its power due to its nuclear stockpile.  In terms of conventional military forces, economic power, or alliances, Russia is pretty barren.

So, if Russia wants to expand its influence, power, etc, its only true option is to use nuclear weapons, or at least threaten to use them(with believability).  The first nuclear engage by Russia would likely be a small ""tactical"" ""low yield"" nuke.  It would be smaller than some conventional bombs.  

This obviously would not result in an immediate nuclear response by NATO, or any nation.  No nation automatically fires nukes if Russia uses a tactical nuke in a war, 50km across their own border, into disputed territory.  They know this is a possibility, and have known it for years now(even before 2014), whether in Ukraine or elsewhere.

When Russia uses a tactical nuke, it will obviously cause pause from the west.  Add China and Taiwan into the mix, and the whole situation becomes very murky.  But it certainly doesn't automatically evolve to nuclear annihilation.  We'd likely see a period of tactical nukes in geopolitically ""murky"" places like Ukraine.    Just like how there is an unwritten rule to not escalate beyond proxy war between the USA and Russia... there will be a new unwritten rule... don't use tactical nukes on cities, or on geopolitically sensitive targets(like inside of Russia or Nato).  

Russia is simply too incentivized to use nukes.  And if it continues to fail in its conventional warfare, nukes become all the more appealing to Putin.  And Tucker Carlson will be saying ""I don't get the big deal... this tactical nuclear bomb was smaller than other conventional bombs... America is making a big deal out of nothing"".",556826066ae54e9c0677f531bf08a0ccf9508edc,True,False,,,,,0,1650941241,,0,{},i67usz2,False,t3_ubuwi0,False,True,t3_ubuwi0,/r/geopolitics/comments/ubuwi0/why_the_war_in_ukraine_wont_go_nuclear/i67usz2/,1650941256,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1650912441.0

My point, to the article, is simply that we can't actually draw from such incidents that the nuclear risk is low because leaders are risk-averse. We know quite a bit about the earlier crisis -- the Cuban missile crisis in particular, since the tapes of the ExComm are literally public record now -- so we can see that leaders' initial reactions **weren't** risk-averse. If I try to apply these lessons to the present they don't seem particularly reassuring, since it would imply that:

1.) The initial responses by senior politicians are likely to be dangerously pro-war, and they are likely to make better decisions only if they have the time to deliberate, which is a scarcer commodity now than it was in 1962 or 1950.

2.) Senior politicians are likely considering actions that they think are safe but in retrospect are not, because of imperfect information.

The Kennedys didn't make it but people like McNamara have been pretty clear they think were lucky to make it through those early crises without nuclear war.",a8672b1d4c67d1d0ca3078cf54f5ab8dbc97c9b7,True,False,,,,,0,1650936206,,0,{},i67j6ly,False,t3_ubuwi0,False,True,t1_i67hcqi,/r/geopolitics/comments/ubuwi0/why_the_war_in_ukraine_wont_go_nuclear/i67j6ly/,1650936224,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1650907406.0
