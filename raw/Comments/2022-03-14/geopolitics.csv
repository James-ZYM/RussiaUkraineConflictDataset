Map of combat operations for the evening of March 14

The loudest event today was the tragedy in Donetsk, which overwhelmed other reports from the front. The Ukrainian Armed Forces have been striking areas of Donetsk without any military infrastructure for a day now. Today a Tochka-U missile was shot down by the Air Defense Forces right above the center of Donetsk, killing about 20 civilians, including children. In response, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced that the Ukrainian military-industrial complex enterprises that produce the weapons used by the nationalists would be put out of action. The Ministry warned the citizens of Ukraine working at these enterprises, as well as residents of nearby residential buildings, to leave the potentially dangerous areas.

In the Nikolayev region, there is no change today. The Russian army is fortifying in this area and shelling enemy positions.

On the eastern front, there is widespread advance and intense fighting. Between Vasilievka and Zaporizhzhya there is shelling of AFU fortifications. Fighting continues in Gulyaypol. Information is contradictory, some say that we occupied the city, others say that no one entered the city. Ugledar was flanked and blocked, advancing northwards. On the Donetsk line, fighting intensified, our forces are trying to go on the offensive near Avdeevka. To the north, the LNR army presses the AFU in Severodonetsk and Rubizhne. Near Izyum, the Russian Armed Forces are advancing in the southern direction, advanced units are already 15 km from Slavyansk, the AFU retreating blew up another bridge near Bogorodichnoye.

There is fierce urban fighting in Mariupol. Today, the legendary militia commander of the DNR - Clooney died. It is reported about the arrival of reinforcements - 5,000 soldiers of the Rosgvardia.

In Kharkiv, heavy explosions and artillery fire can be heard in the area of Northern Saltovka, Dergachi and Malaya Rogany, where there were reports of fighting. Apparently the goal is to cut off the communication between Kharkiv and Chuguyev.

In Kiev, the disposition on the fronts was the same. High-precision strikes were reported against infrastructure facilities, in particular, a large stockpile of ammunition for MLRSs was destroyed near the Antonov plant. In addition, a missile strike was launched against the Impulse plant in the Sumy Region and the TV tower in Rivne was knocked out.

-Russian forces conducted several limited attacks northwest of Kyiv on March 14, unsuccessfully attempting to bridge the Irpin River.

-Russian forces did not conduct offensive operations east of Kyiv and continued to prioritize improving logistics and reinforcing combat units.

-The continued ability of Ukrainian forces to carry out successful local counterattacks around Kharkiv indicates that Russian forces are unlikely to successfully bypass Kharkiv from the southeast to advance toward Dnipro and Zaporizhia in the near term.

-Russian and proxy forces continue to achieve slow but steady territorial gains in Donetsk Oblast after initial failures in the first week of the Russian invasion.
Ukrainian forces halted resumed Russian attacks from Kherson toward Mykolayiv and Kryvyi Rih on March 14.

-Russia will likely deploy small units of Syrian fighters to Ukraine within the week and is confirmed to have deployed private military company (PMC) forces.

-Russian and Belarusian forces increased their activity near the Ukrainian border in the last 24 hours in a likely effort to pin down Ukrainian forces but likely do not have the capability to open a new axis of advance into western Ukraine.

-Russia and China deny that Russia seeks military aid from China and claimed that Russia does not need additional military support to complete its objectives in Ukraine.

China is an ascendant power relative to the global average, and also relative to Taiwan (Taiwan is richer per person now, but the gap is getting smaller over time). This favours attacking later rather than now. Russia is a declining power, so it made more sense for them to attack now rather than later.

Taiwan is not recognised as a state in the UN.

Taiwan is only over direct security relevance to the US, not to Europe.

Russian officials initially want to use rubles to pay the debt but have decided to use Yuan instead.  They are using it to pay $117 million on two dollar-denominated bonds  They are doing this because their Euro and US$ holdings have been frozen.  This is a temporary measure.  

While people say this is the beginning of the end of the dollar reserve currency, it is premature.  There are many petrodollar enthusiasts here.

The share of the Yuan of global transactions is 2.6%, the highest since 2015. However, again this is most likely due to the pandemic. Once its subsidies. it will most likely track downward unless there is a change in policy

[],False,,ElGosso,,,[],,,,text,t2_2yk37djy,False,True,"The framing of this article is funny to me - I understand the Korean War was really the first open conflict between the two blocs but using it as an analogy to describe the Russo-Ukrainian War is almost hilariously vindicating to all the realists like Mearsheimer who point to NATO's missteps as the root cause of the situation.

After WWII, the US occupied half of the country and decided its democratic government (the People's Republic of Korea) wasn't west-aligned enough, so the military governor ruled the interim Korean government was illegal, and its leader, Lyuh Woon-hyung, was assassinated by a fascist gang called the Baeguisa that was funded by the US Counterintelligence Corps. Then MacArthur flew in Syngman Rhee, who had been in America courting American politicians as part of the provisional government-in-exile; Rhee ""won"" the election just like the Soviet-favored Kim Il-Sung ""won"" in the North and ruled South Korea with an iron fist until he was overthrown by a popular revolt in 1962. Between Rhee's establishment and the Korean War there were three rebellions in four years that were violently suppressed by the Rhee regime and the US military to the tune of over a hundred thousand dead South Koreans. Yet here today, this article calls the North's assault ""dictators on the march"" against the South, like they weren't marching against another dictator.

The Korean War was never about protecting freedom-loving South Koreans from dirty authoritarians, it was about maintaining a strategic foothold on the doorstep of the Communists to be a constant threat; let us not forget that North Korea shares a border with Russia. When the article admits that ""history rhymes,"" it does so more than it lets on - NATO didn't have to court Ukraine to antagonize Russia, just like the US didn't have to overthrow the popularly elected democratic government or help murder 1/3 of Jeju Island who decided they didn't want to be trampled by Rhee's jackboots. At this point we must admit that containment is a strategy that inevitably leads to conflict, whether in Korea or Vietnam or Ukraine, and choosing it for Russia in the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse was a massively aggressive (and aggressively massive) mistake.

Anyway, despite that rather jingoist omission, I think that this article's recommendations are, at best, wrong, and at worst, psychotically warmongering, as one would expect from a pair of authors who work for a think tank that was one of the primary architects of the Dubya Administration's Foreign Policy - the American Enterprise Institute. The article says the US ought to focus on Eastern Europe and east Asia at the expense of Central Asia and Africa - what it is calling for here is more containment, not less, and anyone watching Reddit's front page get filled with corpses of Ukrainian babushkas and all of the other heart-wrenching suffering can see what that will bring. Meanwhile, it seemingly forgets that other countries have their own interests aside from being best buds with America.

Everyone and their mother knows about China's investments in Africa via the Belt and Road Initiative, but many often forget about France's many and myriad economic interests in its former colonies - there is an absolute truckload of money flowing from the Françafrique into France. And with Merkel gone, players in the EU are jockeying for position among its leadership. Should Macron et al emerge victorious, France could prove to be a valuable ally to whoever should court them, but without an expression of soft power, that might not be the US - it might be China, developing African economic ability for both its and France's benefit. Money talks and horsepocky walks, and the Marshall Plan was a long time ago; this article's advice might put us at the precipice of a China-aligned EU, destroying every dream of the second ""Pax Americana"" that this very article invokes.

I would like to apologize, to the readers and moderators, for the somewhat acerbic tone of this rebuttal - believe me, it underwent several revisions, and this is the best it received. I will not, however, apologize to the authors of this article, who seem to be less interested in giving good advice than in pumping money into weapons contractors by creating more crises for the US to throw Javelin missiles into, for the digs made in it.

Xiomara Castro is the first Honduran president not to be a member of either the Liberal Party or the National Party since democracy was restored in 1982. She is Manuel Zelaya's wife, the guy that was deposed with US's tacit consent back in 2009. The US has really had to flex its diplomatic muscles in Honduras in order to tame many of Castro's campaign pledges - https://theglobalamericans.org/2022/02/xiomara-castro-unlikely-u-s-partner/

We also have Nayib Bukele in El Salvador who has progressively split from the US - https://www.americasquarterly.org/article/from-bad-to-worse-nayib-bukeles-split-with-washington/

And then, of course, you have Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua a country that along with Cuba and Venezuela represent the triad of evil communism in Latin America. 

A left tide in Central America was unthinkable up till a decade ago but even more unthinkable was perhaps the left winning in Chile with Gabriel Boric - https://www.latimes.com/podcasts/story/2022-01-06/the-times-podcast-gabriel-boric-chile-constitution

Add to that Pedro Castillo winning in Peru, Luis Arce in Bolivia (a successor to Evo Morales that overturned the coupsters in that country and sent Jeanine Añez to jail) and Alberto Fernandez in Argentina. 

We have to follow closely the presidential elections in Colombia that will be held in about a month, but it's important to notice that the leftist Pacto Historico won the most seats in the Senate and the Congress in yesterday's election, again something never seen in the history of the country. The traditional right-wing parties are terrified right now of the possibility that Gustavo Petro becomes the first independent left-wing president in the country's history. Finally, we have to follow what is going on with Brazil who has stepped aside from the US-UE sanctions against Russia.

The consequences of this tilt are not hypothetical, you just have to see what is happening between the relationship between the US and Venezuela, and the latter's shift from pariah to hopeful contender of the democratic world: We'll likely see and easing sanctions in the coming days as a way to ease the current situation with the oil market. Before that, the policy of isolation against Venezuela had been slowly dwindling in the past two years: Europe stopped recognizing Guaido as president early last year and Grupo de Lima died after most countries stopped caring and left: Mexico, Argentina, Peru, Boliva, St. Vicent and St. Lucia

A motion for stopping the recognition of Maduro as official representative of the Venezuelan government was voted in UNGA in December, 2021, only 16 countries voted against him: The US, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Georgia, Guatemala, Honduras, the Marshall Islands, Israel, Paraguay, the United Kingdom and South Korea (some time after the vote held place Xiomara Castro got into office and Bukele recently stated that ""Washington says when the bad ones are good"" with regards to the meeting between Washington and Venezuelan officials in Caracas, which has been seen as slap on the faces of some of the most hard-line antagonists of Maduro in the region).

Another interesting development was the creation in 2010 of Comunidad de Estados Latinoamericanos y Caribeños (CELAC), an organization that groups 33 Latin American countries and excludes the US and Canada, and which is expected to substitute OAS *de facto*. OAS is another regional organization but based in Washington DC, and it's *vox populi* that is entirely in the hands of US's political influence.

https://mondediplo.com/2020/05/13oas

Bolsonaro's right-wing government broke away from CELAC and Colombia boycotted CEL's Mexico Summit in 2021 as a protest against Maduro, but we might be seeing a greater impulse to this organization later this year as the shift to the left consolidates in those two countries. It is very interesting to note that China and CELAC created the China-CELAC forum as a formal mechanism for China to interact with Latin America. Guess when it was created? January, 2015.* 

https://bricspolicycenter.org/en/china-celac-forum/

I wonder, how can a Return of Pax Americana would be even possible when the US is seemingly losing control of its entire backyard, with an absolutely self-centered and schizophrenic foreign policy that goes back and forth from one presidential period to another and even within one same period to accommodate itself to geopolitical urgencies?

* *Let us remember that 2015 is the same year that China created the CISP banking messaging system and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB); the same year they decided to admit India and Pakistan as full members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in Ufa, Russia; some months after China and Russia signed a yuan-ruble swap line worth 150 billion yuan to avoid and counter American sanctions.

For one, yes the USA will be able to make more money selling F35s and other equipment to Europe. The USA will also garner more military support for a potential clash with China. A stronger European military will mean the USA is able to divert more resources towards countering China. Possibly without having to increase expenditures at all as the USA can simply shift resources from Europe towards China. This won’t happen for several years as right now more USA military presence is needed in Europe now than was before the war in Ukraine. Gas prices have been skyrocketing in the USA long before this war and the USA only gets 6% of its oil from Russia. The United States stands to lose through a declining European economy that will have less purchasing power. The West has proven to be extremely adaptable and innovative for hundreds of years however. This reality has just been shown by the pandemic and the innovation spurred by the challenge. If not for atrocious right wing anti masking policies.....I’ll digress however look at death counts in highly dense Japan who masked early. 

Many times there are no winners in war. Certainly the globe’s economy will take a hit initially as is ALWAYS the case with war. Trade embargoes and sanctions are bad for Russia, but they’re also bad for everyone to a smaller degree. 

In short, it was obvious to me that this war made no sense for anyone. Anyone not named Vladimir Putin. And unfortunately, in a dictatorship only one person’s thoughts matter. Putin wants the USSR back out of stubborn grudge and he’s willing to kill en masse to get it back. He considers the breakup of the USSR a major blow to Russia’s autonomy and pride and sees it as an embarrassment that needs to be reversed.  

Putin kills brutally in Syria every single day. He drops cluster bombs there on a daily basis. The sole purpose of his killing there is to form a friendship with Assad so that he can stage air power in Syria in an effort to project power in the Middle East. The sole purpose of this power projection is to cause headache and financial cost to the West.",31740c06df7cce53d508fb3a34c35020c7c21d3a,True,False,,,,,0,1647284742,,0,{},i0ni7vd,False,t3_tdvqy4,False,True,t1_i0m1ap3,/r/geopolitics/comments/tdvqy4/a_new_world_energy_order_is_emerging_from_putins/i0ni7vd/,1647284759,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647255942.0

Pax Americana never went away. The US is by far the dominant global power, always has been since the Cold War, and will continue to be for at least the next century.  It has the only military force that can project power globally, it controls all of the world's oceans, its economy is the world's largest, and its culture seeps into almost every fabric of society everywhere on the globe.

Russia? It's economy is only about as large as Texas, a single state in the US. It's military is so weak that it's having a hard time fighting a much smaller next-door neighbor. After over two weeks it hasn't even gotten into the center of Kiev, let alone taken control of it. Many of its tanks have run out of fuel and are sitting ducks for enemy missiles. Russia is so desperate that it has to ask Syrian fighters to come over for assistance. 

China? It's a Third World country where over a billion people live on just a few dollars a day. It has no allies, and no modern military experience. Despite over a decade of threats, it hasn't launched an invasion of a tiny island country close by, because it knows it would lose. All it can do is launch temper tantrums whenever the US or other other countries sail their warships through the Taiwan Strait.

The heart of the question is based on the idea that NATO/US doesn’t want to risk nuclear war, and a direct military confrontation against Russia would risk a nuclear escalation. So the primary question is do you think the US would actually defend NATO members (Baltics, Poland…) if it meant World War III?  Many will argue (and I agree with them) that the main reason Putin risked invading Ukraine is precisely because they were not a NATO member, and that Putin would not dare touch NATO territory. If this is true, then NATO is at no risk of nuclear escalation or war with Russia in the future as long as it doesn’t get directly involved in Ukraine. Meanwhile, others will argue that Putin's invasion of Ukraine was the first of many to test the West. If the west didn’t respond, then Putin would be more willing to call bluff on NATO Article V by invading the Baltics. If Putin believes the US is dead set on not risking nuclear war, then his inclination to invade the Baltics might be exercised. I personally believe that the US is taking the stance it is on Ukraine because it believes Putin will not risk touching NATO.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other government leaders have remained in the capital. The Battle of Kyiv is the only battle that matters in the Ukraine War.  
In this episode of MWI’s Urban Warfare Project Podcast, John Spencer offers his assessment of what the Battle of Kyiv will look like. He breaks down the key steps Russia, or any other military force, would have to take to achieve the goal in this city attack and the tactics and approaches Ukrainian defenders are likely to adopt to stop the attackers from succeeding. He also provides important historical context—how past large-scale combat operations in cities might help predict the future of the Battle of Kyiv.",4b9af781c8b27a76275f5e3dfd023d10cb21b62b,True,False,,,,,0,1647263199,,0,{},i0m266l,True,t3_tdx2vg,False,True,t3_tdx2vg,/r/geopolitics/comments/tdx2vg/podcast_what_will_the_battle_of_kyiv_look_like/i0m266l/,1647263215,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647234399.0

Thank you!

You said: “Clearly there is a double standard and the main reason for the hate campaign against Russia is not really humanitarian, it’s because ….”

Western media calls what is happening in Ukraine “Putin’s War” and they are careful not to blame Russian people that have nothing to do with the invasion _even_ if they support their leadership due to being misinformed by dictatorship controlled media. Yes every country has racist idiots that spread hate and these get extra attention but they get it because they are extreme not because they are representative.

To better understand why the double standard exists (and I do not disagree there is a double standard) please see my attempt to explain it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/tc5d65/exodus_of_iconic_american_companies_takes_psychic/i0cchs8/ (Long thread feel free to contribute!)

IMPORTANT: If some member of your family did something terrible, say they kidnapped and killed my child, does that make it reasonable for me to do that to your child? Obviously not. Both actions are wrong. You can not justify one bad action with another. Instead dialog must focus to repair damage / justice / etc and to stop any current bad actions and to stop further bad actions. 

Do we agree on this important point?

You said: “I haven’t seen much footage, I’m sure there is devastation and civilians have died and that’s very sad, however the Ukrainian army decided to bring the war to the towns using civilians as a shield, instead of fighting far away.”

So far ~ two million (!!) women and children have fled their homes in Ukraine to avoid the death and destruction in Ukraine’s towns and cities. Ukraine men stay behind to defend their homes. They fight in cities and towns. That is where they live. Should they line up in a field exposed to Russian tanks and machine guns instead? 

Modern wars are almost all brutal urban warfare. Both sides take heavy losses. Even after you destroy them, cities are notoriously hard to attack.  No doubt you have heard of “Battle of Stalingrad”. I read somewhere that Puntin lost his brother in that battle. Ironic that desperate urban warfare may now also cost Putin the leadership of Russia and even his life.

Ukraine is putting up a strong resistance. You can see what the battles look like by watching combat clips from: https://old.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/. Warning: Some video clips show burnt mangled body parts of soldiers incinerated inside their combat vehicles. 

Ukraine is armed with small light but deadly anti tank missiles (ATGMs) that are devastating to tanks and troop carriers and helicopters.  Estimates that I trust say that Russia has lost 10% of the initial invasion force in combat so far and that there is a need to send in more troops. RT may or may not tell you about the extra troops. The starting amount of 200k troops was not enough. 

So far thousands of young Russian soldiers will not be coming home to their families.  I believe RT is hiding real information about losses. I read that even calling the “special operation” by what it is: a _war_ can get you sent to jail for 15 years. 

I have no idea how the choice to invade a democratic country of 55 million people with an army of ~200k Russian troops can be hidden or justified by RT but I have no doubt they will try.

I summarized by current view on the war here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskARussian/comments/td28r7/thoughts_on_whataboutism/i0jl7nl/ My post there starts with a quote that matches what I think: 

“Russia can’t win this war. Russia can occupy Ukraine after much destruction and death of Russians and Ukrainians, but Russia won’t be able to hold it. Ukraine has 44 million people, and most Ukrainians will not accept a Russian puppet government. There will be an insurgency that will make Afghanistan and Iraq look like nothing, and Russia will have to maintain an occupation force of hundreds of thousands of soldiers. And Ukrainians will be bitter and hateful towards Russians for generations over this. Putin single-handedly destroyed the ancient brotherly relationship between Russians and Ukrainians.”

——-

You said: “Russian people living in the Donbass region have been killed for 8 years, this is ignored by western media but shown on RT. ”

Western media covers lots of stuff from around the world with recent focus on COVID and recovery from that. The Donbas region events do not get much coverage. I only learned about them when Putin started the invasion and war in Ukraine because I wanted to know the history.

My understanding is there is a part of Ukraine that has closer ties to Russia and this part wanted to leave Ukraine and join Russia and reaction of Ukraine leadership was to try to stop this. Russia sent troops and supplies to support the rebels and there has been a simmering conflict there ever since. 

No doubt RT gave Donbass lots of coverage because Russian leadership needed a pretext to invade Ukraine which Russian leadership considers not to be an independent democratic country but a break away region of Russia. 

Say the people in Russia from regions that border China decide they want their regions to leave Russia and be a part of China and China sends them arms and troops. Perhaps China is suspected to finance and start their rebellion in the first place. What would Russia do? Say Russia resists the rebellion and there is a simmering conflict. Does this give China the right to invade and start a war with all of Russia?  

I hope this shows the situation from a different angle than what RT uses.",92be1fee6b2461fb81728c4ee346a56acfcbf13f,True,False,,,,,0,1647259372,,0,{},i0lvmt7,False,t3_t884dq,False,True,t1_i0hp2ci,/r/geopolitics/comments/t884dq/scrambling_to_avert_russian_default_putin_allows/i0lvmt7/,1647259386,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1647230572.0

They've spent a lot on their blue water navy given Taiwan and a potential pacific ocean contest vs USA for example. And have competitive long range missiles they can utilise from their coast - there was that carrier killer long range missile that was getting hyped a while back for example.

In more recent years, I've heard the development of their combat drones are pretty competitive too.

In regards to actual recent conflicts, nothing major. That India vs China 'skirmish' was practically nothing for example. They've also started sending troops to protect their assets abroad in regions like Africa, which can be said to be a start of overseas expansion, but again the numbers are still small currently.

All in all, my guesses are they wouldn't be able to contribute that competitively to a land based conflict on the other side of the world outside selling/sending combat drones currently.

First, Japan was only *temporarily* poor, because of WW2 physical destruction, but even so it still had many infrastructure, industries, and especially, Human capital intact originated from decades of *already* being an industrial developed state. Japan did not became developed thanks to the US or post-ww2 stuff, right policy or not, that is a narrative suitable to washington, but Japan was industrizalized since the 1870s meiji era, and defeated an european industrial army in 1905 already. This situation can not be comparable to india in any way. Even korea had some industry built by japanese, and were intensely aided by washington in its policies. India was a resource and cheap unskilled labour extraction colony for england for 200 years, with almost no industry modern or even traditional (the english famously cut the fingers of weavers to destroy local production of textiles and to only import finished goods from english factories), with very few options for policy at all. 

Japan and Korea (which copied it) also did and do not follow a traditional west-european capitalism, they have an intense level of goverment control and regulation over private sector and economy, and prefered to foster national champions in private conglomerates capable of competing with external actors eventually (chaebols/keiretsus) , instead of markets (they of course exist, but the central actors shaping the structure are conglomerates). Also, they were and are very protectionists in several ways, refusing to let foreign companies come into to compete with local companies BUT allowing its domestic companies to acces US and others markets AND reverse engineering all technology they could touch - like china does now (and the US *ONLY* tolerated this behaviour because of their political importance in contaning comunism and their *total* political subordination to US political and military interests - that last until today). 

India on the other hand in 1947 had just come out of several long-term traumas and  deprivations originating from english colonialism that could not have been dealt with in any significantly different way. Indian nationalism could not accept any similar level of subordination to US interests, indian traumas of english capitalism made it so that society was very sympathetic to the ideas of socialism (and india was not really socialist in the soviet way, because private property was never abolished), indian economic deprivation after the english colonialism and the turmoils of partition left her with very few industrial expertise and capital, it is improbable that Washington would help india the same way it did korea &amp; Japan (giving billions in investment, allowing mass reverse engineering and granting privileged access to US markets), rather the US quickly became a political adversary because of its support to pakistan (a national enemy of india) and China too, etc.
