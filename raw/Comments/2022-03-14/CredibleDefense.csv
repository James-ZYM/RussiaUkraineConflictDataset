[],False,,Kiltymchaggismuncher,,,[],,,,text,t2_5732rxf0,False,False,"I'm not sure the lack of belarusian support would have stopped the war, but it would have allowed Ukraine to focus on fewer fronts for sure. The warning signs for belarus being subsumed into russian thraldom were there almost immediately after the rigged election. Russia sending into officers to help keep the peace as they would call it. Once Russia gets a foothold, they never leave.

Belarus tried playing the middleman like a modern al-nasser, but the west's condemnation sent him firmly into putin's grasp, to save his own premiership.

The fact the eu had committed to essentially the same sanctions on belarus as with russia, shows they understand the new reality.
With military forces permanently within their borders, its unlikely lukashenko will ever criticise putin. Russia will happily replace him if he becomes non compliant, and its hard to tell whether belarusians would make too much noise. They fundamentally don't like their leader, and opinion polls generally show that they feel closer to Russia than the west. I think a lot of people like to assume the attempt to oust lukashenko, was also part of a shift away from Russia.

I think however that these moves by Russia are observed warily by the ex soviet states, even by those that are members of csto. China's treatment of Hong Kong only emboldened Taiwan to move further from china's sphere, and as country's like Kazakhstan observe the erosion of belarusian sovereignty, they will be trying to take steps to avoid a similar fate.
Almost none of them have given any level of support to this invasion, as they have very little desire to rock the boat either way. Depending on the outcome of the war, they may end up sliding further to China. Despite Russia and china's overtures of support for each other, its an accord of convenience, given both states are diplomatically fairly isolated from popular support. The two have been competing for power with the central Asian ex soviet states for years. With the loss of military hardware in this war, their may be long term difficulty in power projection for Russia, which China will likely capitalise on.

They face the save threat from turkey, who embarrass Russia anyway during the Armenian Azerbaijan war. Armenian was left feeling abandoned by what seemed like a weak russian response. Given turkeys often opposing goals in the caucuses and middle east, they may aim to gain as much from the near sidelines as possible. The fact they closed the bosphorus straits to the russian navy, and continue to supply tb2 drones to Ukraine shows a willingness to force the scale in their balance. As well as agreeing to set up production in Ukraine, there's also reports there are turkish operators directly involved in the operation of the drones striking russian positions, which is firmly on the other side of the red line, that Nato has tried to draw.

I think that while they may gain some extra strategic maneuverability in Eastern Europe, they are likely to lose ground in most other theatres, unless they calculate their losses and make some calculations as to what they can afford to compromise. They need a quick peace here. Both Ukraine and Russia are now making positive statements about being close to such a deal, so we will see what happens.

The bigger question on the long term consequences to europe of a belarus satellite, would likely depend on what the west would require to lift sanctions. Previously the eu stated they wouldn't recognise any russian gains from conflict, so if the peace is made with such gains awarded, russia may remain locked out. Without at least some sanctions being lifted, russia will struggle to both rebuild their losses, and actually implement fixes to deal with the poor logistics and operation of their forces.
Given the poor state of affairs in belarus own military, I don't think they will be of much benefit in that regard either.",ed3f5d5293774ed1a535d1587311e464027074e1,True,False,,,,,0,1647301527,,0,{},i0omatw,False,t3_te61i7,False,True,t3_te61i7,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/te61i7/becoming_a_military_district_deepening_military/i0omatw/,1647301545,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647272727.0

And when NATO start shooting down Russia jets and bombing SAM batteries, that’s a war. Both of those would occur. To attempt it otherwise is to be willing to lose cargo planes and pilots for no reason. They would not touch down, they would not get in. Anything inside would be destroyed. There are no ways to approach the city and supply it that would not be covered by Russian air defenses and CAPs in short order. 

The Berlin airlift was a show of resolve yes, but it was also a meaningful effort that supplied millions of tons of supplies to the city. That will not be possible here, even if every A400M (which again, please show me where the unmanned versions are) was used. There aren’t that many and they would be destroyed. They cannot survive contested air space.

The West/NATO has already shown plenty of resolve and willingness to arm and supply Ukraine, no one doubts that. So as a show of resolve, it’s pretty pointless. 

Allegedly, perhaps, there were some skirmishes in the air during the Airlift. They’ve never really be confirmed and the USAAF report about anti-air fire was found to be very exaggerated and full of fabricated or unproven stories. More importantly, there was no war. 

The Berlin airlift was an operation of unarmed planes bringing civilian supplies to a city that was not at war. None of the participants were at war. There was no real effort to stop the airlift by means of attacking it. That would not be the case here. They will, without a doubt, be attacked and they will, without a doubt, be shot down.

There isn't much point to fly weapons directly into Kyiv I would assume. I am focusing more on the propaganda / pressure angle here.

Don't forget that there is no war in Ukraine, only a ""special military operation"" to get rid of some Nazis. Ukraine is a big place, I am sure a couple of A400M won't be interfering with that operation at all.

I don't quite understand how you seem to think we need to supply Kyiv indefinitely. This can be a faint, it can be real, it can be done for another city. Nothing needs to be decided.

Ukrainian Soldiers have been rotated in and out of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions since 2014. This has seen a massive amount of practical experience given to a new generation of soldiers. It’s not just combat experience, you have logistical branches among others such as intelligence who have been consistently deployed on and off for years now. 

Couple this with the threat of their intelligence community being constantly under attack through cyber warfare. “NotPetya” among others raised alarm bells that constitute and existential threat to core infrastructure long before the main Russian offensive last month. I can only imagine they will have liaised with the wider western intelligence community to develop training and mitigation strategies that have only honed their experience.

This war seems far from over, however I believe that Ukraine has improved its combat and intelligence capability immensely and it shows.

That would not be the case here. The aircraft would be bringing in war supplies to the middle of a battle. There is no way to spin that as not having joined the war effort openly. Russian forces would fire on those aircraft, and if they were not protected they would be destroyed in short order. 

Not only that, but the Berlin airlift involved almost 700 aircraft flying into Berlin multiple times a day. At the height of the airlift, it was bringing in one plane every 30 seconds. That is not something that can be replicated by a handful of cargo planes.

You really don’t seem to grasp the difficulties of this type of operation. Put simply, any attempt organize an airlift that did not first deal with the threat of Russian forces would be an immediate failure.

I expect Ukraine is suffering significant losses. The question is: how much of these losses will be made up by new weapon deliveries. If Ukraine receives continuing amounts of anti-tank weapons and SAM, plus some heavier weapons such as rocket artillery and light APCs, then they might be able to mount an offensive.

To do this they would need to significantly neutralise Russian artillery as this appears to be Russia's most effective weapon in attack and defence. It would be hard to Ukraine to prevent Russia from detecting large troop concentrations, but if Russian artillery is neutralised (either destroyed or out of ammo) Russia might not be able to do much about it.

I can see Ukraine being able to encircle and destroy isolate Russian BTGs, but larger operations such as cutting off the kherson salient, are probably beyond it for now.

[],False,,Solubilityisfun,,,[],,,,text,t2_su9cy,False,False,"This is indeed an important question. We don't have a clear and concise answer, at least yet. I don't believe a singular reason can entirely explain this observation.

We know and can infer a few things anyway.

A fairly popular claim, at least a week ago, was that Russia is severely lacking in precision guided munitions. However, we know they were using them fairly regularly recently in Syria. That said, PGMs are expensive and cannot be manufactured on demand. They have lead times in production and their electronic components are impacted by sanctions. They are critical for near peer conflict as well. I'd posit that keeping their reserves available is a conservative play should escalation occur. Note that its unlikely any party outside of the United States actually has truly deep PGM reserves. It was noted during the Libyan intervention that PGM use rate couldn't be sustained past 3-4 months. Russia is unlikely to have greater stocks than even that.

We also can infer that expected resistance was lower and the operation was anticipated to progress faster in the opening stage. Russia pulled their veteran pilots and some key air assets from Syria back to Russia roughly a week into the conflict after these assumptions proved incorrect. Seems to be a misplay in hindsight.

We have observed communication and inter-asset coordination issues almost across the board. Its likely that Russian air assets do not operate in the same manner that western and especially US air assets do. While we are used to tight coordination between even squad level units and air support it appears this is just not something Russia really applies. They seem to use air power as an isolated tool for specific applications, a more operational rather than tactical strategy.

We do know they have sizeable air assets on paper. I don't believe its all a lie. That said, modern airframes and pilots are wildly expensive relative to anything else conventional. They are dependent on electronics that Russia can't entirely self procure. Replacement in the short to mid-term is in jeopardy with sanctions, and probably even without given Russia's middling economy even prior. Thus a lost aircraft and pilot is likely not replaceable in a timeline that matters. Yet aircraft are critical for a near peer situation and for efficient expression of power against much weaker parties like we saw with Syria. Minimizing losses of this side of their military is more important than any other.

Given they pulled many of their pilots operating from Syria, we can guess they don't have a deep pool of well trained or experienced pilots either. A modern pilot takes years to train. Unlike back in WW2, its not possible to just pull civilian pilots and bring them up to speed in a short timeline. They are likely just as precious at the moment as their modern air frames, although slightly more replaceable, they still can't be replaced within this conflict or an escalation.

Essentially, Russia uses air power a bit differently from western air powers. We don't know how much of this is training and communication vs doctrinal differences. Its definitely both in part. We know they don't have the resources to replace some assets, both due to sanctions and a middling baseline economy and because modern advanced equipment can't be rapidly replaced by anyone anywhere regardless. We know they poorly predicted the opening stages of the operation and did not have their key air assets in place and prepared (pulling from Syria) indicating they don't have deep reserves of pilots, optimally maintained modern aircraft, and or advanced munitions.

I'd bet their airforce as a whole can't deploy their full suite of aircraft due to lack of pilots and advanced munitions (probably maintenance as well although not likely not the limiting factor). They are being conservative with what they have in case of escalation. 

Even if they decided to drop the conservative stance I don't believe we would see them use air power in tight supporting roles. They don't communicate well enough and likely haven't trained to do so at any significant level. It would likely be simpler operations organized from the top.",afa99c01c93f5e3751d3196fae24c737b10f1ebd,True,False,,,,,0,1647298042,,0,{},i0oehvy,False,t3_te4kpe,False,True,t1_i0o7nsn,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/te4kpe/how_was_ukraine_able_to_conceal_its_true/i0oehvy/,1647298064,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647269242.0

1. Russian military isn't as powerful as it is on paper
2. Most of the mid-level and even senior level military commanders where caught off guard, and everything from logistics to even directions and tactics got fucked
3. Morale on the Russian side is super low, so soliders are performing worse than they would be with good morale.

So regardless. Now if Russia sends another wave of troops, it has to face off their own equipment that was previously captured, with people who already have knowledge of what they have, and all the super green Ukranians now have combat experience. In addition, more time for foreign fighters to enter ukraine, many of them the special forces types that will be training ukranians for combat.

The Russians also had their elite paratroopers jump in day one, and a lot of them got KiA, so a lot of their best of the best are already exhausted.

Now, there are numerous possibilities

1. Putin is getting old and starting to slip. Ruling via strength is always a game of thrones. He holds power via force and treachery. Of which require an army of powerful and treacherous people around him.
2. Sabotage from within. There is distrust of his highest intelligence people, many openly opposed the war. So he kept it secret even from them. The machine doesn't function effectively like this. They rebelled by leaking information. Some of this has been hinted at
3. Shit morale of Russian troops.
4. Sabotage from outside - Its all a big NATO plot. The idea would be to get Russia to invade, and then sabotage the invasion, leading them into pre-planned traps giving cover to utterly destroy the Russia economy, military, and diplomatic reputation, and seize hidden, but found overseas assets in one go. It'd also repair the US's and NATO's reputation, and convince previous NATO critical countries like Finland to join. Possible, but if this was true, it'd be probably the biggest, boldest, most ambitious operations in the history of intelligence work, and a master class in a well oiled efficient intelligence machine.  


Reality is that its probably a combination of all four to some degree combined with shit luck and shit morale.

[],False,,evo_help93,,,[],,,,text,t2_iul8dbh4,False,False,"Real life is not a game of Civ 5. There's no ""key vulnerabilities"" or ""quick tricks"" to end a war in progress, but let's game out this scenario of yours.

1. The US engages in clandestine support for what remains of Belarusian opposition after the brutal crackdown of 2020-2021. (Note that 32,000 persons were imprisoned). We are hoping none of this gets intercepted by the Belarusian / Russian authorities who no doubt have tabs on the surviving anti-regime agitators.
2. Protests somehow gather momentum in Minsk and throughout Belarus. The Belarusian security services resort to the same brutal crackdown we saw in 2020-2021 (murder, torture, sexual violence, imprisonment, etc.). It's worth noting that Belarus was capable of all this without Russian interference. Russian interference would require significant escalation of the protests (difficult to do after your protest movement was basically brutalized and dismantled just a year ago). 
3. NATO, under pressure from human rights groups, positions an expeditionary force on the border with Belarus to try to draw Russian troops away from Ukraine. Your assertion that ""this invasion will never happen anyway"" means that in order for Russia to take this threat seriously, it must *look* serious. In other words, if Russia knows no invasion of Belarus is going to take place by NATO (under the guise of some ""humanitarian"" intervention) then they will have no need to redeploy troops and thus your gambit doesn't work. 

So where does that put us? We have the Russians now convinced NATO may force regime change in Belarus (I'd be willing to bet this is a red line for Russia). The *likely* outcome here is that Belarus swiftly and decisively annihilates the protestors with their armed forces (largely intact, mobilized, and not deployed to Ukraine). Congratulations, you just got a ton of Belarusians killed and it didn't change a thing. 

Unlikely outcomes are that Russia deploys additional troops from other parts of Russia to Belarus and crushes the protestors themselves. Very unlikely but still possible outcomes are that the presence of a massive NATO force aimed directly at Belarus forces either an intended escalation (escalate to de-escalate) or an unintended escalation between perhaps Belarusian and NATO forces (war is highly chaotic after all). 

And let's not ignore **the biggest issue with this entire plan: a NATO expeditionary force with enough power to threaten Belarus will have to be stationed in Poland or Lithuania, right next to Ukraine / Russia.** It will be *impossible* for Moscow to determine whether or not that force is aimed at Belarus or at Ukraine / Russia. This is a *colossal* step up the escalation ladder to the point that you may as well threaten Moscow directly with troops in Latvia. 

I don't see how *any of this* helps. I honestly cannot stress to you how insanely risky this entire proposal is. To recap: you basically want to signal to Putin that you're going to threaten Belarus, Ukraine, or even Russia proper with NATO troops. Saying ""oh no don't worry, this isn't serious."" or ""hey no we're just after Belarus"" is not going to convince anyone. Utter madness. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This war only ends when Putin runs out of recourses, or annihilates Ukraine. He's not going to just back down, he:s refused every off-ramp offered. So we either help with drawing away and wasting his recourses, or just sit back and watch as he Grozny's everything from Kyiv to Liviv.

It's not clear that Russia even has the desire, let alone ability, to position large troops near Lviv to ""Grozny"" it. This war will end as the vast vast majority of all wars do: at the negotiating table. Putin has not been given *any* off-ramps so far, especially given that he and Zelensky are heavily constrained by domestic political considerations. 

The current trajectory of the war is each side will continue to batter at each other until a military breakdown *somewhere* forces the negotiating hands of one party (likely Ukraine's at this rate, but you never know). I expect this will happen in the coming weeks to months with periodic ceasefires being signed until Putin can walk away with enough of a ""win"" to justify the extreme costs he's had to pay for it all.  

How would I end the war? Unfortunately in the current status quo the war is not ""endable"" nor is NATO even trying to ""end"" the war (why would they want to?). Each side must now fight it out to push for better terms in the peace deal that has to come *eventually.*",2a1b81d9bfb855ad718dad32c27620d8d6dcff9d,True,False,,,,,0,1647296991,,0,{},i0oc1o1,False,t3_tdxg6p,False,True,t1_i0o8xsa,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tdxg6p/ukraine_megathread_march_14/i0oc1o1/,1647297007,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647268191.0

Re: economics, I could go on for days on China and why it's weaker than you might believe based off its numbers. Don't get me wrong, China is a strong regional power, but it's got insane demographic challenges, and unlike Japan and Europe which got rich before getting old, China didn't, even as it racked up debts.

And that's BEFORE going into other problems like how China cooks its books, is a totalitarian regime with iffy property rights and opaqueness.

So China has been uninvestable for a long time imho. A lot of foolish people got the ""bright"" idea of shipping tons of know-how and capital there out of greed and fantasies about how economic reform would lead to political reform and an eventual peaceful end of the Communist Party (as with Russia, the problem has more to do with the government, and not the people themselves).

So China will not invade Taiwan anytime soon.  Btw, it doesn't need to.  Instead, it can simply steal know-how legally or via espionage/covert ops.

The losses of Russia are very significant, but so are Ukraine's and Russia is just a lot more able to absorb their losses. If we have 8 more weeks like this, Ukraine won't have any machinery left but Russia still will. It will be hugely diminished, but that point Russia will probably have lost about about a quarter to half (super rosy scenario) of their tanks and armored transport. Half is still better than none. Ukraine's ability to wage certain types of warfare then are just going to be much more limited. 

Russia also seems to have become more cautious. Even with their losses they still have a lot of options. Will Russia just shell the crap out of everything over the course of a couple years and drive over the rubble with it's tanks? Will Russia try but something else happens, morale breaks/coup at home/insurgency tactics destroy supply chains or Russian economy falls apart? People are hoping for one of those and they all play off each other. The more the insurgency can hit supply lines, the worse morale gets, the more the army falls apart, the longer sanctions are in place, the more danger there is for a coup.

Me, and just about everyone else is hoping for that 2nd option. But if Russia just decides to hang back and destroy everything through artillery and can weather the sanctions with the help of China, or install enough puppet officials that the insurgency falls into a half resistance/ half civil war then Russia still comes out ahead sort of. Their reasoning was to create a buffer between NATO and Russia. If Ukraine is leveled or fighting against Russian elements within Ukraine, Russia still has achieved that goal. It's questionable if all the other costs are worth it, especially if the Baltic becomes a NATO sea.  

One reason people like to cheer the Ukrainians and that I have hope for them is that they're tough. They ran to the woods and fought Stalin for years, even when they couldn't seek safe haven in Poland and Romania, which they hypothetically could now if worst came to worst.

Like isolating Germany and exacerbating it's poor economic position?

&gt; Many people, even at the time, agreed with the British economist John Maynard Keynes that Germany could not possibly pay so much in reparations without severe risks to the entire European economy. In his later memoir, U.S. President Herbert Hoover went so far as to blame reparations for causing the Great Depression.

&gt; Meanwhile, Germany’s economic woes, exacerbated by the burden of reparations and general European inflation, destabilized the Weimar Republic, the government established at the end of the war. Due to lasting resentment of the Versailles Treaty, the National Socialist (Nazi) Party and other radical right-wing parties were able to gain support in the 1920s and early ‘30s by promising to overturn its harsh provisions and make Germany into a major European power once again.



I think counter-intuitively, the open hostility (and that's what these sanctions essentially are) may backfire. Yes, it will hurt Russia in the economic sense but it has just as much potential to unite their population against the world than create instability.

It's a lot easier to say ""hey, there's a big bad villain who is trying to destroy our way of life"" when the whole world *is* actually trying to bring you down

It'd worked for Iran, for NK, for Cuba, etc. And WW1 left Germany in shambles - yet they still managed to do a lot of damage just some short decades later.

Granted, I'm not trying to say that we shouldn't sanction Russia, but just food for thought. It's not always so easy to draw historical parallels. Like that famous quote.. history never repeats, it only rhymes.",9e75ecd4d9ea15a43aee60257b1249196d83382a,True,False,,,,,0,1647287869,,0,{},i0nq6km,False,t3_tdxg6p,False,True,t1_i0n74bh,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tdxg6p/ukraine_megathread_march_14/i0nq6km/,1647287881,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647259069.0

But one factor that I rarely see mentioned is the new political situation in Belarus that has made it much more reliant on Russia to maintain power. This changed Belarus' policy and not only allowed Russia to base troops on its territory, but even to launch an attack on its neighbor from its territory. This geographical advantage to reaching Kyiv faster may have (among many other things) tipped the balance to going ahead with a full invasion. 

The fallout of the 2020 protests and instability in Belarus may have had major implications to the war unfolding now.

The allies had not negotiated rail or road routes into and around east germany, but HAD for 3 distinct air corridors. Thus, the lift had a greenlight, as the soviets couldn't deny these without totally breaking even superficial negotiations.

[],False,,TheNthMan,,,[],,,,text,t2_f2tj4z6,False,False,"A big difference between a MiG and MANPADS is that you can toss the MANPADs and other munitions into civilian trucks, vans and the like and drive them across the border to Ukraine.  Russia does not easily know when they are going and can't just bomb all trucks and vans driving into Ukraine from Poland.

With a MiG, it is going to have to take off from a Polish military air base and fly into Ukrainian airspace.  If Ukraine, supplied with NATO intelligence are on top of it, they may be able to slip in between holes in Russia's SAMs and combat air patrols, but that is not a certain thing.  If they get caught and Russia attacks the plane, then if the plane is armed then it will probably try to defend itself.  If the fighters do protect themselves, then to Russia, that can be interpreted either as NATO sending NATO jets into Ukrainian airspace and attacking Russian military targets, or as Poland or NATO allowing Ukraine to base combat operations out of a Polish or NATO airbase.  If the fighters are sent over unarmed or do not protect themselves, then they are shot out of the air like a turkey shoot.  The fighter transfer is a futile effort, a waste of a pilot and hardware and still a propaganda win for Russia.

This is before considering the cost of transferring and backfilling 28 fighters, parts and munitions and re-training time for pilots and maintenance crews, or working out any basing concerns.  India was said to be closing a deal for 26 F/A 18s, 18 single seater and 8 two seaters at a cost of 4.6 billion USD.  Sure Poland currently operates F/A 18s and probably are not looking for two seaters, so the cost to backfill Poland would be different, but still it is in the billions of dollars.  That would consume more than half of all the funds that the US authorized to aide Ukraine's military.

[],False,,Zhuregin,,,[],,,,text,t2_jzs2u5qq,False,False,"The truth is we have no idea how much anyone is losing personnel wise. We know that Russia has lost around 1,200 vehicles since the start of the war, but only 552 were destroyed or damaged - the rest were captured or abandoned. That means mass desertion, right? In the US army, yes. In the Russian army, abandoning broken down vehicles instead of waiting for them to be fixed is SOP, and the breakdown rate is *horrendous.* Russian vehicles were always designed for a short shelf life on the idea that they wouldn't survive long in a war anyways, and after the fall of the Soviet Union the Russian defense industry hit rock bottom. MT-LB, the main armored vehicle built after 1991, had a *50%* breakdown rate en route to exercises. The Russian approach to deal with this since Soviet times has been to mass huge reserves of vehicles in depots and rush them to the front to replace broken down and lost vehicles, then let maintenance companies ""collect"" the refuse later and see what can still be fixed. Only, since 1991, the maintenance department of the Russian army has been severely lacking and it's unlikely any abandoned tanks/APCs will be put into action for weeks after a breakdown.

It should be no surprise that so many videos of Ukrainians capturing equipment involves that equipment being towed - much of it doesn't even start, and the vehicles that do start likely have other crippling deficiencies like a defective gun. As far as capturing combat-effective goes, it's often forgotten that Russia is the *advancing* party in this war, and it is *very* hard to capture equipment conducting a fighting withdrawal. Those operational vehicles that are captured have been captured in the limited Ukrainian counter-strikes during this war, none of which have considerably shifted the front line. In short, it's very safe to assume that the *vast* majority of Russian captured/abandoned equipment does not reflect on personnel numbers.

As for the 536 destroyed vehicles, a typical armored vehicle:personnel loss rate is 1:3 or 1:4. You're looking at around 2-3,000 losses.

Tooth to tail ratio for the Russians is unknown, but is certainly higher than for the British army. Russians have [very little logistical support](https://i.imgur.com/T3AUNRn.jpg) compared to NATO armies. They do have logistics units not attached to any combat formation, but these are likely outside of official troop count. Tooth to tail is likely around 1:1 or close to that, and many of the losses have been ""tail"" (half destroyed vehicles, for example, are soft top trucks). Overall I'd say a sober estimate of the rate of attrition the invasion force has suffered is 1-4%. It's easy to get optimistic, but this 21% figure is based on 3 assumptions, all of which are probably not true:

1. The 5,000-7,000 KIA figure is accurate
2. 5,000-7,000 KIA means triple the number of total casualties through POWs and wounded who can't be sent back to combat (most wounded are)
3.

And how inspite of this no western force can employ them extensively. Syrian forces who use motorcycles praise them speculating that in the future a motorcycle will be an essential piece of kit for an infantryman, equivalent to a rifle of camping kit in terms of sheer essentiallity.

I push back on the arguing that due to their incredible injury rate and risk of death motorcycles will continue to decline in western militaries in spite of their advantages.

HOWEVER, irregular forces, poorer forces, or forces who expect to lose air superiority, we should expect to massively increase the use of motorcycles sincew they're primary advantages of stealth, cheapness, and versatility, are an effective counter to a technologically superior enemy who owns the skies.

As such extensive use of motorcycles is a military technology, at once incredibly powerful, and almost completely outside the possibilities of a modern western force.

However, we've seen a significant amount of evidence regarding corruption and malpractice within the Russian military. We've been told from OSI with troops complaining on VK or tiktok that their equipment isn't being properly repaired. We've seen dozens of photos of Russian trucks and wheeled vehicles with rotted tires, or which have just outright broken down rather than being defeated in combat.

There may not be an answer to this question available to us now, but there is a real question as to how many of those tanks are actually operational, as opposed to operational on paper but in need of unreceived maintenance and repair.

I'm asking you if you have any information on the readiness of those vehicles that Russia says it has on paper.

And with seeing vehicles that were not combat ready sent into Ukraine, I'm not necessarily sure that even the Russians know the answer to that question.

I don't necessarily think the person you're arguing with is automatically correct, but I also don't know if your denunciation of his argument as flat out wrong is correct either.

I think we don't know. I think it's possible the Russians themselves don't know due to corruption.

And so I'm asking if we've got any reliable info, OSI or otherwise, into the readiness of the equipment in the real world that Russia says it has on paper.

It's okay if you don't know. Neither does the person you're arguing with.

They really want to be energy independent, as that removes any threat of US oil blockade, but if they get energy independent, they won't need Russia for anything.

To add insult to injury, China also tries hard to build arms export industry, directly competing with Russia in the mid-tier military sector. So far that's not going great, but China has been so successful at all other kinds of manufacturing, so the odds are, they'll do very well too, even if it takes a bit longer.

Michael Kofman and Rob Lee both mention that it is plausible that the Russians are 'defeated' - i.e. that they cannot justify the costs of the invasion, particularly if it continues without major successes - and that they believe a negotiated settlement is the likely result, with Russia not achieving many of the aims it invaded in pursuit of. They describe it as a 'War for Cities' - and Ukraine is currently holding the vast majority of them. As Kofman points out, Russia does not have the requisite number of troops in theatre to effectively take them either.

I agree that no credible analysts have said anything like the initial commentor suggested with Ukraine ""beating the crap out of Russia"" - but a Russian 'loss' is a completely different story.

There are a ton of strategic reasons why Russia would want Urakine. For example, Russia doesn't have a very large population relative to their   
""adversaries"", so their possible economic output (world power) is limited by the amount of people they have. Taking a large territory like Ukraine is a massive shot in the arm at possible economic output. It also removes a buffer to Europe, a massive economic zone, and instead puts Russia as a border to that economic zone. These are just two of I'm sure very many legitimate long-term strategic reasons why they believe this invasion is in their best interest to do.

Their limitation is that they're close to a totalitarian state, so they have one massive requirement for all of their goals: no change in current leadership structure. If this wasn't a limitation of theirs, you could see how they could simply act peacefully and magnanimously, create a ton of incentives as to why Ukraine could want to align economically with them, not have all of these downsides to it based on their leadership behavior, and just wait a bit. Give it some time, you could absolutely see a situation in which Ukraine and a number of other states would be interested in forming a larger economic bloc with Russia, and that would achieve the same goals. That's just impossible when part of doing that would be accepting Putin as your supreme leader. Therefore, invasion is the only way to achieve this with these requirements.

I'm not saying any of this is perfectly accurate, etc. I'm just saying think with your brain about the larger geopolitics here. This isn't based on ""well I'm listening to what one side says versus the other."" That's just filtering through opinions. Think about Russia's strategic goals, what's standing in their way, and what their options are for achieving those goals given the obstacles.

Russia's strategic goal is to become more powerful, and therefore more able to act how they want without having to listen to what someone else says they have to do. This is how the United States operates. We literally do whatever we feel is in our national interest at all times, because no one can tell us otherwise. Russia would like to be able to behave that way. So would China.

Doubt it. The potential downsides to this far outweigh the benefits. For one, Russia is in close proximity to Ukraine so they would likely get hit with fallout.

Third EU would almost definitely ban all Russian fossil fuel exports, and there's a chance Russia would lose its seat on the UNSC over something as brazen and batshit crazy as that.

[],False,,Ararafufufu,,,[],,,,text,t2_5dh6oyxx,False,False,"For the first week or so I also didn't believe that Ukraine could expel the Russians currently in the country, but i'm starting to have doubts.

There's been no serious Russian gains since they fully took Kherson. That battle ended 12 days ago. Yes, they are taking villages and seem to have encircled Mariupol. Yet, after nearly three weeks, there still isn't a lot of movement or a major breakthrough. This could all still happen (e.g. a full encirclement of the Ukrainian army in Donbass), but there is of yet no evidence Russia can make quick strategic gains.

They need gains to stop the overextension that is currently happening. With current manpower they simply can't push every front. An obvious example is that Kharkiv seems to have stopped being a major target, with many units in that area instead devoted to breaching Kyiv's eastern city limits.

If Russia doesn't establish a solid front, they won't be able to stop minor (or major) incursions happening. At this moment Ukraine is not fully capable of this, but they are currently mobilising and given weeks or months will vastly outnumber Russia's army. Yes, this advantage will likely be un-mechanised infantry, but the efficacy of MANPADs has, to a certain extent anyway, neutralised Russia's equipment advantage.

If Ukraine is given the time to fully mobilise, equip and train (to a certain level anyway) their population, I could very well see the frontline move back in the direction of Russia and Crimea. Russia simply won't be able to cope with divison-level movements of infantry. Gains will become smaller (basically the speed at which infantry can advance), but the frontline would move back, eventually expelling Russia from their current gains.

If Russia decides to mobilise then all bets are off of course, but at the moment that does not seem to be a route the Kremlin wants to go down. They could of course change tack if there still isn't any progress in the next few weeks, but even then they would be at a disadvantage compared to Ukraine, which will have had significantly more time to mobilise.

In short, while still not a likely prospect, it is entirely feasible that if this war is not resolved in the near future, that Ukraine will be able to use its manpower advantage to push Russia back, and potentially even out. If this conflict is still ongoing in the summer or autumn, I wouldn't discount that as a possibility.",b95139625d5fc98b118f91c105ed75b179f47870,True,False,,,,,0,1647268322,,0,{},i0mcsy2,False,t3_tdxg6p,False,True,t1_i0m64c7,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tdxg6p/ukraine_megathread_march_14/i0mcsy2/,1647268339,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647239522.0

At the current rate of attrition the russian forces (amassed for the conflict anyway) are going to be decimated by the six month mark. The russian economy will be a shell. This is totally non sustainable from the russian side.

The ukranians get their country back and the bigger prize of fast tracked EU membership (as oposed to nato) with the pro russian element of the population having been bombed out of existence by their own motherland. 

Longer term the EU will have more robust defence of its own, rendering the nato argument somewhat moot. The current amount of western goodwill will translate into developmental aid and economic development with EU membership will follow rapidly.

&gt;*Nicholas insisted on smartly dressed, well drilled and firmly disciplined regiments that were ready to show off their spit polished sharpness in parades and demonstrations. But the army was a microcosm of the general problems of the Empire. Yes, its budget was massive, but it was bloated. The officer Corps had settled into lethargic corruption. They were skimming off the top, cooking the books, pocketing pay. There was graft and corruption on the supply chain, providing the food and clothes and boots and weapons for the soldiers. Expenditures were bled from a million little pinpricks. Meanwhile, and the common soldiers were all unhappy conscripts, serving 25 year hitches, often suffering the consequences of being badly supplied by corrupt agents.*

&gt;*And then, when they finally got into a real fight with real great powers, they lacked for everything. Their weapons were outdated. There were no railroads to speak of. The high command was stuck in the past strategically. The field officers were stuck in the past tactically. Their parade drills counted for nothing. When the shooting started, Tsar Nicholas lived just long enough to see his beloved army collapse under the weight of 25 years of corrupt stagnation. He died in February 1855, just before the final surrender in the Crimean War came refusing treatment for what turned out to be fatal pneumonia. One can only guess why he refused treatment.*",62512815a95582c49ce2c18f030090938a3a98fb,True,False,,,,,0,1647266551,,0,{},i0m8x53,False,t3_tdxg6p,False,True,t3_tdxg6p,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tdxg6p/ukraine_megathread_march_14/i0m8x53/,1647266567,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647237751.0

Its an interesting thing, that a nation can threat with Nuclear weapons and make the response weak, because of geo location. That USA doesnt want to respond militarily to a global threat, is really a new thing. 

Not that I dont understand it, after several decades of weird military adventures and now that there is an actual threat to the world, then no military intervention.

The logic must be, that the world is not in any way safer or a more dangerous place, after someone makes a threat with nuclear weapons.

So if you decide its only certain people who are allowed to shoot at you, then thats the way it is.

[],False,,OperationMobocracy,,,[],,,,text,t2_124wre,False,False,"I don't disagree with you, but there's kind of a last mile I'm having trouble getting to.  Is the ongoing existence of the Russian state at risk or is it more about reputation and image?  I definitely buy that they will be a pariah state, but is it really *that* much worse than the USSR -- secret police, gulags, a creeping totalitarian menace capable of unleashing and maybe winning WW III in Europe?

I guess I look at the worst case outcome from this situation for Russia:  Putin fights Ukraine to a stalemate, pulls back to some line Russia can afford to fortify and hold which probably amounts to the previously occupied regions + a land bridge to Crimea, give or take.  The sanctions get reduced, Russia shifts whatever exports it can to China and India at a discount and makes up some of the discount by cracking down on oligarch capital flight which is made easier by sanctions.  This cushions the blow to the economy enough to keep them form going completely bankrupt.

Yes, their image is a mess after this.  Both in terms of hard power threat and in terms of political standing and image.   But was the image even that great before?  I think there was a bit of anxiety in the Western liberal media that Putin was this cult figure shifting democracies into this pro-totalitarian, pro-Russian orbit through a mix of propaganda and political division.  IMHO, the rising tide of authoritarianism was kind of a bit of its own propaganda and was already running out of gas.  The SPD took power in Germany, not AfD, France isn't run by the FN/RN, Biden won the election in the US, and Western cohesion was remarkably quick.

I guess the big question is more likely just how bad does this get for Russia in ways that aren't recoverable in any timeline?  I do think the risk of a security service coup goes way up if it looks like Putin is willing to nearly completely sacrifice the Russian military in Ukraine or Russia's economy can't be propped up with discount exports and reduced capital flight, or maybe other internal markers not known outside of Russian intelligence.

But at this point I'd wager the security services are suffering a bit from the sunk cost fallacy.  Ousting Putin is no small task, and walking away from the war now with nothing (or very little) after all they've put into it seems like all loss.  Even though it might be smarter to think that deposing Putin might buy a ton of instant credibility for his successor and that ending the war in Ukraine and pulling out to pre-war borders would be equally beneficial in terms of ending many sanctions.",ea231c9cf9fff7795e3d473384e00147b8b87260,True,False,,,,,0,1647257047,,0,{},i0ls52z,False,t3_td1n0p,False,False,t1_i0kbjnz,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/td1n0p/perspective_putin_doesnt_fear_a_coup_by_oligarchs/i0ls52z/,1647257064,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647228247.0

&gt;What are the prospects of shifting the center of gravity of the economic life from West to East? Technically, one can imagine a new type of Peter the Great move where Russia opens not a window on Europe (what St Petersburg was supposed to be) but a window on East Asia, by, for example, moving its capital to Vladivostok and trying to shift as much as possible of economic and bureaucratic life, together with the population East. If things could be moved by decree, such a shift could even be arguably seen as quite reasonable. East Asia is, and will remain, the fastest growing part of the world. Leaving Europe, which in many ways is also a declining continent, could be seen as a right move. Russia is, with the United States, the only country in the world that can make such a radical move; for others, geography is much more of a destiny. Politically too, Russia is unlikely to be exposed to sanctions and political pressures by China, India, Vietnam or Indonesia in the same way as it is by UK, France and Germany. Finally,  a Pacific vocation could be seen as a replay of the American thrust to open the new frontier a century and half ago. Climate change might also help by making the Northern Russian territories more habitable.

I think most of my concern stems from that USA is getting unreliable.  
Not under Biden and Im fairly sure USA, will acknowledge their responsibility to the international institutions, they have been founders of and pledge itself to the current sphere of influence.

Im very very concerned with the 2024 elections in USA. More than ever.  
Whatever the world likes it or not, its pretty much a global political event.

USA seems to destabilize itself and the gab between poor and rich seems enourmous.  
So how does the world look like in 2026, when Russia has collapsed, USA withdrawn from NATO and a number of lost Russian warheads spread around the world(Not saying that will happen).

In the scenario, where USA leaves NATO, every american military asset, are going to be withdrawn from NATO countries. Europe is a tiny place, so if someone starts fireing nukes anywhere in Europe, its affecting pretty much everyone.

So how does Europe defend itself from Nuclear threats?

I don't see such a play going well. It would have to be prepared for over years to not bite back worse than it gives. While not conventionally dangerous, democratic nations not under immediate direct existential theat have real limits towards self sustained economic damage.

It's risky at best, potentially disasterous, and entirely dependant on China not taking their chance to watch the western financial order crack so as to finally get their alternative banking system in a powerful position and break the ubiquitous USD as the global pegging currency.

[],False,,June1994,,,[],,,,text,t2_fgez9,False,True,"Well firstly the situations are not very comparable. Both Iraq wars involved a heavy opening aerial component. The first Gulf War is essentially 99% air war. That's how we tend to fight our wars. The air force prepares the battlefield and the ground forces essentially mop-up. 

We did not see that in the opening phases of the Ukraine invasion. The first week featured a lot of missile strikes and a few, very few, airstrikes. There were also some relatively bizarre moves like the VDV assault on Hostomel, which resulted in heavy casualties. 

This has changed in the last few days (we're seeing a steady increase in airstrikes), but nevertheless, to quote Michael Kofman, there are hundreds of helicopters and jets sitting on airbases within range of the Ukrainian border doing nothing. 

There are several things we can glean from the current airwar. 

1. Russia hasn't neutralized the Ukrainian air force, but it doesn't appear to necessarily need to. There are very few Ukrainian sorties being flown, and airplanes have already been shot down by Russians. 
2. Russians are taking steady losses, mostly helicopters (which makes sense, every building and unit has a MANPAD).
3. Ukrainian SAMs have been destroyed, but they clearly have a lot more. 
4. TB-2 Drones are having success (though be careful of people like Oryx who claim that TB-2 Drones are having **massive** success, everyone forgets he's Turkish). 

There are a number of good theories why Russians are holding themselves back. I think they all have merit. 

1. SEAD is a hard mission Russians do not train for. So they're not going to send out a lot of planes just to get show down.

2. Russia still wants to avoid carpet-bombing indiscriminately, it makes political negotiations and resolutions to this conflict harder. 

3. They're holding the air force back in case there is an actual No-fly zone over Ukraine. They have to be prepared for a NATO intervention. It's a non-zero chance at this point.

It's hard for me to make an assessment of this war, and most experts who specialize in Russia are also avoiding making general, sweeping statements. The information environment is rife with, believe it or not, Ukrainian and Western propaganda. Now I realize how this makes me sound, but it's the truth. The most egregious example is probably the Snake Island debacle, and it really does illustrate the current problem with relying on Twitter and on Oryx. We simply do not have an accurate picture. 
 

To summarize here's a few points on why it's far too early to make an assessment. 

1. The information environment is just unhelpful. The fog of war is immense.
2. The majority of Russian capabilities have not been employed. And I'm not talking about things that many Twitter checkmarks want to claim ""don't exist"". Things like Russia's recon-fire and next-generation munitions. I'm talking about simple Su-34 bombing runs with Soviet era munitions. 
3. Russia's original goals and plan were clearly ludicrous and unworkable. They are reorganizing and rethinking their approach. We have to account for that so that we don't take the wrong lessons about air defense and airwar against Russia.",50f2f82b9fc05e6b621bb51f8a24a6ec60dc36b6,True,False,,,,,0,1647220987,,0,{},i0kaxob,False,t3_tcghy9,False,True,t1_i0k45b0,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tcghy9/comparing_ukrainian_air_defences_to_iraqi_air/i0kaxob/,1647220999,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647192187.0

""Beyond the pale"" is actually a colloquial expression, not an IR concept. I'm glad you're following. 

&gt;It wasn't lip service, the US worked with international inspectors for a decade before Hussein threw them out of the country and disconnected monitoring cameras.

I'm not sure how one can classify Powell's presentation at the UN as anything but lip service. I recall watching it live and thinking ""..what? Is this really *it?""* I'm actually a little surprised as I don't think I've heard someone genuinely try to claim that the US invasion of Iraq was somehow anything but a gross breach of international norms and laws. To reiterate, youre basically saying that the US tried to follow international norms and laws with regards to the Iraq War, and then when that didn't work out they decided to forego the UN and invade Iraq but that's actually not really a bad outcome? And that this was done for.. humanitarian reasons? Really? To quote your President, ""come on man.""  

By the way this is, actually, the crux of the Kremlin's position: that the ""rules-based international order"" only exists when the guarantors of said order find it convenient. In other words, America is free to violate that order when they please, but if anyone else does, the Americans will force regime change. You can read more about this [here.](https://www.understandingwar.org/report/how-we-got-here-russia-kremlins-worldview) It goes a long way to explaining the Kremlin's view on this issue and is a little bit more nuanced than ""lol america bad too."" 

&gt;Ah, the fine, but have you considered that ""America Bad"" argument. Well clearly then\* since the US overthrew Arbenz in 1954, the US has lost the ability criticizing purposefully bombing a city into dust in 2022.

Oh please. This is *not* my argument.To make it abundantly clear my point is simple: Americans calling for Russians to overthrow their government because of Russia's gross violation of international rules and norms should consider: 

1. The immense difficulty of doing so in a repressive state 
2. Their own (relative) inaction when their government engaged in the wholesale destruction and occupation of Iraq. 

Nowhere have I claimed that American wrongs make Russia right. We should, as analysts of this particular crisis, try to envision things from the Russian perspective and our own hypocrisy is relevant when it comes to this particular issue. 

&gt;The weakness of this argument is underlined by the fact that Russia is currently bombing humanitarian relief corridors to purposefully maximize civilian deaths

Please quote my posts where you think I support this.

It wasn't lip service, the US worked with international inspectors for a decade before Hussein threw them out of the country and disconnected monitoring cameras.

Further, this is an argument against all treaties and the UN. Having set of rules and a process is vastly better than not, in that (1) in some cases the process works (2) it allows everyone to see what's happening and adjust their policies, rather than being surprised and accidental escalation (the primary concern with Ukraine right now).

Yes, the US didn't abide by the final decision. Every situation won't be successfully resolved within those rules (Iran is in the NPT), but having them and attempting to follow them is better than not.

[Russian Ground Forces: 280,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Ground_Forces)

[Russian Airborne Forces: 45,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Airborne_Forces)

Wow look at that, 325k. Which was my original claim about the size of their ground and airborne forces which you argued was wrong. Your ""20% tops"" would mean no more than 65k troops yet you concede that around 150k of ground and airborne troops are in Ukraine. Perhaps you should go back to third grade arithmetic. That or stop pulling numbers out of your ass and cowering when asked for a source. 

&gt;Not if that was what they had in the area.

They have been doing large scale exercises in the area for the better part of three hundred years now, that does not necessarily translate to competency in whoever happens to be there.


The equipment and troop build up was well documented. The 41st Combined Arms Army was from the Central Military District and the 5th, 29th, 35th, and 36th were from the Eastern Military District. All those armies have elements involved in the invasion of Ukraine. I'm sure they just picked units at random and not based on readiness when taking them across all of Siberia. 

The build up took place over nearly a year. It wasn't ""whatever happened to be there"". 

&gt;I think to explain things in a way which makes sense, rather than to chug propaganda like a competitive sport.

No you make up numbers and handwave away facts you don't like. You provide zero sources, the ones you reference don't back up your claims, and you are eager to paint Russia in a good light whenever possible. Sure, you don't chug propaganda and just try to be logical...

Based on this, and your claims about wars in general (lol at the US ""invading"" instead of defending Korea in the 50s), the simplest explanation is that you are only interested in painting the US in a bad light and anyone against the US in a good light.

[],False,,reddituserperson1122,,,[],,,,text,t2_3jczck00,False,False,"A humanitarian aid corridor is a very calibrated escalation that weakens Russia/strengthens NATO in a couple of ways: 

1. Unilaterally imposed (i.e. not negotiated with Russia) humanitarian aid flights would show NATO asserting itself and being willing to take risks, which makes NATO's position stronger if future escalation is needed. In other words, by showing our willingness to take this small risk now, it makes any additional threat more credible, and likewise imposes a higher presumed cost for any future threat Putin wants to make.

2. Because the flight paths would vary (assuming Russia doesn't want to shoot down a plane) they would probably have to curtail their use of SAMs and use fighters to visually identify targets and deconflict airspace which would tie up resources. It would buy the Ukrainian air force some breathing room.

3. If Russia does shoot down an aircraft, (sorry to be cold and calculating) then that would be blatant and undisguised war crime, and would also give us important information about Putin's mindset and how far he is willing to go, which would help calibrate future deterrence and minimize the risk of accidental escalation.

4. NATO would have to decide how to respond to a shoot-down, but at least it would be us proactively setting the terms of an escalation and making Putin respond, instead of the other way around. It is, for example, much better for the narrative we want to build that Putin is a criminal aggressor if the escalation is that he shoots down an unarmed humanitarian plane, versus the escalation being that NATO increases military aid to Ukraine, and Putin blows up some trucks on the Polish border. That story allows Putin to say, ""see — NATO is fueling this war and I am just defending Russia"" which is the bullshit story he wants to sell. 

5. We could decide to do nothing if Putin shoots down a plane. We still need China,  India, Israel, etc. to join the sanctions regime and decisively turn against Putin. A deliberate shoot-down would put enormous pressure on allies of Russia and would be a powerful diplomatic tool, like KAL 007 was.

And if Putin wanted return to pre-war lines of control soon, I don't think Ukraine could realistically refuse that offer. That's the most likely outcome right now - a lot of dead on both sides, and nobody achieving anything.

There are still scenarios where Crimea goes back to Ukraine, like:

* NATO intervening
* NATO sending so damn many weapons to Ukraine, that it legitimately defeats Russian forces
* Russian government collapsing to coup or civil unrest
* Russia basically trading Crimea for end of sanctions (not the current bullshit sanctions, but if Russian energy exports were blocked, that would be a different story)
* China cutting off Russia, and Russian economy totally collapsing

None of these scenarios is terribly likely, but if you add them all together, one of them could happen.",749fa2b1fb7a47215493cd688c33e2d943529ff5,True,False,,,,,0,1647216064,,0,{},i0k0mja,False,t3_td6gzn,False,True,t1_i0j8ice,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/td6gzn/ukraine_megathread_march_13/i0k0mja/,1647216080,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647187264.0
