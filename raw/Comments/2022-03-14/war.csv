Subsequent articles in The Lancet and Al Jazeera have suggested that the number of cases of birth defects, cancer, miscarriages, illnesses and premature births may have increased dramatically after the first and second Iraq wars, due to the presences of depleted uranium and chemicals introduced during American attacks, especially around Fallujah, Basra and Southern Iraq

My numbers for Chechyna were spot on. Based on your own quotes 50,000-250,000 for Chechyna including militants is perfectly reasonable.

&gt; The NCCI is an alliance of approximately 80 international NGOs and 200 Iraqi NGOs, formed in Baghdad in 2003. The report, based on survey research of the nation's civilian population, found that 70 percent of the Iraqi population lacks proper access to water supplies. Only 20 percent of the population has proper sanitation and 30 percent of children experience malnutrition. About 92 percent of children experience problems learning.

Population-based studies produce estimates of the number of Iraq War casualties ranging from 151,000 violent deaths as of June 2006 (per the Iraq Family Health Survey) to 1,033,000 excess deaths (per the 2007 Opinion Research Business (ORB) survey). Other survey-based studies covering different time-spans find 461,000 total deaths (over 60% of them violent) as of June 2011 (per PLOS Medicine 2013), and 655,000 total deaths (over 90% of them violent) as of June 2006 (per the 2006 Lancet study). Body counts counted at least 110,600 violent deaths as of April 2009 (Associated Press).

Iraq

For the period from 1994 to 2009, estimates ranged from 50,000 to 250,000 civilians and 10,000 to 50,000 Russian servicemen killed.

All those things you said about Afghanistan and Iraq is the same thing as Putin saying ""we are fighting neo-Nazis in Ukraine."" You are completely ignorant of the long history of U.S. and Russian involvement in Afghanistan and the hand they played in turning those nations into fragmented failed states. The Taliban was armed by the U.S. to fight Russia... ISIS was armed by the U.S. to fight the Syrian Govt... 

The media printed the propaganda provided by the CIA, with no attempt to challenge it. There no point in trying to convince you because you have already made your mind up.

I stand with the Ukrainian people because I do not want to see Ukraine destroyed like the other countries I have witnessed in my lifetime.

Because I, an Iraqi, who hated also hated Saddam, can look at the fact that before the 2003 invasion there were 0 suicide bombing and 0 car bombing in Iraq, and realize that the U.S. invasion was not for the benefit of the people or Iraq. Also, I am half Kurdish, the people gassed by Saddam Hussein. He was an evil piece of shit but the U.S. is not better. That is just fact whether you like it or not. I refuse to ignore one evil just because another evil exists.

I do not want the people of Ukraine to experience the same thing that my parents experienced. That my wife's family, who is Yemeni, is currently experiencing in Yemen under the brutal invasion by Saudi, with U.S. approval and weapons.

What I see is 2 superpowers fighting for their own interests, and the people of Ukraine are caught in the middle. I know how important it is to stand up for the Ukrainian people and challenge Russian aggression because I know first hand the terrible fate that the people of Ukraine are facing.

I said ""resist"" like Vietnam - as in I hope the people of Ukraine make Russia's military suffer the way the Vietcong made the U.S. military suffer.

I am not here to debate which wars are justified and which are not, I am here to explain my view that the ""whataboutism"" is not a contest, but an equivalation. I am against Superpowers invading poorer, smaller nations because we can look at Iraq and Afghanistan and Yemen as say ""Holy shit we must stop this or Ukraine will end up the same.""",973cfd3ae93a685c313cecf18afe6d5b523c9aff,True,False,,,,,0,1647289629,,0,{},i0nulya,False,t3_tdsf74,False,True,t1_i0nher9,/r/war/comments/tdsf74/double_standards/i0nulya/,1647289645,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1647260829.0,,,,

Most armies don't. They'll generally have *guards*, but those are for security, not offense. *Specifically*, most armies don't because sticking big weapons on them is itself a war crime, and draws fire. The place where you *will* see that is particularly brutal insurgencies and warlord-like paramilitaries such as are most often found in the more unstable of African nations.

In 20 years of war, how many hospitals did the US bomb - regardless of accidentally or intentionally? Compare that to how many hospitals the RF bombed in... what, 18 days?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It's for the exact same reason why Ukraine started handing out weapons and explosives to random civilians, because when Russian troops inavitably butcher these hotch potch militians or the militias themselves decide to go rogue and turn into bandits, they can just accuse Russia of war.

When you're fighting an army over 3 times the size of yours, and *every single citizen* on your side has military experience due to compulsory service, it's because you need the manpower. Not because you hope that the International Court will suddenly start being effective at enforcing the Geneva Convention of 1949 for the first time in its history.",fe7fc0d790c490e2fa2e63911393d082b4dd7aba,True,False,,,,,0,1647281612,,0,{},i0na30z,False,t3_tdsf74,False,True,t1_i0n3rqa,/r/war/comments/tdsf74/double_standards/i0na30z/,1647281625,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1647252812.0,,,,

It's for the exact same reason why Ukraine started handing out weapons and explosives to random civilians, because when Russian troops inavitably butcher these hotch potch militians or the militias themselves decide to go rogue and turn into bandits, they can just accuse Russia of war.

You're not directly, which is better than the others that shamelessly defined the warcrimes but your entire argument of ""nOw iS nOt tHe tImE"" is respectfully bs.

Hypocrisy is inevitable for all powers, because ideals often don't match with the real world. Every major political power in history has their hypocritical moments, and honesty is often unrewarded. 

&gt;I understand your point, but I disagree... I personally see war as part of humanity and not embracing and regulating it properly can lead to destruction of people who are not involved... I think that nations adopting hedonistic beliefs leads them also to care less about what the consequences of an ungoverned, unrespected war can be. Maybe a bit too idealist but that's just my opinion.

There are alternative ways to have conflict without 'warfare'. In a way, the whole 'sanctions' response is one good alternative. One nation putting their economy against others. This seems to be a route that China is aiming for and I support this method of power projection, as it encourages rivals to focus on their economies (and ideally the development of their people) as well, instead of self-destructive arms development. At some point, you'll hit a point where almost everything in your arsenal can end the world. What is best for humanity is conflict that minimizes destruction that threatens humanity. Of course, this is my opinion.

&gt;But what if these goals can be seens as.... righteous? atleast by one side.... conflicts happen when there's no other way to settle disagreements, they happen when two incompatible  philosophies clash, mostly. But warlike culture is definitely not good. I liked the idea of neutral orgs at first but then they turned out to be not so neutral. I still think we can strive to make something similar tho.

The problem with 'righteousness' is that its' relative to the culture and individual. To invade others (or generally to use violence) to spread or uphold your 'ideas' inevitably leads to a point where conflict spirals out of control since everyone has their own experiences and tries to protect or impose their version of 'righteousness' on the other. 

The situation thus far is at risk of spiraling out of control due to 'righteousness' from my perspective, in terms of on one side, a 'righteous' desire to reclaim the glories of the past against the hedonistic West, verses an 'righteous' perception that this is a democratic holy war against an autocratic invader. We aren't there yet, but there's a feeling its' heading that direction. Neither side is 'right' or 'wrong' from this perspective, but unless a compromise is reached (where no one has everything they want, but they have something), it'll keep escalating because people are still angry tribal monkeys at heart. The more this conflict continues the more polarized each side will become. 

&gt;Don't understand what you mean... if you're saying that people are free to criticize the US then you're not entirely wrong or right... there's alot of people that criticize the US and are free, there's also alot who did and got incarcerated or were in an environment where they can be killed. There was this list of people mysteriously killed after criticizing the gov... and it wasn't even about war.

It is not a cultural norm that critics disappear. If it were, then honestly Western media wouldn't be as obscenely chaotic as it is now. That we are having this discussion at all is evidence, although I do not reject the possibility that it may not be so. Things do happen, those with power/wealth can as ever freely do whatever they want.",a4503e7d7d97174a68b72743a373291af88a4d20,True,False,,,,,0,1647277120,,0,{},i0myfkt,False,t3_tdsf74,False,True,t1_i0mstsz,/r/war/comments/tdsf74/double_standards/i0myfkt/,1647277137,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1647248320.0,,,,

Fair point, this isn't to make people act surprised, this is just to show them that what they think is free media, is just stated owned behind the scenes one way or the other. The US wasn't the only hypocrite superpower to ever exist.

&gt;War itself is a crime in my opinion as is the usage of it to achieve political ends.

I understand your point, but I disagree... I personally see war as part of humanity and not embracing and regulating it properly can lead to destruction of people who are not involved... I think that nations adopting hedonistic beliefs leads them also to care less about what the consequences of an ungoverned, unrespected war can be. Maybe a bit too idealist but that's just my opinion. 

&gt;Ideally, everyone stops invading each other to achieve their goals. 

But what if these goals can be seens as.... righteous? atleast by one side.... conflicts happen when there's no other way to settle disagreements, they happen when two incompatible  philosophies clash, mostly. But warlike culture is definitely not good. I liked the idea of neutral orgs at first but then they turned out to be not so neutral. I still think we can strive to make something similar tho.

&gt;But they don't usually disappear when they do that.

Don't understand what you mean... if you're saying that people are free to criticize the US then you're not entirely wrong or right... there's alot of people that criticize the US and are free, there's also alot who did and got incarcerated or were in an environment where they can be killed.

Germans and Russians are fighting each others from trench to trench for weeks without any gain on each side.

German Officer:""Soldiers we are not making any gains. Any ideas how to kill the russians?""

German Soldier:""Well, many of them go by the name Ivan. Why don't we try to just call and shoot them?""

German Officer:""Who in the world would be so stupid? But on the other hand, it's worth a try.""

So the German wait until the next morning and then start to shout.

Germans: ""Ivan""

Russian Side several Soldiers get up and shout: ""Yes, here?""

Germans shoot them immediatly. Peng! Peng! Peng! (german for pow pow pow)

This goes on for days with all kind of russian names and with great success for the germans until one Russian Officer decides to put an end to this.

Russian Officer:""Soldiers, the german are outsmarting us. We need to copy their tactics to survive. Any idea for the most common german name?""

Russian Soldier:""Most of them are called Fritz.""

Russian Officer:""Alright then, let's go and shout their names. And when they show up shoot them.""

Russian Soldiers immediatly go into their positions and start shouting:""Fritz!""

The truth is something in between, Turkey is extremely important to the west and that's why the west can't leave it completely independent. One of it's importances; Turkey denied access to the infamous İncirlik airbase to NATO back when the invasion happened, but they couldn't do the same in the recent war as they were threatened with extreme sanctions this time around.  If you ever think the NATO truly cares about the Kurds then you're delusional and misinformed, they only use them as a card against Turkey but they have abandoned the Kurds many many times. NATO also doesn't want to lose that card, which is why they didn't include Turkey in their collation against IS, because they know Turkey cares more about the PKK threat than IS and they'll simply use this and bomb the fucking living shit out of the Kurds... which ironically they got to anyway, nothing the US or NATO can do about it in the end... not worth damaging their loyal satrap's relations and having him rebel from their control. They simply don't and never cared about the Kurds and lives that'll be lost. That is just one example to show you how independent and non-autonomy from the west Turkey can be at the same time.

As for erdo he's a democratically elected president who became more of a dictator later. r/ turkey is filled with edgy 14yos who don't know shit about shit. I've been there and I know what actual Turks (from various political leanings) think about the situation, at best this sub only represent one political wing.

&gt;And what does israel being a western ally have to do with it? Saudis a western ally Iraq maybe.? 

Big difference buddy, Israel IS the west's ally.... Saudi is just an oil ally, they'll abandon the retarded nobility there when they no longer have any oil. They won't do the same with Israel, you might think I'm crazy for saying this but the US does tailor the rest of the MENA so it can fit with Israel and grants them stability, that's why the always refused to negotiate and accept even favorable terms by Islamic groups or just opposition groups that may seem to may even in the slight be a danger to Israel in the future. That's why they've started easing with Iran too, because they know they're a lesser of near threat than any of these ideals.

&gt;And didn’t European Jews also flee to Palestine to escape nazi Germany?

True, but Israel made it's legitimacy from the ones that were already in Palestine or came from other MENA places. no one wants the Europeans, they don't belong here and they never did... they're basically colonizers.

Nato overlords…….. nato is not that kind of alliance and I’ve seen alot of what turkey has done and I doubt there bowing to some leader in nato

Idk what mena is but I’ll assume the Middle East and I’d say israel? Seams like it might be fair all tho idk and as I said Iraq scored quite well on freedom house in 2020 in a few carogories around that so they could be. And tbh the west kind of has to if your governments right now decided to implement voting changes idk what the west could do tbh like the west overall has had enough of invading random countries and I doubt they’d support the western leaders invading a country to stop a dictator let alone stop Iraq from adding voting changes so unless another Middle East country stopped you I’m a bit confused what’s stopping you unless the Middle Eastern goverment a rn do

And turkey I’m a bit confused on cause a lot in the west have called it a dictatorship but then some in r/turkey who are anti erdogan or one person said it was a democracy and I don’t see how the west is stopping you from developing could you elaborate ples?

Instruction for commanders (how to deter Armed Forces, Security Service and reconnaissance and sabotage groups of Ukraine)  
1. Act during daylight, they are more effective during nighttime. Don’t risk at night. During daytime they rest in administrative buildings. We can pass them.   
2. They install civil online web cameras (with night vision) and detect our position and movement.  
3. From the first look, enemy APC is very old. But equipped with modern sights and navigation inside.  
4. Civil vans with mortars. Shell very quick and escape.  
5. Use fake heat models for ambush deception. You can’t detect whether its real or fake ambush. And where is the real ambush.   
6. Snipers shoot from the 1-mile range and very effectively (using foreign weapon). While shooting, they use infrared backlight and can be detected.  
7. In rear positions there are a lot of sabotage reconnaissance groups and local populace informers. No civilians in the AOR! Every person in your unit AOR is potential intel agent or fire spotter regardless age, sex or appearance.  
8. You must train in using your mortar assets effectively. Target detected – immediate fire!  
9. Their snipers, artillery, and sabotage groups (trained by foreign instructors) are very effective in destroying our C2 units. Consider their 8-years combat experience. Underestimation of the enemy bring losses.   
10. About navigation errors. There is no such thing as inaccuracy. Of Corse you may find inaccuracy if you know the terrain. For example, North on navigation and compass could be shown on different directions. Or your current point can move even when you hold position. It is mandatory to use compass.   
11. During operating of Elerone (Russian UAV) stream could be unacceptable. Maybe because of EW. They intercept signal of our UAV and steal them.

The US DID conquer, installing puppet govs there is just how modern empires conquer other nations. They're losing Iraq to Iran, because of many mistakes they made but I don't have to get into that.... they still haven't lost it yet.

&gt;How is turkey semi independent? They are completely independent idk what you mean how are they not independent?

They dare not disobey their NATO overlords in major matters.... A coup was literally orchestrated by a group the US holds in its soil and when it failed, NATO is doing it's hardest to defame that too disobedient of satrap there. That is just an oversimplification of what it's like.

&gt;You just need to vote them out don’t you?

Hahahaha, that is one good joke.... You think there's ever a fair democracy in the MENA??? maybe in some minor ones there're but in the majority there isn't. And just fyi most of the MENA doesn't really wants democracy in the same sense the west have, Islamic nations had a form of voting before the west ever sets foot in our soil. But they won't respect our choices in how we want to govern ourselves.

&gt;From my understanding turkey may have democracy I thought Iraq did Bahrain doesnt Saudi 

Correct, Turkey does have democracy mainly... except when a certain dictatorish guy is in power now but that's a whole lotta of something else... and like I said not everything that's wrong with the MENA is the fault of the west, but a whole lotta of it is. Or atleast the west is stopping the MENA from developing.

&gt;not sure about Lebanon israel does palastine does soo if there is democracy then there doesn’t need to be a revolution

Lebanon is just another mess, lets not get into it. But it's not entirely the US's fault in this one, Hezbollat is the problem mainly. Israel is western nation in all but name, it's a western ally, not what I meant in my comment. Palestine is also a mess but it's cuz of Israel ofc. And before we get into the Palestine-Israel fuckfest (which I don't want to), I just want to let you know that Israel would've never existed were it not for the Westren backed arab leaders which started persecuting Jews out of nowhere which have lived alongside Muslims and Christians for a long time there.

&gt; genocide
A genocide means to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.
According to population charts, [Israel is really bad at genocide](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/state-of-palestine-population/). Actually, Israel is so bad at genocide, that it’s [population growth rate](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/israel-population/) is even smaller than that of Palestine and is going down. (Maybe I should start saying it’s the Israeli population that is undergoing genocide).

So please whatever your opinion is, before using words such as “genocide”, “apartheid” and more, please do the research. I’m sure there are much more fitting words that can convey your opinion without comparing Israel to the Nazis.

&gt;nuclear weapons are a bluff unless Russia ends up in a direct conflict with the West that they cannot win

Though I see your reasoning, Russians are already battling 11 miles away from Poland, this can get nasty anytime. And I honestly don't see any scenario in which Russia can win a war against the West, should China remain more or less neutral. That's why I worry about nuclear weapons being used, as sort of an option of last resort 

Also, I don't see aging population (long-term problem) as a critical factor in a war (short-term thinking)

I thought he was hiding to protect himself from strange accidents that could happen to him (like in Haiti last year)? But yeah, if he is hiding from his own people, that's good news

I didn't know that, also good news. Do you have sources? Today finding reliable information in internet is quite tricky for regular people like me

This is totally out of my field of knowledge. Does India have a powerful military / would they pose a big threat? Who would be their ""natural"" alliance: communist block or free world?

Pretty much any reason other than a direct attack on themselves would leave many many options on the table for continued dialog.

They could have presented an ultimatium or found a 3rd party like China or Isreal to try and work thru the issues. Ukraine may have just said ""forget the Donbas and Crimea. We just want to be left alone."" If faced with the option of ""If you dont promise to stay out of NATO you are being invaded to demilitarize you and prevent you from joining NATO"" Ukraine may have talked.   
The choice was made by Putin and by the Russian government to launch an attack without any warning on a sovereign nation with the right to self determination.   


Even if the US sent the CIA in to help fuel the flames of a pro-western revolution then russia is welcome to do the same. 

They reason they don't, can't, won't is because they literally have no support in the parts of the country that are not ethnic Russian and the only way to impose their will is thru direct force. 

Ukrainians do not want to be Russians. There is a long history of Ukrainians being shit on by Russians and other rulers. They are the home of the Cossacks whos name is Turkic for ""free man""

On the day of the massacre, Abeer's father Qassim was enjoying time with his family, while his sons were at school.\[16\] In broad daylight, the four U.S. soldiers walked to the house, not wearing their uniforms, but wearing army-issue long underwear to look like ""ninjas"",\[10\] and separated 14 year-old Abeer and her family into two different rooms. Spielman was responsible for grabbing Abeer's 6-year-old sister, who was outside the house with her father, and bringing her inside the house.\[17\] Green then broke Abeer's mother's arms (likely evidence of a struggle that resulted when she heard her daughter being raped in the other room) and murdered her parents and younger sister, while two other soldiers, Cortez and Barker, raped Abeer.\[18\] Barker wrote that Cortez pushed Abeer to the floor, lifted her dress, and tore off her underwear while she struggled. According to Cortez, Abeer “kept squirming and trying to keep her legs closed and saying stuff in Arabic,” as he and Barker took turns holding her down and raping her.\[19\] Cortez testified that Abeer heard the gunshots in the room in which her parents and little sister were being held, causing her to scream and cry even more as she was being violently raped by the men. Green then emerged from the room saying, ""I just killed them, all are dead"".\[20\] Green, who later said the crime was ""awesome"",\[21\] then raped Abeer and shot her in the head several times. After the massacre, Barker poured petrol on Abeer and the soldiers set fire to the lower part of the girl's body, from her stomach down to her feet. Barker testified that the soldiers gave Spielman their bloodied clothes to burn and that he threw the AK-47 used to murder the family into a canal. They left to ""celebrate"" their crimes with a meal of chicken wings.\[22\] Meanwhile, the fire from Abeer's body eventually spread to the rest of the room, and the smoke alerted neighbors, who were among the first to discover the scene.\[2\] One recalled, ""The poor girl, she was so beautiful. She lay there, one leg was stretched and the other bent and her dress was lifted up to her neck.""\[11\] They ran to tell Abu Firas Janabi, Abeer's uncle, that the farmhouse was on fire and that dead bodies could be seen inside the burning building. Janabi and his wife rushed to the farmhouse and doused some of the flames to get inside. Upon witnessing the scene inside, Janabi went to a checkpoint guarded by Iraqi Army soldiers to report the crime. Abeer's 9- and 11-year-old younger brothers, Ahmed and Mohammed, returned from school that afternoon to find smoke billowing from the windows. After going to their uncle's home, they returned to the house only to be traumatized, finding their father shot in the head, mother shot in the chest, 6-year-old sister Hadeel shot in the face, and 14-year-old sister Abeer's remains burning.\[6\]",a9e7c13d28396d7e838834ed09fe7bc6ad6cfff8,True,False,,,,,0,1647230065,,0,{},i0ksr01,False,t3_td9vnr,False,True,t1_i0k4ney,/r/war/comments/td9vnr/on_this_day_little_abeer_qasim_was_savagely_raped/i0ksr01/,1647230079,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1647201265.0,,,,

The same comment you made few hours ago, exactly it. Whenever Westerners see Arabs they start calling them hateful stuff among them is this and the ofc famous ""goatfucker"" when ironically it's their soldiers who commit these crimes and it's their countries that allow beastility.

&gt;Since you're so aware of generalizations, shouldn't you understand that these are just fucked up people?

Alot of the US soldiers are fucked up, they choose fucked up people and that's why they commit these crimes.

&gt;The fact that they're westerners has nothing to do with it. Why did you feel the need to say that? That's something you need to think about.

If you look at my og comment I said ""Westerners who call us..."" so I specified a certain type of Westerners, I didn't generalize.... it's not my fault you didn't read.

Not sure what are you asking, but to put simply some of these govs are independent like Iran, some of them are semi-independent like Turkey who still loyal to the west in the end but will do things in the for their interest since they have became a regional power in the last few years.

The reactions of how how things play along after his fall is similar to every place where dictatorships fall, a time of confusion, disorder in things and a somewhat degree of chaos might occur because is change taking place.

Usually the state that looses the dictatorship will eventually reach a balanced point and re-emerge hopefully as a more free state. But it needs caution and nurturing of values such as freedoms, democracy, liberties, justice, respecting of human rights as well as other values.

The population must support a reform and participate in the shifts of power and adopt a ""rebuild out of nothing"" stance as well as keeping and eye out for extremists or other dictators or totalitarian groups not to re-emerge.
