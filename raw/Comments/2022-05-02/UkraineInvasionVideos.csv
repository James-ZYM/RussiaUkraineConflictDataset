Yes but their weapons and artillery no longer matches the range and accuracy of Ukraine. And Ukraine has a shit ton of artillery now and they are trained on it. The realities on the battlefield have changed drastically. We're sitting here discussing it but the people in the know have been preparing for it. 

Russia celebrates victories no matter how they were won. Remember Russia only survived Hitler because it was a cold damn winter of -30 degrees Celsius. The Nazis froze at Moscow's door step. Any other time of year and Russia wouldn't exist.

The defection rates are high as always for Russia and that's only going to get worse when the bodies stack up. Morale is at an all time. Russia is not prepared for this, it never was. Half of its munitions don't work or became victim of corruption. C-4 2x4s!!, unexploded missiles, it's not good! Fuel depots and weapon depots are burning up in Russia now because the manager of these facilities have been skimming for years and now they're about to get caught so they burn the evidence. 

You are seeing desperation. They can use nukes but they still lose.

Putin is delusional that anything Soviet was ever good and he's trapped there in Soviet times. 

We've all had an inflated sense of how mighty Russia is, that's how they've been swindling the west for decades. This war exposed them and any sign of hesitation or fear fuels their resolve.

The second guy they ask him whether he's scared, which he clearly is. Then they give him a cigarette and tell him to calm down. They ask him his family name. They tell him to speak louder. They ask where he is from - Perm City in central Russia he replies. They ask him how old is he - 20 yo he replies. They asked him if he signed a contract - yes, that he signed it kind of forcibly at night and he couldn't even understand what he was signing. He is visibly scared and his words don't really make lots of sense not even in Russian probably.

The last one is the funniest one. He starts to explain how they are really a propaganda army, a theatrical army. He says they do not train a lot, but take lots of pictures and film lots of videos. How they are forced to make their cars and plant look in good condition for the pictures, but in reality, they are not. When asked if he believe that that was the second army in the world he answered that it's all window dressing, acting, filming. He finishes by telling the interviewer what he thinks about the way they are fighting and their management. He asks how can they be the second army in the world if they have no equipment if they can't even shoot.

The massive casualties the Ukrainian Army has been inflicting so far on Russian forces have been mostly poorly equipped conscripts with little to no true air support. Russia, though quite slow, is learning from its mistakes and will likely bombard the areas ahead of their advances with cruise missile strikes and fixed-wing airstrikes. They will avoid fighting in urban areas, where Ukrainian troops have had a distinct advantage. 

The Ukrainians may have a home-field advantage and all the weapons they could ask for, that definitely matters and has had an enormous effect against Russian armor especially. Their helicopters can't fly higher than treetop level for now due to the threat of MANPADs. It's had a great psychological effect on the Russians. 

But at a certain point, if Russia masses its forces correctly (big IF), the Ukrainians can be overrun no matter how many Javelins and Stingers they fire. They need to fortify whatever front they can hold on to and dig in, because this will be unlike anything we've seen so far.
