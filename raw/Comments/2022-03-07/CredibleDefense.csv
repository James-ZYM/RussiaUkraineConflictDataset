Antisemitism has a long and deep-rooted history throughout Europe and the world.  WWII wasn't started to save Jews from the Nazis, it was to protect national sovereignty because Germany got it in their heads that they needed to expand and conquer.  If they'd kept their genocide strictly within their Weimar Republic-era borders, no one would have intervened.  In fact, there was disturbingly widespread global support for the ultra-nationalism and white supremacy of the Reich, with similar movements starting to pop up in nations around the world throughout the 30s.  ""Get rid of Jews"" was unfortunately more popular than you'd hope, and substantially more popular than ""Get annexed by Germany.""  

There are streets and monuments named after horrific people in most any country.  There are a handful of politicians with nationalistic or even fascist views in every nation's government.  This isn't whataboutism, this is pointing out that the mere existence of these things isn't enough to declare that it's a ""Neo-Nazi state.""

If western leaders continue to allow Putin and Russia to outline the boundaries of any future conflict for fear of nuclear retaliation then NATO's conventional forces, unparalleled as they are, will not continue to act as a true deterrent to Russian expansionism.

The temerity of perceived wisdom in this area is more likely to lead to nuclear conflict when NATO has to decide whether it will test Russia's ""madman"" (thinking of Nixon here) strategy over an article 5 situation. A limited no fly zone over western Ukraine will allow Russia to throw some toys out of the pram but demonstrate that they cannot use their nuclear bluff with such casual ease.

And the authors are professionals, which includes the author of the paper on the Chechen wars that was published nearly twenty years ago at Rand. 

This article actually takes a look at past uses of no fly zones and is in part a historical overview that I needed to better understand how they have been used. 

One factor that I have not seen in the talk about no fly zones and even weapons delivery to Ukraine, is the risk of sensitive western technology and signals and radar intelligence. Just to turn on the radar on a fighter jet where Russian intel could examine it would be a detriment to the security of the West. 

Here is an example of the Soviet Union gaining an incredible gift by being able to examine US missile that failed to detonate in air to air combat.

The only way to defeat dug-in infantry since the invention of the musket has been shelling the hell out of them from out of their effective range until they have been degraded enough for your own infantry to push them out of their fortifications. The effective range of modern infantry weapons is about as far as the eye can see in an urban environment. 

A well-built modern building is a few sandbags short of a castle, capable of projecting fire superiority along its lines of sight and mostly impervious to small arms. Thus modern cities still require sieges, even though they don't have walls as in the days when the farthest a soldier could project serious firepower was the length of a spear. You have to take them one block at a time. Shell the hell out of dug-in infantry to degrade and suppress, capture the fortification using infantry, establish a new perimeter, move up your logistics, rinse and repeat. If you don't know where the dug-in infantry are, maybe you just shell the hell out of any building that could be used as a fortification, or maybe you have strict ROE and you don't. In either case, if the fortification happens to have been a residence, an office building, or a place of worship, that's just too bad. 

When the ISF and Coalition forces besieged Mosul in 2016, some 20-30% of the city was destroyed, another 20-30% was badly damaged, and all utilities (water, power, sanitation) were out for most of the duration and aftermath. Most of the damage was done by well-trained, well-equipped, well-disciplined Coalition forces with strict rules of engagement, news crews watching their every move, and total air superiority - against an enemy with minimal access to anti-air and anti-tank weapons. 

Poorly trained, poorly disciplined, poorly equipped Russian forces with a dictator setting their ROE and tenuous air superiority, fighting an enemy with infinity MANPADs, are going to be worse at limiting destruction, even assuming their commanders want to. 

Massive destruction of cities was inevitable from the moment it became clear that neither side would quickly capitulate.

Yes, realist explanations remove agency from actors that do not have much power to influence the course of events, and to some extent even larger powers.

A critique of this would be an explanation that, actually, these actors *do* have the power to influence the course of events. However, this line of argumentation is not really borne out. In fact, at various points, the article itself argues against this by pointing out the massive inference in Ukrainian politics that Russia and  to a somewhat lesser degree the USA had on Ukrainian politics.

What is fundamentally a lacking critique, however, would be that realist frameworks removing agency - or recognizing a lack of impact from smaller states is *morally* or *inherently* problematic. It simply isn't. Geopolitical frameworks are a tool for analysis, and as such are fundamentally amoral. The morality comes in the ends to which these tools are applied.

In other words, it is not morally wrong to use a tought process where some actors do not have much agency, if it is actually true that these actors do not have much agency.

I am saying this as someone who does literally come from a country that is a plaything of empires and has little agency. There is nothing inherently wrong on recognizing that this is true. Yes, it is true, as the situation stands currently, there are bigger powers at play that fundamentally limit courses of actions and remove agency in many matters. Not only is this not incompatible with anti-imperialist goals that seek to recreate agency, it is fundamentally necessary for it. Pretending that reality is different from what it truly is helps no one. 

Now, it may very well be true that it is in various Eastern European country's interest to join the EU and NATO (and give up a significant amount of agency in doing so). It can, at the same time, be true that in the current geopolitical situation, these countries have little agency and have to subordinate to larger powers, to varying degrees, in order to do so - that is in fact what deciding to join the EU or NATO does, and consequentially it is not necessarily a bad thing.",3e1ce88a1795d5678ebf0227c24e2ac4268d29c3,True,False,,,,,0,1646681952,,0,{},hzqqgvv,False,t3_t8o76e,False,True,t1_hzpp87w,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t8o76e/ukraine_megathread_march_7/hzqqgvv/,1646681966,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646653152.0,

There is plenty of evidence an alternative approach would have led to a more favourable outcome. If after 1991 the West did not meddle and antagonize Russia needlessly, there is scarce reason why Russia would not have continued in a less toxic trajectory.

Indeed, there was massive pro-Western inertia in Russia after 1993, that was only tided over progressively until 2012 by key, avoidable events. US collaboration with Yeltsin leading to disastrous results, European furor against Russian actions in Chechnya, the way that the 1999 NATO intervention in Yougoslavia was conducted, the war in Iraq, progressive rounds of NATO expansion etc...

Therefore, it is a reasonable assumption that the current tensions between Russia and the West could have been avoided, since Russia has been open to Westernization for a long time despite actions that can reasonably be seen from their point of view as hostile. So it is a very reasonable conclusion that Russia would have been more amenable to Western interests, since it was that way before, and the events he points to cause this to deteriorate.

They have been preparing for this for a long time and knew the West would merely engage in finger-wagging sanctions. Therefore, these sanctions, while damaging, will do nothing to change the situation. I think it is, to say the least, infuriating, that as bombs are falling all over Ukraine's cities and people are dying, the big, bad West is seizing oligarch's yachts. It almost sounds like the punch line of a terrible joke. Putin isn't wrong to claim that the West is weak--it is. The sanctions, by design, are meant to have an effect over the long term. In practical terms, this does nothing to stop the fight, as it did nothing for the annexation of Crimea. Nor does it seem to have done enough since the sanctions were put into place all those years ago post-Crimea to deter Putin from launching this attack. Not to mention, the sanctions will take some time to fully implement (for instance, Boris Johnson said about 18 months during Prime Minister's Questions), giving the oligarchs time to sell off their assets. In other words, ordinary Russians will pay, but those who propel people to power in Russia (i.e., those part of the so-called *sistema)* will walk away with barely a scratch. Thus, they may not have a strong enough reason to see to it that Putin falls from power. Honestly, seizing an *oligarch's* yacht is barely a scratch when considering how much money they have, by definition. While the sanctions might be enough to damage the economy, this is a war against Putin, as opposed to being a war against the Russians. He gives me the impression that he doesn't really care about sanctions, because, in my opinion, they will never be enough to topple the economy as many claim, or at least inflict enough  damage to keep him from doing what he wants. The alternative, however, is that NATO engages in a full-out war against Russia and the risks of nuclear war are too high. What will end up happening is Putin will get what he wants, and once the sanctions have either been rolled back, or have failed to have their desired effect, he will launch another similar attack on god-knows-where. It's just history repeating itself once again. The books will once again present the West as having watched and done nothing.

&gt;yeah, comparable.

You're misrepresenting my question. I'm simply comparing the land area of the cities proper. I didn't say anything about the populations.  


Kyiv is still a large city which would take many more troops and heavy equipment to surround than Russia has available in the north of the country (not to mention consistent resupply).  


It just doesn't seem to be a likely tactic. That is all I'm saying.  


Their best bet is to find a weak point in Kyiv's defenses and try to strike deeper into the city, but that leaves them vulnerable in other ways, as we've seen.  


So what is the long term play here? Long term they'd probably prefer to surround the city and cut it off, but that is unlikely. As long as the defenses in Kyiv can be resupplied and communicate with forces outside the city, they can probably continue defending against Russian incursions deeper into the city.

Most modern NODs employed by US forces are now going to be autogated, so there’s no need to adjust light intensification manually based on ambient light like a bright room. As for complete darkness, that’s whole point of running an IR illuminator/laser like a PEQ, DBAL, MAWL, NGAL, etc 

As for training under NODs, it’s not that difficult, most shooting will be done passively via IR laser/illuminator.

Most of his analysis explains how the West's previous actions led to the current situation, but I find him utterly lacking in convincing arguments that an alternative approach would have led to more favorable outcome. 

It seems just as likely that we could have ended up with hostile Russia minus the NATO protection of other Eastern European states and instead we're talking about incursions in the Baltics in addition to Ukraine and so on. Russia wasn't exactly a politically stable country 30 years ago.

On top of that, the only reason he seems to believe we should have sought a softer approach to Russia is to counter China -- but that introduces another series of assumptions on his part which go again largely unsupported. After presupposing that a softer approach would have led to a friendly Russia, he presupposes that China would be signficantly weaker if the West had taken a harder approach towards them, and then presupposes that Russia would then support the West in an effort to counter China.

For my teenager, it's that it's OK that he stays up until 1:30, needs to sleep in, and that he's not really missing much in an ""easy"" class that he's doing so well in (which turns out to be a C+).

For Putin, it's this idea that NATO has a rational basis for staging a ground invasion, as if no one in NATO has read any military history for the last 250 years and thinks that all the past invasion failures were just a lack of will and enough technology.  And the idea that it could happen without a nuclear response.

IMHO, Russia probably does have valid, if extremely amorphous, economic security concerns regarding holding onto a ""top power"" position if its economy slides into a quasi-mercantilist territory of being a poor seller of raw materials only and a buyer of more expensive finished goods.  I have this vague idea that ""Russifying"" Ukraine was less about military security, and more about hoping to expand the domestic economy enough to make it viable to buy fewer imported goods, make domestic industries viable and maybemaybemaybe even gain some kind of finished goods export strength.

Ukraine as anything like independent is a loss of a good sized Russian market and will rapidly (and likely willingly) accept a role as a low-cost manufacturing hub for European corporations as well as preferring European and American consumer goods.

The hard to believe part is why ""let's invade Ukraine militarily"" was a good idea to solve Russia's economic insecurities.  I'd guess it might be because while you can kowtow the oligarchs enough to keep them out of politics *and* skim their profits for military refreshes, you can't skim their profits a second time to bootstrap the domestic consumer economy into becoming more self-sustaining.  The oligarchs demand enough profit that they expect to keep obscene profits and dispose of them where they like, such as London townhouses with 4 level basements, Manhattan highrises and 50+ meter yachts.

It's oversimple, I realize, but I kind of think Putin would have been better off putting most of the money into economic revitalization and competitiveness.",d317259104301b2c5ff4723deeb570993ea2b047,True,False,,,,,0,1646673032,,0,{},hzq3830,False,t3_t8o76e,False,True,t1_hzp7a54,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t8o76e/ukraine_megathread_march_7/hzq3830/,1646673045,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646644232.0,

Back during the cold war, Soviet ADA/SAM umbrella was downright *fearsome*, and they sold a not insignificant amount of it to client states. I think that led to the US and NATO countries in general developing substantial SEAD capacity, with missiles like the AGM-88 HARM. 

Contrast the NATO anti-air, where ADA/SAM systems almost seem to be an afterthought. Looking at the Russian SEAD gear, I'm seeing that they're still using the Kh58, which originally required manual swapping of seeker heads to target specific SAM radars (e.g. Nike vs PATRIOT). The newest version has a wideband seeker that's doubtless good against anything, but it's a post-Soviet design, so you have to wonder if they even have very many. And on top of that, is it designed to be able to target *their own* latest generation systems?

I definitely see what you mean about the end goal of resistance, I guess it's very hard to quantify when we have no idea where the conflict ends.  
  
Regarding long term occupation, I get what you mean numbers wise, but I doubt it's in any way sustainable, especially when there is a decent amount of the populace from which they'd draw replacement troops, that is aware and against the invasion already.

Yeah, well thanks to yourself for asking the right questions. I apologise if answers are slow to come back, I'm not active on Reddit much nowadays. Obviously I can't say for certain that it's sustainable long-term, it's worth noting that Russia is also suffering a bad fertility rate, just not nearly as bad as Ukraine's. I just feel they can do it with their total active and reserve numbers, probably supplemented by militia.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I think sanctions could have been the right choice, but they were too little too late. If the western powers took the invasion threat more seriously before this happened, I don't think we'd be in this situation. I think tensions would have been high, and it would be unstable, but at least people wouldn't be getting shelled at the same time.

I wouldn't have bothered with sanctions at all to be honest, with the possible exception of cutting off the banking sources of Putin himself and those closest to him. It's an unpopular viewpoint but I don't think advocates for sanctions fully accounted for just how bad the global economy was doing before implementing sanctions. We still have not fully recovered from supply chain issues and now if the prices of oil and gas keep going up, consumers will have to bear the costs. Add rising inflation to this mix and it's going to be very difficult for Western politicians to ignore domestic discontent and, more importantly, avoid a recession. 

One nightmare scenario could be if Russia cuts off gas to the EU, which then has to requisition Norwegian gas, a substantial amount of which currently goes to the UK; you then have a fissure between the UK and Europe because the former is in danger of having gas prices skyrocket, not to mention the fact that Norwegian output cannot cover the billions of cubic metres required by the EU.

I would've gone for implementing a no-fly zone in Western Ukraine early on (specifically a relatively small semi-circular section on the line Brody-Chernivtsi-Uzhhorod), on humanitarian grounds, once the independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk republics was declared and Putin announced his ""special military operation"". A lightweight mix of air defense batteries and F-16 sorties out of Poland would've made it very difficult for Russian counter-air to operate there.

I honestly struggle to imagine Putin going nuclear if a Russian aircraft was shot down as a result of such an operation, especially since A. his economy would not be suffering under sanctions, meaning he still has something to lose and B. there are still effective conventional steps he could take, steps which could certainly raise the prospect of a more direct confrontation but could still be shrugged off by NATO as acceptable losses.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What's your take on how the west would handle an economically destroyed Russian state under new, more pragmatic leadership?

With sincerely welcoming arms I would hope. We need to correct the mistakes of the past and try our absolute hardest to incorporate Russia into the European security apparatus and preferably the EU as well. If that means dismantling NATO and replacing it with an alliance that includes Russia but not, if necessary and as is likely to be the Russian condition, the United States, then existing European countries in NATO will need to put on their big boy pants and do it. Only then will future security issues in Europe be resolved without armed conflict, once *everybody* is actually allied.

One final, important point to make is that it's much more difficult to re-connect a country to global markets once they have been cut off. In the event that the sanctions regime is dismantled fully, it will take time before any actual relief is felt. It is this time which will be most crucial to preventing the rise of another autocrat like Putin - or somebody worse for that matter. Hopefully the West can prove itself amicable to the Russian people, many of whom will have been radicalised but are still not so far gone as to be unreachable.",48b5a43e0bce1e8aa7418a9084f097600d4edaf9,True,False,,,,,0,1646669420,,0,{},hzpu3gw,False,t3_t6mn73,False,True,t1_hziq5rp,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t6mn73/what_happens_after_a_discussion_on_the_potential/hzpu3gw/,1646669437,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646640620.0,

If we have learned something about this war is that Russian made SAMs are actually quite effective (the S-400 scored some long rage kills already), and that the RuAF is terrible at SEAD operations lol",da87e3810939ae71ea793a3a2eeb0fd4601fd52b,True,False,,,,,0,1646668306,,0,{},hzprdio,False,t3_t8o76e,False,True,t3_t8o76e,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t8o76e/ukraine_megathread_march_7/hzprdio/,1646668322,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646639506.0,

I see people talking about ""What Ukrainians might agree to"" in negotiations. I see many writing off Crimea as a given, given that Ukraine realistically has no way of taking it back from Russian control. However it still seems to be the biggest issue Ukrainians care about-- and formally handing over Crimea appears to be what they are against the most

Of course leaders don't make agreements solely off the will of their people, however Zelensky will definitely keep in mind where popular support is leaning. He might choose a hard stance (you withdraw, we give greater autonomy but fundamentally keep LPR/DPR, Crimea remains contested, we have the right to join NATO) to further weaken the Russian position.

At this point Russia has effectively mobilized all its forces staged upon the border. The only things left to pressure Ukraine with are 1) mass indiscriminate bombing of civs, part of Russian doctrine and they still have capability to do so, 2) mobilizing more troops

1) Is possible but would also ruin any chance at future negotiations-- Russia would have to expect to actually take and hold Kyiv and a lot of Ukraine. With an even more hostile population, requiring triple the number of troops to occupy it properly. V unlikely, but the invasion itself was ill thought out so I won't rule it out.

Will also geopolitically bolster calls for direct and indirect support for Ukraine and attacks on Russia, likely completely cut from SWIFT, China &amp; India would further distance themselves, troop morale crash, Ukrainian civs morale worsened in some places, bolstered in others, and Russian majority support of the war could turn into a minority.

Not to mention, given this would sour negotiations and force Russia to push as hard as possible-- even in the best case that have a more hostile population and more $ for rebuilding.

2) Could also occur, but would have much more domestic concerns vs international, with Russian people starting to see this more as a ""war"" over military operation and a decline in support.

Given the size of Russia, state of supplies and logistics (and civilian vehicles being used as supply truck) and the readiness of any other Russian troops, this will certainly not be some button to press to ensure a quick victory.

And even then, throwing more troops at the issue without sorting out fundamental logistics and supply issues will only exacerbate the existing issues

Instead, go into every room with your flashlights. You're busting in room by room anyway, no ninja shit happens after the very first entry. Another disadvantage to light amplification is it doesn't work in complete darkness, another advantage for gun-mounted flashlights

Another difficulty for fielding NVGs to Russian infantry is that you can't just hand them out, you have to train with them. You have to learn to shoot with them, close and distance firing. You have to train at night, which sucks. Sure, special forces can embrace the suck and master their tools, but conscripts won't

So maybe you're not in a building, you're outside. Sounds like you're going to be guarding shit or on a long patrol. Batteries become a problem. Eye sores develop.

In fact, the US military have postponed a missile test and set up a hotline to avoid mis-signalling their intentions.

Nuclear deterrence needs to be credible. Ignoring the fact that Putin might be going crazy, he has to act like it.

""I apologize if this has been discussed before, but I wanted to bring up this imaginary scenario:  
The Russian invasion army keeps losing battles against the Ukrainian defenders and are not making any significant progress towards Kyiv. The losses in equipment become too high to realistically finish the invasion with conventional weapons. Instead of accepting the defeat Putin goes completely unhinged and decides to bring nuclear weapons to the table. Similarly to WW2 in Japan he decides to use a ""small"" nuclear weapon (not ICBM) to destroy a smaller Ukrainian city. He then says Zelensky has 72 hours to unconditionally surrender and let Russia install a puppet government, otherwise Kyiv is next.  
How could NATO respond to this? Retaliating by using our own nukes against Russian targets would mean MAD. Sending in Troops to the Ukraine would be even more dangerous than before in this scenario, because Putin would have already demonstrated that he is willing to use nukes. I'm not sure how much more we could sanction Russia, since we already put heavy sanctions on them, so that is not going to be a much stronger punishment than before either.  
Am I missing something or is there really nothing we could realistically do? I'm curious to hear other people's opinions on this because this question has been on my mind a lot today.""

China cares more about western supply lines than propping up a GDP the size of Italy's.

China is certainly a powerful economy, but the nature of the Chinese state is that they will happily fuck over bankers and investors if it suits them. They've done that multiple times. 

China does not seem interested in structuring the Yuan as a reserve currency, because that would cramp their behavior and prevent them from playing games with the Yuan to suit their local economic needs.

If you're looking to China to save Russia, good fucking luck with that. They're not interested unless there are significant benefits to them.

[],False,,OneCatch,,,[],,,,text,t2_11e3n3,False,False,"&gt;When you take deliberate steps NOT to show the necessary amount of restraint while conducting military operations, you are essentially deliberately murdering civilians, yes.  

The Hague and Geneva conventions disagree with you there. They accept that some level of civilian casualties are, sadly, likely to occur. They require that attacks in civilian areas are proportionate and targeted at credible enemy targets. And they recognise the distinction between accidental deaths - even when caused by indiscriminate bombing - and actual murder.  


&gt;But we’ll play by your rules: Let me ask you this, do you really believe Russia is wasting MLRS to schwack civvies? Why would they do this?  

I think they're destroying infrastructure to pre-emptively deny it to the Ukrainian armed forces, disrupt movement and supply, and otherwise disrupt defensive operations without regard for civilians at all. To soften up cities prior to the assault, basically. As was their approach at Grozny. I'm currently not at the stage of saying they're doing it specifically to cause terror, but if it does ramp up further that's going to become difficult to deny.  

&gt;Because there really isn’t. Fallujah was an incredibly dense city, compared to Ukraine’s sparsely populated cities.  

Grozny was similarly dense to Fallujah, and it didn't stop the Russians then. Neither did it stop them in Syria. In any case, the central, dense, part of Ukrainian cities are being shelled, rocketed, and cluster bombed.  



&gt;&gt;Now that Russia has reverted to wholesale bombardment of civilian infrastructure and residences

&gt;What are you talking about? Do you really believe Russia is wholesale bombarding civilian infrastructure and residences?  

I believe that's what I said, yes. Not everywhere of course, 


&gt;This is for the year 2003 specifically.  

Would you cite the source? I'm seeing different numbers and while you might be right, I'd be interested to know which figure you're using.  


&gt;I’m guessing that’s why the US got rid of its stocks of cluster muniti-wait....It hasn’t. Almost like there’s actual strategic value to cluster munitions in-theatre.  

Area munitions are indeed useful. But when you're throwing them at cities without specific targets and without regard for the civilian population it becomes indiscriminate.  

&gt;Wait till you hear about the fact that the vast majority of coalition airstrikes are done without guidance from a JTAC.  

In Fallujah specifically? That seems remarkably unlikely given the risk of friendly fire so I'd like to see a source on that claim.

But they were also the first to do so. It requires a lot less testing when the theory has been provably demonstrated by several different states over a period of 70+ years.

The science behind nuclear weapons is not 'hard'. Obviously it is still complex, and the average man off the street couldn't begin to understand it - but it is an extremely well researched, well proven, and well tested field. Iranian nuclear scientists do not need to detonate a nuclear weapon to be sure that they could make one that works. It would be beneficial to the creation of more advanced/destructive/efficient weapons, sure - but that's different to knowing it will work.

&gt; it makes little sense to not test it and prove you actually have it.

I don't think that's the case, actually. Iran is obviously under some pretty heavy sanctions, and has been for decades, as well as experiencing a significant amount of US and Israeli espionage or interference in its affairs. Yet both of those could still be ramped up significantly - and definitely would be if Iran demonstrated it has developed a bomb.

It is also not in a position of existential threat at this moment - the US is not going to invade any time soon, and Israel or Saudi Arabia are not capable of doing so. If there is a genuine US military build up or air campaign against Iran, then perhaps we would see an accelerated weapon development and a test. 

Iran can currently count on most of the benefits of having a nuclear weapon, by virtue of having 95% of one - and avoids the North Korean-esque embargo that the US would demand if a weapon is tested. It also means that the Saudis can still feel safe under the US security umbrella, and not feel forced into developing nuclear capabilities of its own.",d6a276809327cdc91bbf0bd4904e0d789a08fb28,True,False,,,,,0,1646648268,,0,{},hzos2gy,False,t3_t819cm,False,True,t1_hzooftg,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t819cm/why_is_it_so_hard_for_iran_to_build_a_nuclear_bomb/hzos2gy/,1646648284,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646619468.0,

I’m guessing that’s why the US got rid of its stocks of cluster muniti-wait....It hasn’t. Almost like there’s actual strategic value to cluster munitions in-theatre.

&gt; I think Ukraine should give no territorial concession, period. Russia signed a treaty to respect Ukrainian sovereignty, Ukraine should demand Russia to respect it in return for not joining NATO. Ukraine's neutrality and about 2000 km of the border should convince Russia that a neutral Ukraine is better than a non-functioning Ukraine that will kick up whatever dirt it can to drag NATO into war against Russia. 

NATO doesn't request for territorial concession, it's a mutual defense pact. About Ukranian sovereignty, Russia not respecting it is the main push factor for Ukraine joining NATO. Russia hasn't been respecting Ukranian sovereignty for 8 years. Putin even said himself that Ukraine has never had it's own authentic statehood. Additionally, Putins willingness to invade Ukraine, completely throwing diplomacy off the table clearly shows Russia is in no mood to respect Ukraine sovereignty. Is that not enough for Ukraine to seek refuge  in NATO?

https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/the-other-side-of-the-coin-the-russians-in-chechnya

&gt;In contrast to the deficiencies of the Russian Armed Forces, the Chechen rebels demonstrated an almost textbook application of tried and tested insurgent tactics which proved highly effective. Chechen fighters became adept at laying ambushes, creating mines and IEDs, employing sniper warfare, using suicide bombers and bringing down Russian aircraft with SAMs. Right from the start Chechen guerrillas were well-armed as they had freely looted Soviet stockpiles of weapons in Chechnya and neighboring republics. One scholar estimates that the Chechens had ‘139 artillery pieces, numerous anti-tank weapons and nearly 40,000 firearms’ (Hodgson 2003, p. 68). Such a proliferation of weaponry allowed the rebels to target the convoys and armoured trains used to move troops and supplies between bases, usually at night. They became skilled at such attacks and in one ambush in 2004 98 Russian troops and officials were killed and 104 wounded, while all but 2 of the rebels escaped (Kramer 2004, p.24). The Chechens were also effective at urban warfare and always tried to ‘hug’ Russian units by staying within one block so that the Russians couldn’t call in artillery on their position without being hit.

&gt;Mine warfare also became highly important, causing a significant proportion of Russian deaths. Chechen rebels became highly proficient at bomb making, managing to successfully assassinate Akhmad Kadyrov, the then sitting President of Chechnya. Moreover, Chechen rebels had access to large stockpiles of Russian shells which were unexploded, bought or stolen (Kramer 2004, p. 28). This allowed the rebels to create bombs using dynamite which had a much higher explosive yield than is usual for IEDs. To make matters worse, the insurgents would use these bombs to set booby-traps, rigging everyday objects like books, beer cans and flashlights to catch Russian soldiers unawares (Thomas 2005, p. 746).

&gt;Furthermore, like ISIS today, Chechen rebels made extensive use of suicide and car bombs, employing women and children and turning every civilian into a potential threat. The insurgents were able to orchestrate multiple simultaneous attacks and in one particular incident, five coordinated car bombs at five different locations killed 24 people (Jamestown Monitor 2000). These attacks created a climate of constant fear and ensured that Russian soldiers were in a permanent condition of stress and anxiety. Another form of demoralizing, psychological warfare practiced by the rebels was sniper warfare. The Chechens relied heavily on sniper tactics, usually at night because Russian troop lacked night vision (Thomas 2005, p. 746). As well as being a highly effective way to kill enemy combatants, sniper attacks sow confusion and destroy morale. Chechen fighters relied on age-old tactics such as shooting troops when they lit up a cigarette or aiming for the groin to demoralize a soldier’s comrades and kill them when they attempted a rescue. Such methods are clearly terrifying and difficult to counter.

&gt;Finally, the Chechen guerrillas became very proficient at bringing down Russian aircraft with SAMs, ATGMs or RPGs. At the start of the war the rebels had several thousand MANPADs including the SA 7 and 14, as well as the Gremlin and Igla systems (Lambeth 1996, p. 368) which are similar in capability to the US Stinger (Raevsky 1995, p. 683). The ready availability of these weapons meant that the skies over Chechnya were far from safe and during the first six months of the First War, at least four Russian helicopters crashed or made forced landings, while another four experienced ‘significant combat damage’ (Kramer 2004, p. 34). Throughout the First Chechen War the Russians lost about 10% of their deployed helicopters due to enemy fire or malfunctions. Indeed, it is fair to say that the Russians had plenty of their own versions of ‘Black Hawk Down’. In one particularly notable incident a Su-25 was shot down. A Mi-8 Spetsnaz helicopter sent to recover the crew was then shot down before a Mi-24V Hind gunship sent on a second rescue mission was also shot down (Kramer 2004, p. 34). In another equally disastrous incident 127 Russian troops were killed when a Mi-26 Halo military transport helicopter which had been overloaded was shot down by the rebels (BBC Russian 2002).",bda7c8913cf0814d679db3ebbbaf1bbe80f42a31,True,False,,,,,0,1646635929,,0,{},hzocvbr,False,t3_t8acrj,False,False,t1_hzo7l2u,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t8acrj/russias_chechen_wars_19942000_lessons_from_urban/hzocvbr/,1646635943,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646607129.0,

A war is is a contest of a nation's production, population, and morale. 

What globalism enables is far better production, where each country can be in theory be allowed for their specialization to be more efficient.

I argue that it may not ever prevent a war from happening, but it would shorten the amount of time a conflict is hot because by cutting off critical production a country will not be able to compete in that arena with the other side unless it is drastically overmatched.

You think that there was significant deliberate effort to murder civilians with massed artillery in Fallujah? Because not even Iraq Body Count claims that.  

&gt;Because there isn’t one. Not sure why you would bring up Grozny as example in the first place, considering the strategy employed by the Russians in this war is completely different. You’re essentially just trying to predict the future based on an entirely different set of variables.  

It was initially different. Now things are looking rather more grim. The reason it's relevant is because you attempted to equivocate between MLRS use (as described by another user) with the US approach in Fallujah:

&gt;&gt;The US never launching unguided rocket artillery into cities  

&gt;You’re right, instead, the US launched unguided regular artillery into Fallujah.  

As demonstrated above, there's a world of difference between the two in terms of intent and in terms of outcome.  


*When* Russia was restricting it's artillery to military targets, or the positions of Ukrainian forces, I would have agreed with you it was behaving in a reasonably restrained manner. In fact, I [called people out](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/sza0cf/international_politics_discussion_thread/hy82b5g/) for inappropriately describing the early strikes as war crimes.  

Now that Russia has reverted to wholesale bombardment of civilian infrastructure and residences, it has lost any claim to restraint (because how can you claim to be attacking military targets with a weapon which spreads hits over the better part of a km, and when you have no forces nearby to identify military targets?). And it's also lost any claim that its conduct is somehow better than the way the West wages war because when we've seen this mode of warfare before it caused far more civilian casualties than the West has inflicted since Vietnam, or possibly Korea.


&gt;12,000 Iraqi civilians died in 2003.  

That number includes several years after the invasion. Those killed during major combat operations was perhaps half of that. And bear in mind that was the toll after the coalition had taken the whole country including the major cities and Baghdad, not some fairly small fraction of it.

&gt;Call me when the number exceeds that. We have zero moral high horse to sit upon when it comes to criticising the, objectively less destructive and punitive, approach Russia has taken towards civilians in this conflict.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Both the US and Russia built dozens cities with nuclear plants around production of Uranium-235 and Plutonium-238.

Iran isn't building hundreds and then thousands of warheads.  And modern centrifuge based plants are fairly compact.  


&amp;#x200B;

&gt;By the time they came up with adequate fissile material to construct a single warhead- congrats. Like North Korea, you've managed to create a Fat Man/Little Boy with 10-15 kton yield and negligible tactical value

And then Iran keeps going - and like North Korea the booms just keep getting bigger.  And North Korea is well on the way to developing both weapons and delivery systems of tactical usefulness.  


&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Another decade was required by the US to develop a 2nd stage (fusion) that'll greatly increase its efficiency into something that would be more terrifying.

You don't need fusion to field a tactically or strategically useful weapon.  Pure fission does the job just fine, boosted fission even better.  


&amp;#x200B;

&gt;An h-bomb, hydrogen bomb, thermonuclear- these all refer to fusion bombs in the megaton range. Russia had to rely on espionage to quickly catch up to western designs.

All existing evidence makes it clear the Soviets didn't need that much help to clone Fat Man.  And there's precisely zero evidence that espionage lead to them ""catching up"" with the West in terms of fusion weapons...  In fact, they tested a practical (dry fueled) fusion weapon before the US.  


&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Back to Iran- Iran is not a big country, has relatively few nuclear scientists- not the dream team of the best minds in America and Europe. Nor does it have the resources of a great power either, thanks in part to sanctions. So their talent pool is restricted to homegrown nuclear engineering.

North Korea seems to have done well enough.

In simple (ha) terms, aircraft need generate a lift force equal their weight to maintain steady flight. This lift force is related to a lift coefficient and dynamic pressure (function of velocity and density), either of which may vary but their product must satisfy L = W = qSCl. Simply, if you want to go higher, you must go faster in order to satisfy your lift requirements for an assumed set planform area and lift coefficient, as density is decreasing. This results in a near constant dynamic pressure for a set cruise lift coefficient that only decreases as you expend fuel. As drag is also a function of dynamic pressure, the drag generated over the flight envelope will not dramatically change for a set dynamic pressure. In short, air resistance does not dramatically decrease from take off to loiter, or even as you gain altitude if we were to only vary density. If your lift requirements are static, then the drag generated is also static and your thrust requirement is also static (though you should note that modern turbo fan engines are going to produce less thrust and be less efficient at higher altitudes, so that actually contradicts your explanation…).

Of course not. Certainty is rare in warfare, and artillery may be misdirected or simply miss. But I'd be amazed if even a significant minority of fire missions were called in on locations where there wasn't good reason to believe enemy forces were present.

Then look at the retaking of both those cities. The US and allied forces sent RCTs into the city, then relied on CAS and directed artillery. Several hundred civilian casualties.

It is also clear that the Ukrainians will receive significant external support, although I have concerns that Russia will be able to effectively monitor the border.   


Key ingredient #2: operational capacity is the one I'm most concerned about. We know that [the US has been training the Ukrainians](https://news.yahoo.com/cia-trained-ukrainian-paramilitaries-may-take-central-role-if-russia-invades-185258008.html) in something like insurgency tactics since the Obama adminstration, I'm just not comfortable assuming that the insurgency will be highly capable operationally until I see some evidence of that. On the other hand, some quotes from the article are hopeful, ""One person familiar with the program put it more bluntly. “The United States is training an insurgency.""  
But really my biggest fears are around Russia's counterinsurgery, or COIN, strategy. We've heard from [some sources](https://twitter.com/kitty_donaldson/status/1499381363010682881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1499381363010682881%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rawstory.com%2Fukraine-public-execution%2F) that Russia has plans to conduct [public executions](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10575169/Russia-planning-stage-public-executions-Ukraine-European-intelligence-official-claims.html) and has drafted kill lists that it will use preemptively once the occupation is completed, maybe even sooner. We even saw they were shipping in riot police gear from a [video of a convoy that got ambushed](https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/t7e4rd/in_the_vicinity_of_stary_saltov_kharkiv_a_large/).   
There are a lot of theories around what makes a good a COIN strategy, but the program historically favored by Russians is just brutal.   
Based on historical precedent, we might see Ukraine completely sealed off from the outside world and the resources necessary for living normally are taken away. Given the [fast-approaching commodities apocalypse](https://www.ft.com/content/5753f4dd-1e8e-4159-a4e4-d232e4ad50ed), that part shouldn't be too hard. The Russians could implement strict controls on people's lives and then coerce Ukrainians into becoming informants for basic necessities of life.  Not to mention the Russians certainly have  a substantial network of friendly actors to build on. 

But while the Russian state is certainly 'evil' enough to implement such a strategy, I'm not so sure that they possess the operational capacity for this sort of COIN strategy. They may just rely on brutalizing the population and other crude tactics.",d183a8b48f2df48a47742dc03e83cee2aed13473,True,False,,,,,0,1646612640,,0,{},hzn54i4,False,t3_t7yq5f,False,True,t1_hzn05pj,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t7yq5f/ukraine_megathread_march_6/hzn54i4/,1646612652,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646583840.0,
[],False,,pointer_to_null,,,[],,,,text,t2_9vmfr,False,False,"While the ability to create a relatively inefficient low-yield single-stage nuclear device might be ""easy"", it takes industrial scale refinement to achieve weapons-grade fissile material for such a design. This is an extremely intensive process, and takes an enormous investment- billions of dollars, an army of nuclear physicists, and infrastructure.

Both the US and Russia built dozens cities with nuclear plants around production of Uranium-235 and Plutonium-238.

By the time they came up with adequate fissile material to construct a single warhead- congrats. Like North Korea, you've managed to create a Fat Man/Little Boy with 10-15 kton yield and negligible tactical value. Iran does not have any large bomber aircraft like a B-29, nor would it be concealable on any aircraft they own. So they'd need additional years of further development to shrink it to fit a deployable weapon system- like the tip of a ballistic missile or a AGM.

As well as a decade or more to develop a 2nd stage (fusion) that'll greatly increase its efficiency into something that would be more terrifying. An h-bomb, hydrogen bomb, thermonuclear- these all refer to fusion bombs in the megaton range.

Iran is not a big country, has few nuclear scientists- not the dream team of the best minds in America and Europe. Not the resources of a great power either, so their talent pool is restricted to homegrown nuclear engineering.

Most importantly, Mossad is frighteningly effective- Iran's nuclear program seems to have more moles than Yoshi's Island 2. Some moles willing to introduce sophisticated state-developed viruses to destroy expensive precision centrifuges needed to refine fissile material.
