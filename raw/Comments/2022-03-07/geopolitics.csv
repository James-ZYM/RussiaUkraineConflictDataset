[],False,,PausedForVolatility,,,[],,,,text,t2_55x96iwp,False,False,"We've seen a few rounds of negotiations already (three?). This is a bit more of a serious negotiation, rather than what looks like a pro forma negotiation, and Russia has already scaled back from what it sounds like it initially wanted to what they recently said they wanted (Donbas territory to separatists, constitutional amendment for neutrality, ""finish demilitarization""). 

I think this decision to step up the intensity of negotiations by having them occur on NATO territory is a signal that Russia is *either* more willing to negotiate or they're just generating another smokescreen. I'm leaning towards the latter. Russia's stated demands for an end of hostilities are a poisoned pill.

To answer your follow up questions:   

* Russia will be able to replace their hardware over time. Given the scale of losses, that replacement will be expensive and onerous. It has also been demonstrated that their logistical system is inadequate; they'll need to spend to expand that, also. Depending on how bad Russia's finances are when all is said and done, they might be able to borrow money and replace their losses in a few years or they may be looking at a decade plus timeline.

* The EU's influence is trending up in the Black Sea. Turkey is mulling over a canal to turn their capital into an island, which would allow Turkey to bypass the Montreux Convention. This means probably faster transits for EU states who are shipping goods up and down the Danube as well as a means to militarily bypass Montreux (this mostly benefits the US, but also France). China also has a wild plan to basically dig a canal from Greece through Serbia to reach the Danube. It's unclear which of these (if either) will be done.

* Russia will absolutely find it harder to influence foreign nations. A significant part of their clout is based on their military power and intelligence services, both of which failed in the invasion of Ukraine. They're also increasingly isolated from Europe. Germany, for instance, has bumped up their stated goal to 100% renewable by 2035, as opposed to 2050. That means Russia will not only have a 15 year period where they have functionally no purchases from Germany, it also means that Germany will wean itself off faster. And Germany's one of Russia's biggest consumers. Additionally, depending on how the final peace deal looks here, Ukraine may eventually be built as a direct competitor to Russia. There are oil fields in the east and west of the country and LNG fields off the coast.

They just say Putin's description, or claim or fear is baseless.
&gt;In his attempts to justify the invasion of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin has made numerous wild claims of a “genocide” committed by the Ukrainian authorities against the population of Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine.

It is very clear that the US can't do much more. I've seen the sentiment shift toward ""the us is betraying us"" in a lot of the social media out of Ukraine. While this is all unity now, it's not going to last much longer. I would not be shocked if his own people tried to kill him as this drags on. I know how everyone wants this to end, but I think that is unlikely to happen. War is ugly. 

Furthermore,  I have no idea where this claim that Russia expected to take Kyiv in three days comes from. General Millie said something to that effect, but the battle plan the Ukrainians captured showed Russia expected the first phase of this invasion to take 15 days. They are likely a few days behind, but their advance continues.  One of the issues here is most western analysts know nothing about Russian military doctrine.  It is Russian practice that if they encounter resistance, they will exit the city, encircle it, and bombard it with heavy artillery and their MLRS. After that, they take their tanks to the center and radiate outward. That's what they are doing. Americans don't do that, so they have no idea what it looks like. As for the convoy,  it stopped 30KM from kyiv. This makes sense. The Russians established a forward operating base. Their tanks and MLRS systems have a range of 20 to 25KM. There is a paper called the Russian Way of War that explains this stuff. The Russians are operating at max range for their equipment. I expect this would take longer than three days. This is about attrition at this point, and it will be nasty. 

I know the US wants to ban Russian oil imports,  but I noticed we won't touch uranium imports.  We can't without screwing about 10% of our electricity production.  We don't import much oil from Russia anyway, so it doesn't mean much. Germany and Hungary came out today and said they won't support energy sanctions. Poland likely won't do a plane swap because they are worried about getting smoke from Russia. At this point, the US seems to be running out of leverage.  Not to mention that most of the countries outside of the US and EU refuse to sanction Russia. In the long term,  Russia may get what it wants out of this. I suspect they will take the donbas. Crimea is just gone. They will demand a neutral Ukraine with no NATO weapon systems.",f65d1291701825bf31cd527261febb513cfc91af,True,False,,,,,0,1646681748,,0,{},hzqpycw,False,t3_t8v8wz,False,True,t1_hzqj97t,/r/geopolitics/comments/t8v8wz/top_russian_ukrainian_diplomats_to_meet_thursday/hzqpycw/,1646681766,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646652948.0

disclaimer: i am in no way an expert on these matters.  these are just the opinions of someone that has been somewhat keeping updated on this situation in the last month and has some understanding of Putin's personality type and leadership style.

i think Putin needs to believe that the world saw this as a win too tho.  otherwise, they would know he's weak as well.  he doesn't feel comfortable unless he believes that he has power over his perceived enemies.  in his case, that's typically in one of the two following conditions: 1) his enemies see him as a friend or neutral, having enough of their trust to not worry about them intervening or worrying about him, so he can gain more power and eventually back stab them when needed, or 2) he's intimidating them to prevent them from behaving in a way that reduces his power and even give him more.  he definitely doesn't have option 1.  he still has some of option 2 with nukes, but that only works while he doesn't use them.  

if he uses nukes, it uses up option 2.  politically speaking, the West's current goal is to avoid Putin's use of nukes since it threatens their survival (ofc, they want to avoid massive damage and death too).  the West will have to eliminate him as a nuclear threat, taking away the last bit of power he has.  for him, it will be a wild hail mary that will almost certainly backfire unless he can use them so strategically, that it renders the West incapable of eliminating him.  seeing how his govt has been performing recently, it's quite unlikely that they are capable of even developing such an effective strategy.

i see Putin as a case of The Emperor's New Clothes/The Emperor Has No Clothes, except he played both the part of the emperor and the swindling weavers.  He started to believe his own trickery.  In other words, [congrats to Putin](https://i.imgur.com/WSG382p.jpg).",fd344dd9793de0baf72cc3bd228acd8d692ec172,True,False,,,,,0,1646675746,,0,{},hzqaamo,False,t3_t8o9og,False,True,t1_hzpx3xe,/r/geopolitics/comments/t8o9og/this_war_will_be_a_total_failure_fsb/hzqaamo/,1646675764,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646646946.0

[],False,,Cenodoxus,,,[],,,,text,t2_5ahxa,False,True,"&gt;This may be a very unpopular opinion around these parts, but by now clearly Ukraine is fighting a lost war. No support from NATO, no support from any country besides a couple of javelins and promises of soviet fighter planes.

Ukraine is definitely getting a lot of support, and has been for some time. [This thread from a former State Department official](https://twitter.com/maxbergmann/status/1500634443232563203) illustrates how much the U.S. has poured into Ukraine since 2014. The end result was a force custom-built to wreck a Russian invasion.

**Re: the outcome of this war, I'm not so sure.** Earlier I was convinced that Russia would eventually prevail through sheer attrition (and, let's be frank, its willingness to engage in a wildly indiscriminate and inhumane bombing campaign), but after Peskov's statement today, I'm really starting to wonder. Both the U.K. Ministry of Defence and the Pentagon see Russia's gains over the last 3-4 days as minimal at best, and [the latter sees no imminent amphibious invasion of Odessa](https://twitter.com/DanLamothe/status/1500599461202083844) as of last night. Russia's advance from the south has always been better-equipped and supported than it was anywhere else, courtesy of its pre-existing occupation of Crimea, but even that's not yielding the results they clearly need.

Now, that would be one thing in a vacuum. Has Russia stalled because it can't support its forward positions, or are they just attempting to consolidate their forces for a more serious push into the big cities? Both are likely true to varying degrees in different regions. The Russians still have the advantage, especially if they double down on the brutality, which they're clearly willing to do, and/or engineer a false-flag operation with chemical weapons or a nuke (which their propaganda is laying track for now).

**But Peskov's statement today reads like Russia is setting up an *embarrassingly* minimal win condition: Everything just goes back to the way it was, albeit with a few more signatures on papers.** Donetsk and Luhansk will be puppet states (which they already were). Crimea will be Russian (status quo ante). Ukraine pinky-swears that it'll totally never be in the EU or NATO, honest. (Sure, Jan.) If that's the case, Putin's just spent an irrecoverable amount of blood and treasure to get what he already had, while leaving Russia worse off in almost every possible respect.

**There are still thousands of unknown factors and potential outcomes here, but the window of outcomes is narrowing.** All of the truly good possibilities for Russia have now vanished (and were arguably impossible ~48-72 hours into the invasion anyway). Maybe, with great effort and an indefensible bombing campaign, they level Ukrainian cities and plant their flags on the ruins, but there's no possibility of returning to a world where anyone trusts Russia's intentions or is instantly willing to accommodate Russian demands. Previously neutral European states are now printing off NATO applications. Belarus is more unstable and its opposition is energized. Russia's military is clearly worm-eaten by corruption, and Ukraine has demonstrated how to beat (or at least stymie) it. Western-built weapons and training are revealed to be *great* value for the money, and the West can pour weapons and materials into Ukraine much faster than Russia can replace its own. 

Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but Peskov's statement suggests that the Kremlin is worried. Which is terrifying in its own way, because their desperation could go down any number of dark paths (Russian claims that NATO smuggled nuclear material into Ukraine, and that Ukraine is building chemical weapons in Lviv, are insultingly stupid, but revelatory), but these aren't the words of a state that knows it's holding a winning hand.

1. Spread by Bellingcat.

3. ""Global famine"" sensationalism. Media clickbait 101.
4. FSB agent knowing this much about the military situation, including communications between HQ and commanders in the field. Not impossible, but unlikely. 
5. Probably 10,000 soldiers *killed* is a very high estimate, yet the author names it as the most likely. 
6. Referencing Sarajevo and cities holding out for years. This is just for morale purposes, everyone knows that siege was the exception not the rule. The chance of any Ukrainian city holding out for more than 2 months under siege approaches 0. 
7. ""We leave and Assad will be toppled"" is a line that would have been appropriate years ago. The only force that could topple Assad now is Turkey. 
8. The claim that there is a real possibility of nuclear first strike against Ukraine. And even more, saying that such a weapon wouldn't help the military situation. These are both absurdities. 
9. The claim that Turkey closing the straits prevents Russia from supplying anything to Syria by sea. What the author leaves unmentioned is that the straits are blocked only for *warships.* Once again, morale purposes. 
10. ""We are already in total mobilization mode... Governance always goes astray in mobilisation."" Both of these statements are false by any meaning of the word ""mobilization"".
11. Finally, doubting the maintenance of Russian nuclear systems.

Ukraine won't be able to push the Russians back to the border. They are holding up, but it's not like they can prepare a offensive towards Donetsk and the Donbass. The best they can do is get a stalemate and hope someone set a coup on Putin and negotiate peace in good faith. Otherwise, without exit ramps, Russia have very little to lose (unless China gets bothered, and my guess is that they're OK unless there's a risk of nuclear war). We are starting to see the preliminary results of civil bombing and things are only starting to heat up. The West will be enraged to see Kiev leveled, but where's the space to increase sanctions even more? Beyond current sanctions, the US have basically only two ways of making this more costly to Russia: a full-on embargo, akin to Cuba, which would be followed by a global crisis, with China and Latin American being obligated to take sides and potentially starting Cold War II; or getting NATO to join the conflict and praying that you can neutralize Russian nukes before the world gets shattered. I seriously doubt the West will go for either, so this is basically a staring game, where Ukraine wants to resist until Putin goes down and Russia wants the Donbass and is screaming beyond Polish border ""Is this the best you can do?"".

My idea for a peace deal is still the same: give up the Donbass states, set a treaty that forbade them to formally join the Russian Federation for 20 years or so, make the a demilitarized state, create a DMZ on both sides of the border; Ukraine accepts the no-NATO article in their constitution but is allowed to join the EU (which isn't a ""security threat"" like NATO, but it can work as a lesser deterrence); set a joint-venture to explore the Azov reserves; sets a ""good boy"" plan to drop sanctions within goals towards peace. It is *a little* humiliating for Russia, Ukraine doesn't get the Donbass back, but it is the closest of a tie that I can think. Other than that, we can just wait for Russia to shutdown (they have China, Africa and Latin America to do commerce) and Kiev to be leveled to the ground.",f511947191ef9b7dd68fdf6d2fb27ef9d63591f7,True,False,,,,,0,1646668888,,0,{},hzpsswv,False,t3_t8o9og,False,True,t1_hzpoc5u,/r/geopolitics/comments/t8o9og/this_war_will_be_a_total_failure_fsb/hzpsswv/,1646668903,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646640088.0

Kremlin demands Ukraine recognise Crimea as Russian
Russia has said that it can stop operations at ""any moment"" if Ukraine meets Russian conditions.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov says Ukraine must recognise Crimea as Russian, and Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states.

In addition to this, Peskov says Ukraine must amend its constitution and reject claims to enter any bloc (like Nato, for example).

He adds that Russia will finish the ""demilitarisation"" of Ukraine, and if these conditions are met Russian military action will ""stop in a moment"".

The Kremlin spokesman insists that Russia is not seeking to make any further territorial claims on Ukraine.

Russia seized and annexed Crimea in March 2014, and weeks later threw its support behind pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions.""",c3f63f4c8183f77d1b9691e0b6d66692227e45a3,True,False,,,,,0,1646663358,,0,{},hzpfzxg,False,t3_t8o9og,False,True,t1_hzpd9qg,/r/geopolitics/comments/t8o9og/this_war_will_be_a_total_failure_fsb/hzpfzxg/,1646663369,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646634558.0

That being said, I had the same impression as that guy. As if we were getting to a point when such behaviors were frowned upon, and that we lost that and went backward. Like all the examples you mentioned were denounced, people would fight back against it more. I don't know, maybe it's just my own bubble

I guess there are multiple factors for that impression :

* With the USSR crumbling, there was a bit of time when there wasn't anything really threatening the West. As fear/anger (almost a flight or fight response) are the primary drive of such behaviors, it would explain it. At least, until 9/11 and terrorism in Europe (which kinda calmed down after a while). 
* The internet. Old media was definitely more controlled, but the internet unleashed a lot of stuff and it was basically the wild west. So a certain generation enjoyed an era of pretty much unrestricted free speech, which is now slowly changing with the solidification of big companies like Google/Twitter etc, and also regulations. 
* A certain passing of the torch of who's doing the canceling. It used to be old Christian conservative doing the bulk of the moral outrage, wasn't it? Now they are more on the receiving end.

[],False,,EulsYesterday,,,[],,,,text,t2_10rmn0,False,False,"&gt;Well they had better be quite desirable considering how much of a clown show the last 10 days have been. Unless Ukraine somehow kept the fountain of youth hidden to everyone but Putin the self-inflicted damage to the Russian economy alone is absurd. Russia looks week, incompetent, and out of touch, hemorrhaging what little soft power they once had and becoming increasingly reliant on the pariah-state deadman's switch of nuclear arms to back up poor ability to exert hard power as well.

Quite a lot to unpack. The economic damage is indeed very strong. We don't know whether Russia expected it (they must have expected tough sanctions, that much is clear) or if they are surprised by their magnitude, but by all means, it doesn't change the fact Russia is hurting and will be for the foreseeable future. 

That being said, I disagree with the idea that Russia looks weak, incompetent or out of touch, although that is certainly a popular, if romantic, narrative. Russia is winning the war, no matter how you spin what's going on. 

&gt;And who is he going to get these concessions out of? Zelensky? Good luck. 

Why not? Zelensky isn't an irrational warmonger. At some point the situation will be so dire that he will have to make a choice, either leave the country and try to act as some kind of government-in-exile, meaning no real power and years of bloody insurgency, or accept the Russian deal. Russia may even sweeten the deal for him through various means.

&gt;Then he gets to try installing a corrupt puppet government in hostile territory.

Possible, but Russia may simply wait a few months and then let Ukraine elect a new president. He might not even need to rig the elections - after all, they didn't need to rig the Georgian elections in 2012. Then Ukraine will have a de facto government - not recognized by the West of course, but as time passes, Zelensky would become little more than Guaido, ie a half-remembered public figure the West will be willing to sacrifice for normalization at some point.

&gt;Like three other countries have already began pulling themselves further into NATO and the EU.

Who, Finland and Sweden? They're already in the EU. Sure, Russia will not be happy if Finland was to join NATO (Sweden is probably a less aggrieving affair) and will likely try to interfere, albeit not like in Ukraine, but it's a very different matter altogether.

&gt;They'd better be willing to sacrifice much, because they're going to be paying for this for a long time. Sanctions aren't going anywhere, and I don't think their prolonged hostile occupation is going to go so well for them either

Probably, but then I'm not even sure if this will truly be the case. I will mostly depend on the peace deal in my opinion, if Russia manages to get Zelensky to sign on it and doesn't carve more territory out of Ukraine (outside of the breakaways which have essentially been carved out 8 years ago), my guess is that the Western Europe will quite soon find the sanctions an unpleasant and costly business.",dca6c9a055adde3d7c7eb64677078275417a2ab8,True,False,,,,,0,1646645850,,0,{},hzop6zd,False,t3_t0cgvt,False,True,t1_hzompwd,/r/geopolitics/comments/t0cgvt/ukraine_megathread_all_new_posts_go_here_so_long/hzop6zd/,1646645866,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646617050.0

&gt;As none of us are privy to Russian exact goals, we can only guess some possible outcomes desirable for Russia.

Well they had better be quite desirable considering how much of a clown show the last 10 days have been. Unless Ukraine somehow kept the fountain of youth hidden to everyone but Putin the self-inflicted damage to the Russian economy alone is absurd. Russia looks week, incompetent, and out of touch, hemorrhaging  what little soft power they once had and becoming increasingly reliant on the pariah-state deadman's switch of nuclear arms to back up poor ability to exert hard power as well.

&gt;In my opinion the most preferred one would be along these lines: Ukraine recognizes Crimea as Russian, the breakaway republics as independent, becomes a federation with a weak central state, accepts some military restriction and enshrines neutrality in its constitution. Russia can then leave most of Ukraine and avoid fighting whatever insurgency the Ukrainians are willing to fight.

And who is he going to get these concessions out of? Zelensky? Good luck. Failing that, what. Is Putin going to martyr the current president and write a folk hero rebellion mythos against himself? I can think of no greater way to ensure the sanctions come fast and hard. Then he gets to try installing a corrupt puppet government in hostile territory. 

Keep in mind, he hasn't even won the war yet. Given how poorly the Russians are doing at taking the country, I don't think they are going to (theoretically) excel at keeping it; whatever sham government Putin sets up is going to be bled by a million tiny cuts. What exactly is the plan once they can no longer gun down civilians or bomb hospitals, which is starting seem like the only thing the Russian military can do with any semblance of competence? Terror campaigns don't work so hot when *you're* the government.

&gt;What Russia will have gained is essentially thwarting NATO expansion 

Like three other countries have already began pulling themselves further into NATO and the EU. A childish tantrum and power grab against one nation that sees multiple forcibly throw themselves out of your reach. Again, I am very skeptical that Putin has some kind of unseen master goal here. But even if he did, it would need to be incredibly valuable.

&gt;and put Ukraine back in its orbit, a goal they seem willing to sacrifice much for.

They'd better be willing to sacrifice much, because they're going to be paying for this for a long time.

Right, but if you're China, do you *really* trust Russia as a partner in the medium and long term? It's really an alliance of convenience and there are still conflicting strategic interests. In the short term, sure, you're aligned against the West/ the US, but I'd be skeptical about the medium term onwards.

Plus you have to consider the value of oil as a commodity when making these contracts -- if the value of oil plummets (e.g. some renewable energy breakthrough like in batteries, or maybe a new pandemic that again halts the global economy), then the value could again drop 5-10-fold.

[],False,,chef_dewhite,,,[],,,,text,t2_nbzoz,False,False,"I have ties to Taiwan, and a lot of my friends have recently asked me if I am worried that China is now going to invade Taiwan after Russia invaded Ukraine.  I tell them what I think - I do not see an immediate threat of invasion to Taiwan. The Taiwan situation is markedly very different than Ukraine both in terms of the geopolitics as well that long term objectives.  

But not to get complacent though.  I do not deny that is China positioned and closer to a possible invasion of Taiwan than before. I just don't believe its going to happen in the near future.  One thing that China has that Russia does not is they have time, they are the 2nd Largest GDP in the world and a rising power and their military is only set to get stronger and better.  They continue to play the long game. Russia on the other hand is a declining power and smaller player on the global stage, this is why some think Putin invaded now, because Ukraine will eventually become part of NATO and the EU.

China continues to isolate Taiwan at the international level and its easy for them because Taiwan is not a member of the UN. China has been successful in keeping up the narrative that Taiwan is part of China and that is is an internal issue.  And the West went along with this, at least the status quo, because they wanted access to Chinese Markets. But if China invaded Taiwan I think most of the world would sadly view it as an internal issue.  Ukraine is different, Russia invaded a sovereign country - the world knows that, seems like only folks in Russia think differently.  While I think there would be economic sanctions in response to a Chinese invasion, I do not for one moment believe that sanctions would be at the level as they are against Russia for their action.  Russian sanctions hurt western economies, if those same sanctions were applied to China, economies around the world would collapse.

I think China is a learning from the Ukrainian invasion, calculating, watching the world's reaction.  It only helps them prepare better should they ever decide to take Taiwan by force.",8828f958e2da09ddbb5239076d4ad9ecd4390c77,True,False,,,,,0,1646638302,,0,{},hzog0i3,False,t3_t6xnna,False,True,t1_hzo0bwq,/r/geopolitics/comments/t6xnna/crisis_danger_and_opportunity_chinas_geopolitical/hzog0i3/,1646638314,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646609502.0

The attacks doomed China's relations with the EU. The Belt and Road's main objective was to build an economic corridor from China to Europe. 

Secondly, it is now more likely the EU will side with the US in restricting tech imports to China. 

What she gains from Russia is nothing compared to losing the EU. As long as the EU remains neutral, she still has a chance against the US.

Reporters in the WSJ who have connections with officials in Beijing, among insiders in Beijing the invasion put China in a bind. Getting a weakened Russia is not comparable to continued EU neutrality.

The EU is the largest investor in ASEAN, China's so-called backward. it's 30% larger than China's investment in the region.

The Chinese can't take on a united West. In the short run, US attention is diverted to Europe, but in the long run, all that large boast in European military spending has to go somewhere. 

At the end of this conflict, the Russian military will be a shell of its former self.   Germany has doubled its annual military spending. How much of it is needed to defend against a weakened Russia?  Then you factor in Poland's increased spending to 3% of GDP.

In addition, while the Biden administration has had a questionable track record, one undoubtedly success has been the revitalization of the U.S. aligned military structure in the Indo-Pacific, through AUKUS, yes, but perhaps more importantly, succeeding significantly drawing in Japan to prepare and commit to some sort of defense of Taiwan.  

D. China knows doing what Russia would doing would severely endanger its continued economic growth and relationship with the West (even with a hedge of their dual circulation policies). Simply put, China isn’t ready economically or militarily to challenge the current world order. 

The likeliest scenario for Mainland aggression against Taiwan would be slow, line-pushing measures like annexing Taiwan’s outer lying islands or imposing blockades on Taiwan to test Taiwanese and American resolve, rather than going for some sort of rapid fait acompli like Russia apparently attempted in Ukraine.",5d95a7ab73ef5fdc1b9a3dbac7b819b7df1db7e2,True,False,,,,,0,1646627605,,0,{},hznzs0p,False,t3_t6xnna,False,True,t1_hzjb812,/r/geopolitics/comments/t6xnna/crisis_danger_and_opportunity_chinas_geopolitical/hznzs0p/,1646627620,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646598805.0

[],False,,takatu_topi,,,[],,,,text,t2_35ky5dqo,False,False,"As the Russian economy faces severe turbulence and risks, I have a relevant theory as to why Russia launched the war in Ukraine now, as opposed to launching it earlier or waiting a few years.

Russia has strategic motivations for attacking Ukraine: prevent Ukraine from ever joining NATO and serving as a large US-friendly outpost right on Russia's borders. Russia wants a friendly, or at worst, officially neutral Ukraine. It is somewhat similar to the motivations that led to the blockade, Bay of Pigs invasion, and threatened full-scale US attacks on Cuba in 1962 after Havana become pro-Soviet.

The question is, why is Russia attacking now? Moscow has had strategic worries about Ukraine becoming a US ally for decades. Why not attack five years ago? Why not wait until three years from now?

I suspect the answer is rooted in recent macroeconomic trends.

Even prior to the war in Ukraine, US/EU governments were facing the highest inflation in at least four decades, the highest debt-to-GDP ratios since WW2, and they had the lowest interest rates essentially ever. Prices of consumer and staple goods were already rising rapidly.

Meanwhile, Russia is

first in natural gas exports

first in wheat exports

3rd in gold production

fourth in silver production

second in oil exports

third in coal exports

second in sawn wood exports

Yes, the overall Russian GDP is fairly small in nominal terms, but they have enormous influence in crucial markets of raw materials.

That's exactly why Putin attacked at this time - he either figured ""the West couldn't possibly be brash enough to cut off trade with Russia now"" or ""if they sanction us to hell, we can drag them down with us.""",928549645bf9362474401ddf8e2599ad73c3543b,True,False,,,,,0,1646619182,,0,{},hzniur8,False,t3_t884dq,False,True,t3_t884dq,/r/geopolitics/comments/t884dq/scrambling_to_avert_russian_default_putin_allows/hzniur8/,1646619197,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646590382.0

What Xi Gains—and Loses—From Backing Putin  
Chinese strategists view Russia, the United States, and Europe as the most important determinants of the global balance of power. They have long seen Europe’s dreams of a multipolar world as aligned with their own. By cementing the split between Russia and Europe, a Russian invasion of Ukraine would thus risk dividing the most important powers into two blocs—Russia and China on one side and the United States and Europe on the other—re-creating the Cold War security arrangements that China claims to vehemently oppose. Making matters worse, China would be aligned with the weakest of the three other powers.

[],False,,Ducktruck_OG,,,[],,,,text,t2_i74qj,False,False,"The ability to trade freely with all other nations of the world is a privilege, not a right. Withholding the privilege to trade is not the same thing as threatening violence in exchange for demands. Russia chose to invade Ukraine, and as long as the Russians continue to invade, pillage, murder, and destroy the Ukrainians; they do this knowing that it will cost them their access to global trade. 

We have to sanction them because otherwise we are complicit in the conflict. 

Keep in mind that sanctions are not arbitrarily enacted on countries of the world. Sanctions have less to do with hurting the Russia than it is to show solidarity with our allies and global trade partners that we do not endorse imperialistic behavior. The only way sanctions fail is if we go back to trading with Russia without securing Ukrainian sovereignty. 

If these nations manage to persist in the face of sanctions, like North Korea or Iran, that is not indicative of a failure of sanctions. Some nations prefer their own selfish ambitions over access to global trade.

We have numerous defensive treaties in place around the world that detail exactly what conditions the U.S., NATO, and other alliances will get militarily involved in foreign nations, and it's important that we behave in accordance with these treaties. This is the basis of building trust and maintaining global relations. Unfortunately there are not any lines Russia can cross in Ukraine that would force us to react militarily to any existing treaty. 

Everything is in Putin's hand now. If the Russian people disagree with his actions sufficiently to warrant a coup or a revolution, then it will be his fault, not the fault of sanctions. Otherwise we have to assume that enough Russians are complicit with this invasion to a degree that our best course of action is to isolate the country as much as we can.
