[],False,,TikiTDO,,,,,,"&gt; Russia is doing fine and Europe is in a crisis.

Is it? Store are closing down. The malls are empty. Anyone who can is leaving. The only reason money isn't actively being removed from the country is that it's literally illegal to do so right now. A lot of industrial capacity is operating on leftover parts. Significant part of the civilian air transport sector can not get replacement parts. Even their military sector is limited when it comes to new microchips.

Russia is far from ""fine."" It just didn't collapse entirely within the first few months of sanctions. But that's sorta the thing with sanctions. They're tend to start hurting more the longer they last.

Unless your contention is that Russia is wholly self sufficient in all technologies, industries, and fields, then there's no way that ""fine"" is anywhere close to describing Russia's problems.

Also, the reason Europe is in crisis is because it had created more short term dependence on Russia. Fortunately this event has put a spotlight on that particular problem. The net result is that Europe is now reducing dependence on Russian gas, which is another factor that hurts Russian long term chances. Even if this was over tomorrow, Russia's days of pumping unlimited amounts of gas and oil to Europe appear to be dwindling, along with the income streams those offered. Worse yet, Russia doesn't really have much else to offer the export market. The best they can say is that they are self sufficient, which definitely doesn't smell like ci

The only way this works out for Russia is if we do as you say, and back off, lift all the sanctions, and return to same as usual.

&gt; Military aid has not worked. Maybe it's slowed the roll, but Ukraine's situation continues to only get bleaker.

Both sides are slowly bleeding personnel, while fighting for a few square kilometers of territory. Given that at the start of the war most of the world was convinced Ukraine would last a few days it's hard to call the current situation ""bleaker."" 

The reality is that a small country with a military budget a fraction of Russia's has managed to make Russia back of from multiple fronts, and is now making them invest insane amounts of personnel and equipment for minute gains.

The only way you can make the claim that military aid has not worked is by pointing out that Russia has not been defeated. However, avoiding defeat is a long way from victory.

&gt; You might project that will change, for some reason. But Russia bet against the West and so far they've been proven right to do so-- and the West deeply underestimated the importance and robustness of Russia's economy.

Russia's bet against the west was that it would be able to walk into Ukraine, take over the entire country in a few days, and then give the west the finger. All that's left of that bet is ""and then give the west the finger,"" while trying emergency measures to prevent it's total economic collapse as it gets more and more mired in what looks like it will be a long and costly war. I mean, how did you manage forget that Russia's literally failed to accomplish most of their original stated goals, and are now on phase 3 or 4 or walking back their intentions. 

So again, your only point seems to be ""the Russian economy has not collapsed after 3 months of war."" It just largely shut down, while preventing people from moving money out of the country.",a775e934d394bb32091417c88c1e816138e407bb,True,False,,,,,0,1653607779,,0,{},ia4ne21,False,t3_uydujl,False,True,t1_ia3tm2c,/r/geopolitics/comments/uydujl/what_putin_got_wrong_about_ukraine_russia_and_the/ia4ne21/,1653607794,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1653578979.0,[],text,t2_3yp3u,False,False,

They couldnt even make it 3km into Vietnam without their supply chain being completely destroyed by their own incompetence. The fact is war is complicated, and the PLA/PLAN are disorganised and messy. The PLA/PLAN commit ~40% of their time to learning ""communist thought"" rather than actually learning how to win wars. Its almost funny how incompetent they are.

I think you hold very old and dated views. I also believe that your view derives from the current Russian-Ukrainian conflict, because you think that just because Russia isn't performing as well as everybody thought somehow means in any Chinese conflict with Taiwan would be a similar outcome.

To offer some contrary points, as someone living in St Petersburg:

Talent, innovation, and tech companies have been fleeing Russia as fast as their new countries' registration processes can manage. Those that aren't are seriously suffering the effects of sanctions on banks. One tech company I teach has already laid off half its staff after losing a lot of their international business. That FSB stat floating around a few weeks ago shows that even by internal Russian numbers, as many as 4 million Russians left the country since the outbreak of war. Maybe you think that this is somehow not a negative thing for Russia's economy at all, but for a country already in the throes of serious demographic decline, that is a very big effect that sanctions have had already. 

Inflation could rise in Russia by as much as 20%. Even with conservative estimates, a 10% rise is still a lot. Supermarket goods are beginning to see the clinch. My pack of 100 teabags was 299 roubles at the start of the year, and its 500 now. A 300 rouble pint of beer in January at our local is now 450. Women's health products have jumped in price significantly. All the major fashion outlets pulling out means people don't even have anywhere to buy decent clothes anymore. Back to boutiques and markets basically. 

My wife is an academic in economics and public administration and so has a fairly good grasp on how the government works, and she is quite unambiguous in describing the Kremlin's moves as band-aids that will make everything look good on paper for now, but will seriously wreck long term stability and prosperity. Russia could very soon be forced into defaulting. These are all the effects on sanctions. We're starting to feel it here. There is no good future for this country.

Perceptions of the decline of the west have been greatly exaggerated.

While it was true to a degree, since Putin got away with Georgia and Crimea, it is also clearly the case that the west can actually unite and respond.  

Not only is the west capable of this, but it still controls all the meaningful global institutions.  Finance and currency, diplomacy, technology, and militarily, there really is no other center of power than the west.  The fact that they have largely been sitting on this power was mistaken for weakness.

&gt;Something that was expected to take a very short period like 2014 

Crimea did not fight back, and the Russian troops were already in Crimea under the Kharkov pact. Donbas was a revolution and there was nothing short about it, it's been going on for 8 years.

There was gunfire around Maidan Square in February.  Zelensky later confirmed to Time Magazine that hit squads tried to storm the Presidential Offices and were close to killing him.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Kept away, or never sent? The Russians evidently had little trouble getting large numbers of troops to the city's outskirts, and I see no reason why they shouldn't have been able to get their artillery there if they ever wanted to.

They weren't close enough to the city center.  Ukraine stopped them fairly far away from the center.  And they also didn't have the supply lines to bring in artillery once Ukraine cut those off.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I'm skeptical of claims of Russian troop losses, but even ignoring that, this isn't proof that it wasn't intended as a feint. It could simply be that things didn't go as planned and the Russians were put into a bad situation in which they experienced mroe losses than they originally intended.

Everyone suggests that the troop losses were very high, including independent NATO sources.  Much higher than the US successful invasion of Iraq...  Much, much higher.  You don't sacrifice that many troops in a ""feint.""  Russia could have easily done what it is doing now in the beginning without sacrificing so many troops.  They would have been able to cut off a bigger chunk of Donbas already.

The reason why they didn't is because Putin doesn't want just the Donbas area.  His main anger with Ukraine has always been the successful Maidan protests.  He doesn't like the fact that Ukrainians managed to depose his puppet dictator, Yanukovych, and that they have the audacity to have elections.  What he's doing now is basically still trying to make Ukraine a puppet slave state but he will just strangle Ukraine slowly and wear out its Western support instead before he goes for Kyiv again.",d8b8d1c6a3a54ac44ba0effe52d363767e2e505b,True,False,,,,,0,1653595321,,0,{},ia3vg22,False,t3_t020va,False,True,t1_ia3s2f3,/r/geopolitics/comments/t020va/russia_invasion_of_ukraine_live_thread/ia3vg22/,1653595336,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1653566521.0,[],text,t2_f1tl112,False,False,

The goal won't be to achieve total capitulation - they'll accept the minimal concessions that will allow them to say they've reunified the country before October's Congress.

This is all well and good if the Taiwanese had no naval force whatsoever to speak of in order to defend themselves...which they do, a relatively large one in fact given the size of Taiwan.

&gt;China has used this ""peaceful"" approach on a small scale to achieve area denial around contested atolls and fishing grounds. Unarmed Chinese vessels will physically block the path of foreign ships, or surround them and make their passage impossible.

I do see some major issues with this hypothetical blockade. How are small fishing vessels going to stop large tankers and container ships from just bulldozing their way through into Taiwanese ports? Shoot them? Well, then they wouldn't exactly be ""unarmed"" in that case anymore and would give the legal justification for the Taiwanese navy and coast guard to take action.

And even if they do start shooting supertankers and large cargo ships, all they would have to do to respond is raise the US flag on all of them which would complicate this ""peaceful blockade"" strategy considerably as this would invite the USN to start escorting these ships in and out of Taiwanese waters.

&gt; Later on, during the Korean War, the term ""human wave attack"" to describe the Chinese short attack, a combination of infiltration and shock tactics employed by the People's Volunteer Army (PVA).[27][28] According to some accounts, Marshal Peng Dehuai—the overall commander of the PVA forces in Korea—is said to have invented this tactic.[29]

&gt; A typical Chinese short attack was carried out at night by numerous fireteams on a narrow front against the weakest point in enemy defenses.[28] The PVA assault team would crawl undetected within grenade range, then launch surprise attacks against the defenders in order to breach the defenses by relying on maximum shock and confusion.[28] If the initial shock failed to breach the defenses, additional fireteams would press on behind them and attack the same point until a breach was created.[28] Once penetration was achieved, the bulk of the Chinese forces would move into the enemy rear and attack from behind.[30] During the attacks, the Chinese assault teams would disperse while masking themselves using the terrain, and this made it difficult for UN defenders to target numerous Chinese troops.[31] Attacks by the successive Chinese fireteams were also carefully timed to minimize casualties.[32] Due to primitive communication systems and tight political controls within the Chinese army, short attacks were often repeated indefinitely until either the defenses were penetrated or the attacker's ammunition supply were exhausted, regardless of the chances of success or the human cost.[28]

&gt; This persistent attack pattern left a strong impression on UN forces that fought in Korea, giving birth to the description of ""human wave.""[6] U.S. Army historian Roy Edgar Appleman observed that the term ""human wave"" was later used by journalists and military officials to convey the image that the American soldiers were assaulted by overwhelming numbers of Chinese on a broad front.[1] **S.L.A. Marshall also commented that the word ""mass"" was indiscriminately used by the media to describe Chinese infantry tactics, and it is rare for the Chinese to actually use densely concentrated infantry formations to absorb enemy firepower.**[33] In response to the media's stereotype of Chinese assault troops deployed in vast ""human seas"", a joke circulated among the US servicemen was ""How many hordes are there in a Chinese platoon?""[6][28][34]

&gt; In Chinese sources, this tactic is referred to as ""three-three fireteams,"" after the composition of the attack: three men would form one fireteam, and three fireteams one squad. A Chinese platoon, consisting of 50 men, would form three ranks of such fireteams, which would be employed to attack ""one point"" from ""two sides.""[35]",d8c915249424cceeca505ed43bb94dd9aa3ab92c,True,False,,,,,0,1653584826,,0,{},ia35ptc,False,t3_uxfpht,False,True,t1_ia16m7l,/r/geopolitics/comments/uxfpht/china_follows_biden_remarks_by_announcing_taiwan/ia35ptc/,1653584842,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1653556026.0,[],text,t2_ebr4s,False,False,

Food exports are more complicated because in a globalized world lots of countries import a lot - China does too.

The trick here is that it relies on fertilizer that is imported and produced from hydrocarbons. But there is a certain massive nuclear armed nation to its north, which the west has declared proxy war on, which produces all of these materials in massive quantities and can export them at massive quantities too. And china still produces a massive amount of food and energy. They have a lot of dirty (in both extraction and GHG) coal they can produce in war time which allows them more slack in energy production. And much of Chinese energy use is for exporting goods - they won't be doing much of that in a war.

1. Semiconductor industry. China is never going to get Taiwan's semiconductor industry by force. The facilities will be destroyed before any invasion. The only hope for China is to infiltrate Taiwanese structures of power to make it more aligned with mainland China with the hope that reunification will be seen as something positive one day. Education is key in this aspect and China has never been afraid of playing the long game. 
2. Returning to past maps. This one is self-explanatory and the most stupid one I could think of. I just don't know what to say about it. Historical aspirations feel kind of empty in the face of reality.
3. Strategic importance of Taiwan's location. This is probably the main one, and it scares me to be honest. It scares me because it means in this day and age, world powers are still operating within the basis of possible wars. And a modern world war is not something that would end well. China could choose to change it stance on Taiwan, become friendly and make it an ally in some decades, but they choose the violent option.

I have to say regarding 3, that while trying to be impartial, I find the US way of dealing with these issues better. They created OTAN, a coalition of countries that **want** to be in that coalition, and that gives the United States an incredible strategic advatadge (US bases in Japan, Germany, the Bosphorus strait thanks to Turkey) without needing to invade or threaten people. 

I am not naive, I understand that the US pressures many countries to do its bidding using the so-called ""soft power"". But I still think it's a better alternative to open threats and war.

In that sense, I find the Chinese Belt and Road initiative a continuation of that soft power that is more favoured nowadays, and I think that's the way to go. In an ideal world everyone would keep to themselves but in reality powerful countries want influence, it has always been like this and it will always be. I am happy that China chooses to exert it via soft power, but it worries me that there so much talk about open conflict with Taiwan.",ee3b29900c5e96d66cf11d34aa2ae13b66014836,True,False,,,,,0,1653553641,,0,{},ia1j6a1,False,t3_t020va,False,True,t1_i9zhazb,/r/geopolitics/comments/t020va/russia_invasion_of_ukraine_live_thread/ia1j6a1/,1653553652,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1653524841.0,[],text,t2_6di1x,False,False,

Your worldview is pretty narrow if you imagine there would be global outrage. The Saudis have said they are done with Biden - they won't answer his calls or increase production to kneecap Russia, and they are embracing China in an increasingly assertive manner. It's not unthinkable that Saudis and Russia would both turn off the taps to Europe if push came to shove. And yes, the US could bomb the hell out of everything, but I think that's the point - to force the US to escalate and in so doing discredit themselves. 

In the Chinese desert they've been building mockups of US aircraft carriers and Aegis destroyers, and targeting them with long range ballistic anti-ship missiles. They're warning the US that they can and will sink a carrier if the US over commits. US carrier group defenses are formidable, but a salvo of hundreds of anti-ship missiles would saturate any defense systems. That's a huge risk to take - losing a carrier would be a massive humiliation. 

The Berlin airlift was possible only because the Western allies has negotiated a right to an air corridor well before the crisis began (something they failed to do for ground and water corridors). While we'd certainly expect to see a similar effort for Taiwan, this would require China to leave some runways intact. These would be a top target the moment Taiwan flies it's first sortie. (Taiwan's fighters are setup to fly from roadways but these aren't likely to be of use to any cargo aircraft).

For too long Western companies have moved production where it was the cheapest, which was impoverished countries. While other countries like China decided the parameters in which their companies can operate, Western countries opted for letting the free market do its thing, and now it shows.

Honestly, I think an eventual solution would be to unify tax rates globally, something the EU is already proposing within the union, and to focus on uplifting poorer countries. With the rise of the Chinese giant, it brought along a robust middle class, which made manufacturing less attractive than in the past. The results are that much of manufacturing capability is being shifted to other developing countries, moslty in the SEA region. 

With the increase of QOL in a country, it becomes less attractive to companies because of the increased operating costs. Finding themselves out of options with lower costs, companies will be much more likely to stay in home soil. 

I acknowledge that this sounds more like wishful thinking than anything else, but globalization is not something you can walk back, but more of an inevitability such as climate change (I am aware the speed at which climate change happens can be regulated). ""The toothpaste is out of the tube"" as they say, and we need to find ways to make this new path a good one.

As a final note I would argue that one of the biggest problems in the US is the defanging of Anti-Trust law, which sees the disappearance of small and medium companies and the rise of not just big companies, but veritable behemots capable of challenging the economic power of sovereign states.

Tens of Millions of people in China are pissed right now over the lockdowns. If the CCP successfully blockades Taiwan, those lockdowns are revealed as a key ploy that made such a feat possible - the West sees the port congestion as Chinese incompetence, but really they're just building up a massive fleet under everyone's noses. It will honestly be brilliant if they pull something like that off, and any doubters of CCP leadership will be discredited.

The reason the USD is the current currency of choice is because the US is one of the only countries willing to run persistent trade deficits. 

As long as China's economy is built on exporting their excess production to other countries they will always have to hold foreign currency rather than other countries holding Yuan. 

To become a reserve currency, China would have to change their entire economic system to become driven more by internal consumption and less by exporting excess production. That would require a massive rebalancing of wealth from the Chinese state to the Chinese consumer, along with a commensurate shift in political power. I don't see that as very likely. 

Sure, China may be able to get certain transactions denominated in Yuan, but ultimately what matters for reserve currency status is what assets your central bank to balance trade.
