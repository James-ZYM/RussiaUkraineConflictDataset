I took her shopping at a Star Market in suburban Boston. Her eyes widened at shelves laden with fresh vegetables and fruit during winter. While our graduate school student life was lean by American standards, it was over-the-top luxury by Soviet standards.

“They lied to us,” she said, angrily. 

“Who?” I asked.

“They,” she said, nodding her head.

“The Kremlin?”

She nodded. On Soviet TV, the U.S. was portrayed as a wasteland of AIDS, homelessness and civil unrest, similar to how it is portrayed today.

Now that moment of self-reflection is forgotten. The sanctions confirm to her what she is being told, which is that the “special military operation” in Ukraine isn’t about a sovereign state defending itself against unprovoked aggression, but instead that Ukraine is a puppet being directed by the evil U.S. If Zhenya, my wife and I can’t convince Maria she is being fed lies then I suspect nothing can.

Maria survived Stalin, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the loss of two children and an alcoholic, abusive husband. I love her, but she is a tragic example of how vulnerable human beings can be to propaganda.

I moved to Russia as a new college graduate in 1991. I was eager to master the language, become a foreign correspondent and better understand our Cold War enemy. What was intended to be a six-month jaunt turned into marriage and children. It also tied me to Maria. 

We speak frequently because my wife loathes Vladimir Putin. She can’t have a conversation with her mother without it shifting into open conflict. Maria treats me with a degree of restraint Russians sometimes afford foreigners. I ask about the weather. Most days Maria is glued to Russian state TV, her exclusive source of information. 

“Kids are dying,” I said. “Russian kids, younger than your grandson.”

“That’s war,” she said, flatly. 

“If 50,000 die, will your opinion change?”

Vesti, Russia’s flagship news program, is full of bizarre claims. Maria isn’t educated and the news is slick. The deeper Russia is submerged in lies, the more Maria lashes out at those who speak the truth—even family. Maria’s older sister, Zhenya, lives in Ukraine

Even the caesar were not supposed to be announced, it was an accidental leak from a parliament members. They have access to this info but everything is strictly classified by the army. Macron and Zelensky agreed on keeping their activities secrets. But they work a lot together, not only on weapons, but on politic approach to gather world’s attention. I’d really like to give you a source, and I guess you won’t trust me. Anyway, I’m proud if our involvement, we don’t care about the bashing. But I would love so much more. My best friend is ukrainian. I have many ukrainian friends, colleagues. Sometimes i get some news. They lack of everything. They see things no one would believe. My best friend Parents are our neighbors now, refugees. We talk sometimes, they are of course very well informed, but they don’t want to give too many details on the bad news. Just enough so we understand that the situation is beyond everything. Butcha is not only a symbol, it’s more an example of what average russian soldiers do all the time, everywhere. Of course, for us, even the idea of a soldier raping a baby is impossible to get. They call that routine.

One day he said thank you for the french help. I was embarrassed, i wish we would do much more. So much more. But again, I am not in the secrets.

The conversation always end with the father saying , looking far away, ‘we will win’. Not like a mantra, or a wish, it’s just obvious. 

I am sometimes ashamed to have huge doubts about that.

And I think many of us here are too confident.

Ukraine is not doing well, I mean there is no word to describe how good fighters they are. But they are exhausted. And they don’t have that many people. And their number of death is very high.

So they need help. More and more. I’m afraid of what is gonna happen if the world get used to this war. And send less money , weapons, love; because they are themselves in a bad situation due to the side effects of the war: energy, food… or maybe it will encourage then to help our ukrainian friends to fight the monster.

Berlin wants to provide the NATO partner with 15 Leopard 2 tanks from industrial stocks and use them to compensate for deliveries of heavy weapons from the Czech Republic to Ukraine. Unlike the Czech Republic, however, Poland insists on modern tanks, the gaps must be filled with the latest German Leopard tanks, anything else would endanger Poland's ability to defend itself, they say.

According to SPIEGEL information , the ring exchange talks between Germany and Poland are hopelessly deadlocked. Last week, Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht had to admit to a confidential group of coalition politicians that she had little hope of reaching an agreement with Warsaw.

The reason: The Bundeswehr itself does not yet have the latest Leopard models, only a small part of the German Panzer Army is currently being upgraded by the industry. As a result, the responsible state secretary from the military department could not make any promises during talks with Poland and had to end the negotiations without success.

It took the US 7 months to secure Guadalcanal.    It took under 3 months to take Okinawa.   It took a year to fully liberate France.  OTOH, it took 3 months from the time they Western Allies crossed the Rhine to Germany's surrender.

Wars aren't steady things proceeding at uniform rate.  And so far Russia has lost about 40% of the territory they've grabbed.  

And the Russians have some advantages in equipment and terrain they can exploit.  But those advantages are being washed away, like tears in the rain, by the Ukrainians.  

For example, they're now bringing in T-62 tanks.  The T-62 wasn't a good tank in the 1960s.  And even upgraded, it's not a good tank now.  I suppose the best thing that can be said about it is that, lacking an auto-loader, their turrets won't be flying through the sky like you see with the T-72s, T-80s &amp; T-90s.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBaxDMrQp-Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBaxDMrQp-Q)

The Russians are also deploying BMP-1s.  Those were great in the 1970s, much better than our 1960s M-113s.  But even upgraded, they're nothing more than glorified metal coffins in the way Russia uses them.

And their manpower is definitely degrading as well.  The VDV, which was 40% of the invasion force, has been decimated.  And it's not just VDV, the 1st Guards have been substantially degraded.  It's routine for units to be at one-third strength.  It's been so bad and that the Russians have suffered such heavy casualties that they've increased the age for soldiers to join the military.  When nations do that, it means they're having problems.

And it's not like Ukraine has not gotten punched. They've taken a lot of blows.  But the fact is they're better and now, in areas, they have better equipment such as the M777 arty, the Javelins, NLAWs, Panzerfaust...

The self-righteousness with which Kirill celebrates his own complicity with Putin’s messianic mission to Make Russia Great Again is truly nauseating.

State and Church in Russia are inextricably bound up together in their delusion that they are a holy nation whose crimes are justified by their chosen status; as Kirill expresses it in this article:

“It was we who broke the back of fascism, which would have conquered the world if not for Russia,” said Patriarch Kirill, flanked by uniformed Russian troops inside the grand building commemorating Russia’s victory over invading Nazi forces in World War II. “God will help us today, too.”

Russia is now the fascist aggressor pretending to be the savior! Outrageous!

As a Russian critic explains the situation In the article:

“Under Patriarch Kirill, the Russian Orthodox Church has become a primary purveyor of the president’s nationalist ideas. Sergey Chapnin, who formerly worked with Patriarch Kirill as the editor of the church’s monthly magazine and is now a critic, said it is as much a part of the regime as state television and major Russian corporations such as oil giant Gazprom.”

“High-ranking priests are “part of the corrupt Putinist elite,” he said. “It’s terrible to see how this union with the state has made the church pliant and amoral.”

205,[],False,,Far_Idea9616,,,[],,,,text,t2_gopcxdy8,False,False,"A more balanced expert opinion from portfolio.hu. The good news is that there are oil types that can be substituted for Russian oil, the bad news is that they may differ significantly from Russian oil in some parameters, so their use requires modifications to Mol's infrastructure, the product export is different, they are more difficult to obtain, more expensive to transport and, not least, they are now much more expensive than Russian REB oil.

For every single oil and blend, hundreds in all, Mol produces a detailed report. There are parameters on the basis of which a particular type must be rejected, because the company's technology cannot handle it. One of the possible alternatives is Arab Light crude, which is very similar to Russian crude, has a slightly higher sulphur content, but is very close to Russian crude in terms of yield structure, so Mol can produce about the same amount of gas oil, petrol and chemical products from it, Zsolt Huff explained to Portfolio. However, there is one parameter, the sulphur content of a particular fraction, which is significantly higher than the permissible value, and this makes it impossible for Mol's diesel production unit to operate. According to László Miklós, the high sulphur content is not an impossible challenge either, one solution could be to grant a concession in the temporary quality standard for the sulphur content of fuels, temporarily putting fuels on the market with sulphur content that complies with the standards that have been in force for 10-20 years, but this would most likely not be necessary either, because in 3-6 months, by changing catalysts and changing the parameters, it would be possible to produce a product quality that complies with the current standard, with a tolerable reduction in production capacity.

Who's paying the cheque?
Alternative types of oil do exist, but they must be available in sufficient quantities and reliably and continuously supplied to Mol's refineries. The Szazhalombatta refinery already processes almost 35 percent marine oil, which requires a marine shipment every two weeks, but if Mol were to process 100 percent non-Russian oil, it would require a ship to dock every two days in Croatia.

The oil that arrives by ship has to be decanted, pumped, the necessary infrastructure has to be expanded, blending and storage capacities have to be built, and some sections of the Adriatic pipeline may also need to be expanded, all of which are in addition to the investments that are needed on the Mol side, such as building blending capacity, creating storage facilities, and converting refineries.

The big question is: whose budget should be burdened by the construction of these peacetime redundant capacities? What should be the share of Mol, the Croatian pipeline operator, JANAF, the Hungarian and Croatian states, or even the European Union? 

How well is Mol doing in the current situation? In a word: very. The Hungarian company is making a lot of money primarily through the widening of the Brent-Ural spread. The Brent-Ural spread is important for Mol because it uses the cheaper Ural crude in its refineries, while its product prices are aligned with the Brent price. The price spread between the two types of oil has typically been in the range of +/- $3 in recent years, with the price of Russian Ural oil typically lower. However, due to the war in Ukraine, Western oil companies have significantly reduced imports of Russian oil, putting pressure on the price of Ural oil, which has been much lower than Brent oil in recent weeks, with the spread between the two currently at $35.

As Mol is currently buying and processing Ural oil, which is much cheaper than Brent, it is making a substantial profit,

THE COMPANY'S REFINERY MARGINS HAVE RISEN TO UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS.

And looking at the overall group result, Mol achieved an unprecedented group EBITDA in the first quarter of this year",8bdf40031a5fa78aec61149375478b52fc8ad447,True,False,,,,,0,1653606292,,0,{},ia4ka4q,False,t3_uxkyyl,False,True,t1_i9zpdkl,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uxkyyl/hungary_can_ditch_russian_oil_in_a_year_energy/ia4ka4q/,1653606308,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653577492.0,

The fuck are you getting at?

&gt;But Januković was legitimately elected.

Yes, and it was when he stabbed the population in the back that they started to protest. Almost like they hated him for a pretty good reason. Without US involvement. 

&gt;USA played with good old custom, as in southern South America, caused the coup, brought his right-wing government and started a civil war against the rebel region that refused to recognize the revolution.

Which of those countries held democratic elections mere months after the revolution?  Which of those countries saw elections bringing about changes in administration within five years?

And again, what the fuck gives Russia the right to invade and fucking **annex** territory over any of this?  ""The us supported autocratic dictators in South America in the 50s-70s, so clearly, Russia gets to annex Ukraine because the US apparently aided in them kicking out a corrupt guy and not installing an autocracy in place""?

Gee.  Uhh. Ok????

&gt;That is a much bigger sin than the annexation of Crimea.

Is Putin any *less* of a supporter of Autocracy?  ""Russia gets to annex Crimea as part of an autocratic dictatorship because the us supported autocracy in South America""???

What kind of asinine argument is this?

&gt;And that is the least that Russia could have done for **its people in Ukraine** and the reputation of a superpower that may have some interest, at least on its border.

The EU is discussing a sixth round of punitive measures, including an embargo on Russian oil imports. Such a move requires unanimity but Hungary opposes the idea for now on the grounds its economy would suffer too much.

""How many more weeks will the European Union try to agree on a sixth package?"" Zelenskiy said in a late night address, noting that Russia was receiving a billion euros a day from the 27-nation bloc for energy supplies.

""Of course I am grateful to those friends who are advocating new sanctions. But where do the people blocking this sixth package get their power from? Why are they allowed to hold such power?"" he asked.

Berlin hopes talks on the new round of sanctions will be completed soon but it will not be a topic at a leaders' summit next week, a German official said on Wednesday.

Zelenskiy's comments mark the second day in a row that he has sharpened his criticism of the world's approach to the war.

""Pressure on Russia is literally a matter of saving lives. And every day of procrastination, weakness, various disputes or proposals to 'pacify' the aggressor at the expense of the victim merely means more Ukrainians being killed,"" he said.

On Wednesday he savaged suggestions that Kyiv make concessions to bring peace, saying the idea smacked of attempts to appease Nazi Germany in 1938.

He also reiterated complaints that the world had so far failed to totally isolate the Russian banking system and was not providing heavy weapons quickly enough.

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation” that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.",1d77c4d71a752b6a451d99d687b7cd8e10e5de42,True,False,,,,,0,1653605000,,0,{},ia4hjt6,True,t3_uyjl5c,False,True,t3_uyjl5c,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uyjl5c/ukraines_zelenskiy_complains_about_eu_divisions/ia4hjt6/,1653605017,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653576200.0,

407,[],False,,squatchy1969,,,[],,,,text,t2_aetinvt,False,False,"Lots of points of contention:

I think you’re confusing Air Dominance with Air Superiority. The US Sec Def briefings have even confirmed Russian air superiority and again, being so close to their border they would be able to bring in massive numbers if they need them. They are already flying hundreds of sorties a day and can increase if they need to, Ukraine can’t come close to matching that. Add in the S400 which is the best AA system in the world and the influx of the newer S500’s and the air around the Donbass will be locked down.

And you’re incorrect about the artillery, Russia has longer range and very accurate pieces. And artillery has always been at the forefront of Russian doctrine so they have lots of them and lots of high quality, especially rocket systems. The Malka 203mm has longer range than the M777’s and they’re tracked with better mobility as an example.

As for tanks, Janes had Russia with ~3600 Frontline MBT’s prior to the war starting and estimates they have lost ~500. Undoubtedly based in part of #’s from the Ukrainian MOD, so those figs must be taken with a large grain of salt. Even if you go with that number, they still have thousands available. Modern tanks lose many of their advantages in CQB, so Russia is most likely using some of their 10,000 tanks in storage to be used in the urban and suburban areas. This is a concession that they know they’ll lose armor so why not use the old stuff to just be a hammer and take down buildings and fortifications at shorter ranges with infantry and drone support. When they move into more open ground the Tier 1&amp;2 tanks will be featured.

The troops thing is just unfounded rumors. Wasn’t Russian going to do a full mobilization of May 9th because they were running out? And if all these guys are refusing or missing, how does Russia keep taking town after town? They’re not having an infantry problem, if they were then you’d see a mobilization. The latest US estimate was that around 85% of the initial forces were still present. Meanwhile ~2500 of Ukraine’s best and irreplaceable troops just surrendered and at least 3 other units have filmed vids saying they won’t continue combat ops. 

Ukraine bringing up more troops, many of which that have never held a gun before and having them attack those positions is suicidal. They would be much better served on Defense in the South.

Look, I’m not trying to be condescending jerk here and I’m not pro Russian by any means. But I am realist and while everyone here was saying “we’re winning!” I was correctly calling it propaganda and that’s why the position swayers have begun to brace everyone for the harsh truth. Kissinger, the NYT etc., are correct in calling for negotiations because the DonBass is just about done and Ukraine needs to stop recklessly sacrificing blood and treasure and better prepare for the next defense. The fantasy of counter attacks with raw, newly trained troops with unfamiliar weapon systems against well entrenched and supported defensive positions is what happens when inmates run the asylum.

I'm not sure that's better or worse than Spain (very much not famous for their efficiency) who built an airport for over a billion euros that ended up closed shortly after opening. It'd seem more wasteful but OTOH the cost overruns of Berlin Brandenburg were many times greater than the entire cost of Ciudad Real..

What's more surprising is the German reputation for being straight-talkers and straight dealers. They started out well - threatening to kill NordStream 2 if Russia attacked and then promptly doing so, but since then their messaging has been very inconsistent and muddled. 

_Maybe_ you could excuse it with that they're having to realign and rethink their entire foreign-policy approach. But even that's not a good excuse since Finland and Sweden's decisions to join NATO is no less of a re-alignment.

&gt; &amp;quot;We expect the impact on the U.S. and the global economy to be minimal, given Russia has already been isolated financially,&amp;quot; White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said in a press briefing on Thursday.

That's a bunch of meaningless nothing.

&gt;Romania has had HIMARS, Patriot Batteries and AEGIS onshore before Poland had them.

So what? I doubt Romania would hand those over without the say so of the US. If the US will decide on delivering those, they will do it themselves.

&gt;Romania has never used pure T-72 or pure soviet tanks ever.

So what? This makes no difference. All those piece-of-shit TR-85 should be offered and sent ASAP if Ukraine would have them. The guns are trash, as are the tanks as a whole, but if they want them, they should get them.

&gt;Transporters are also incompatible, they're not based off BTR-2 or -3s, they use TABs and Scorpions more recently.

Yet again: so what? These are simple vehicles. It's not like the Ukrainians would need to learn the equivalent of brain surgery to operate them. Anybody that ever drove a regular car and is not clinically retarded would probably be able to learn to drive them in a day or so.

&gt;Airforce MIG-21s are being shuttered and replaced with F-35s, not even Ukraine would want them

Here we agree. Those Mig-21s are death traps. If I were the Ukrainians, I wouldn't want to have anything to do with them.

&gt;and F-16s, they don't know how to operate.

This is, again, a US issue. Romania wouldn't transfer them to anywhere without the US' approval. As for the Ukrainians being able to operate them: again, people seem to have a very skewed idea about how difficult/easy it is to operate various devices. The Ukrainian pilots are already trained pilots. It's now like they would be operated by people that never flew before. They would be operated by veteran fighter pilots. And said pilots would need to just learn the differences, which, coming from Mig-29 and Su-27, I would bet money that flying an F-16 wouldn't be very different and, most likely, it would be quite easier.

&gt;Although underreported, Ukraine is RIGHT NOW exporting grains through the Sulina channel up the Danube to the Danube-Black Sea channel, out to Constanta or straight up the Danube, using Romanian shipping channels. Most importantly, +1 mil Ukrainians have found a home in Romania; ask me about it, I've hosted 4 families so far. They find a warm meal and free stay in RO, a country they never knew much about, because of the constant hate between the two countries (see Serpent Island, Bistroe Channel, Bukovina).

All that is nice, but Ukraine now needs weapons and ammo and logistical support equipment more than anything else. Refugee care and grain exports are not going to win battles against the Russians and are not going to drive the Russians out.

Like I said, the US is far from perfect. But it’s also doing a fuck-Ton of good around the world. To just ignore that is bullshit and you know it.

The US is not an evil entity. Does it do evil things sometimes in terms of foreign policy? Yes. As every country does in the name of its self-interests, especially over the course of history. Doesn’t make it right, but doesn’t make the country inherently evil.

Slavery was NEVER right (but I’d like to point out it was NOT unique to the US and in fact originated in Europe).

The support of anti-communist dictators in hindsight was clearly wrong and immoral, but at the time there was a legitimate fear about the spread of influence of the SU and the potential it could lead to an apocalyptic war. Not excusing the results

The treatment of Native Americans was abhorrent, and we now view it rightfully as such.

Russia is having difficulty replacing lost troops… some are deserting, some refusing to fight, and conscripts and contractors are refusing to report. Russia’s initial 190,000 might be 120,000 now. Ukraine’s initial 200,000 now has 300,000 in extensive training, not to mention a beefing up of TDF numbers plus foreign volunteers. And both Romania and Poland have offered to assume repairs to tanks and heavy vehicles, which frees up additional military manpower. And I have a hunch Poland may be handling aircraft maintenance as well. 
So, in another few months not only will Ukraine have the additional arms sent, but also a 4:1 manpower advantage. While Crimea may be too tough a nut to crack in the immediate future, Ukraine will likely have the ability to cut it off from the land bridge, which then makes Russias hold on it tough… everything having to be sent down from Donetsk, while also supplying the eastern front and Izyum front with dwindling logistics and supplies. I don’t think they can do it.",908669b88f370b7fa5c7e950e2d99c67cbb8c20e,True,False,,,,,0,1653600086,,0,{},ia46m0o,False,t3_uycznm,False,True,t1_ia40rhr,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uycznm/in_the_last_week_statements_by_officials_in_kyiv/ia46m0o/,1653600106,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653571286.0,

Russia atlas vassalised Belarus.

If they succeeded in Ukraine they’d have the Ukraine Belarus Russia union state.

They’d then be connected to transnistria.

Moldova is small and corrupt and they’d just use the billions they flooded Ukraine wit for covert ops and influence on Moldova instead.

If soft power wouldn’t work they’d likely find a pretext to topple the Moldovan government the same way and bring it into the fold.

Then they’d have a four country union statue.

After that they could start by formalising annex in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.

This could all have been done within this space of three months easily.

And shortly afterwards they could then play the same covert action then toppling/ invasion with Georgia, giving h the em five countries in the union state.

This would happen so quickly and we’d just be sitting back and watching.

This whole time these types old morons the best they’d be able to offer is blaming each other and worrying short term about gas imports and quibbling over idiotic small short term issues:

By the time they’d want to take action it would be too late.

Putin would truly have what the media would start hyping as a “Soviet Union 2.0”.

We’d see so much repression, he’d have murdered all the free Thinking independent Ukrainians, do the same in Georgia and Moldova or at least chase them into exile.

He’d then start building an army by forcefully conscripting the young people in all these countries and before we know it, China would be throwing their weight behind the new hedge against Europe and we’d be wondering how we can manage this new order.


What would be next?? Putin would start demanding that the Russian majority areas of Estonia, Latvia and Finland be returned to Russia to “right the historical wrong”.

How long would NATO unity last when idiots like this who can’t see the threat would be saying “do it now before they cut off all the gas to us” and they’d be writing letters demanding that others make concessions to spare them any issues.


It’s pure greed, incompetence and short sightedness.

Zelensky’s rhetoric and delivery are flawless in my view!

For words truly has a sacred power to enlighten and educate if only one communicates respectfully with an authentic desire to learn.

Respectful words speaking truth to power is how every one of us can fight for the forces of light and goodness.

Zelenskyy uses the term light for his forces, so I echo it to support him and Ukraine:

“Light will win over darkness.”

President Zelenskyy

It is an open question, if there is also an agreement regarding non-delivery of infantry fighting vehicles (e.g. Marder).

&gt; WASHINGTON, May 26 - As the United States and its allies provide Ukraine with increasingly sophisticated arms, Washington has held discussions with Kyiv about the danger of escalation if it strikes deep inside Russia, U.S. and diplomatic officials tell Reuters.

&gt; The Pentagon&amp;#039;s announcement last week that Denmark will provide Ukraine with Harpoon anti-ship missiles would further extend Kyiv&amp;#039;s reach.

&gt; Democratic Representative Jason Crow, who visited Ukraine in the past month and spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he was not concerned about escalation risk and that Ukraine would use the weapons being provided in the south.

&gt; The Russian Armed Forces apparently blasted Ukrainian positions with thermobaric warheads as Ukraine&amp;#039;s Defense Ministry called on NATO to urgently supply the country with similar weapons.

&gt; Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree Wednesday that makes it easier for Ukrainians in occupied areas to become citizens of Russia.

&gt; The Ukrainian military also claims that Russia has lost 1,315 tanks, 3,235 armored fighting vehicles, 617 artillery systems, 201 multiple launch rocket systems, 93 anti-aircraft systems, 206 warplanes, 170 helicopters, 2,225 motor vehicles and fuel tankers, 13 vessels, 502 unmanned aerial vehicles, 47 units of special equipment, and 114 cruise missiles.

As for Ukraine, they had time to fortify and would be able to give them hell, but most of their mechanized units are focused on Donbas. 1st tank brigade should still be near Chernihiv, but it took some beating during the siege, and at least 2 mechanized brigades should be somewhere west of Kyiv as a reserve.

Your view sounds more evangelical and hollow when you refuse to see Noam Chomsky's double standard and his ideological bias. You have called others narrow-minded in your previous comments so I directed the same to you. You don't expect people to have a discourse with people if you are the one who name calling people. Your reasoning is like,  Noam got arrested by nutjobs like Nixon (  every left leaning academicians were threatened in those days), so that makes him a field-veteran of political activism and SJ, and an expert to run commentary from his arm chair on the independence and will of the people in eastern Europe who revolted  against the Soviet colonialism and got arrested, tortured, deported and killed for doing so. Did he ever participate in any of these movements in any of these countries ? So tell me how is he now so cocksure? How is he claiming that Ukrainians eager to fight for their sovereignty and asking for weapons to resist Putin is just 'western propaganda'? Is it so hard for him to perceive that no post-Soviet country,  in a sane state of mind would ever want to subject itself to becoming a Russian puppet state? Perhaps his 'Putin getting all red because of NATO expansion' is just another propaganda because he fails to see that the eastern European states had every right to join NATO to secure themselves, there wasn't any alternative.  Talking about propaganda: how is he so sure that the separatist movement in the eastern part of Ukraine and Crimea weren't a part of Russian propaganda. Is it like  the 'news clippings' Chomsky gathered to write his theses were the only 'genuine' facts and the rest were just 'manufactured' facts? Perhaps, Putin's vitriolic speeches and his attempt to manufacture consent of common Russians were also a western falsehood.  Plato's cavemen analogy would fit your and Chomsky's view as well. You are blind and biased too, and you see enemies in whoever isn't carrying a hammer and sickle and assume they are secretly tattooing swastika on their back.. ( me being right-winged, an opponent of CRT.. Sweet Jesus, aren't you getting a bit comical here! ). My point is very simple:  the man who wrote theses on atrocities committed by US and allies stays blatantly silent about crimes committed by Russians ( in past and present). And why is that? Questioning this kind of relativist position doesn't make anyone right-winged or left-winged. The thing is when left-winged or right-winged gets too cocksure about their extremist view, they react in the same way. Perhaps it isn't so ironic to have Henry Kissinger, Tucker Carlson and Noam on the same page when it concerns arming Ukrainians even if they have different reasoning and political colours. Their rhetorics or geopolitical speculations have nothing to do with what is good for the common Ukrainians. They were nowhere to be found when the first Euromaiden movement happened, no contempt expressed when Crimea was annexed. What matters is the well planned objective actions of powerful nations around the world to thwart this 'bullying'. Noam tends to victim-blame if the bullied is not in his political shade. In his recent comments he 'seems' to refute  Ukraine's territorial sovereignty, and fail to acknowledge that any separatist movements are internal matters of Ukraine and it didn't require the imperialist Russia to intervene. We are all aware that Ukraine won't be able to keep all it's territory and she will have to compromise at certain point and seek some form of peaceful settlement, but when she will do so is her to decide and no- ones's to dictate.  Stopping arming in the middle of the war would be an act of coercion or betrayal towards Ukrainian and tantamount to letting Putin have whatever he wants and have strategic military advantage. How much a despot like Putin cares about diplomacy and peaceful settlement was seen when he annexed Crimea by sending his green little men.  Russia has been, plain and simple,  acting as a terrorist state ( in every sense Noam used to accuse the US of being the same); and you want us to believe that any peace agreement would be respected by the Russians after what they have done, they will not proceed to systematically detain, deport and kill like what they did to the Tartars and Ukrainians in the past, or proceed further to grab territories of other frontier European states. One simply shouldn't yield to thugs and rapists.

Republicans are making mail-in voting and early voting as difficult as possible. Fact off the matter is that you should be trying to make voting as easy as possible, instead of making it harder. Putting the Election Day in the middle of working day does make it harder to vote. So why not simply change it to be on a weekend, or Sunday? Now it has been decided to have it on a weekday, you could make a different decision. But that can't be done, because...?

Those ""weapons"" are a very essential element for being successful in winning a war. Hence, if Ukraine were to be equiped with more weapons it would greatly reduce Putin's probability of winning.

Are you still following, Olaf? Great, now here's the interesting part. Germany, the country that you represent, happens to have many many companies that manufacture such ""weapons"".

So, your country is actually already capable to produce exactly what is required to prevent Putin from winning. Incredible, isn't it?

Now, those companies would love to help Ukraine but they can't. And you know why they can't? Because they need your permission to do so.

In addition, those companies expect something in return which experts refer to as ""money"". Money is actually very useful and, you probably are aware of that, you send a lot of that to Putin every day.

Unfortunately, Putin exchanges that ""money"" for ""weapons"" as well and you probably now see where I'm going with this.

You, Olaf, could do *a lot* to prevent Putin from winning. Believe it or not, but with a few simple phone calls and meetings things can get much much better.

So, Olaf, that's it for the moment. I know, I know, things are confusing. But don't hesitate to ask if anything that I tried to explain above is still unclear.

No, they did not send in a fraction of their fighting forces as a feign or a fake out, they sent in their A-Team because that is what you do in a war, you want to get the job done right the first time out so you don't hold back, you let slip all your dogs of war.

Like when the West did the Iraq war crime invasion over WMD that never were? They sent in EVERYTHING even though Iraq was already beat. 

Which was the plan for Putin's own war crime invasion, hence the Three Day Special Operation which we're on month four of.

So no, there isn't some secret elite army just chomping at the bit waiting to be unleashed, there's reserves and dregs and whatever animals Putin can roust from whatever cells they're rotting in.

*The United States will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes the Ukrainian side to win in the war unleashed by Russia, and only Ukraine has the right to decide its future.*  
  
*The relevant statement was made by the US Department of State in a commentary to Ukrinform.*  
  
*“We firmly believe that only Ukraine has the right to decide its future,” the US Department of State Spokesperson said in response to Ukrinform’s information inquiry about Washington’s official stance on the statement made by former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger at the World Economic Forum in Davos.*  
  
*The US Department of State emphasized: “We don’t know when this war will be over, but we know this: Ukraine will emerge victorious. And the United States will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes”.*  
  
*A reminder that Mr. Kissinger suggested Ukraine should cede territory to Russia to help end the invasion. He pushed the West to force Ukraine into accepting negotiations with a “status quo ante”, which means the previous state of affairs. He also urged European leaders not to lose sight of Russia’s place in Europe.*",9e7c400d93cdc97458624582de1f3f25893ea022,True,False,,,,,0,1653592187,,0,{},ia3nvwn,True,t3_uyezyf,False,True,t3_uyezyf,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uyezyf/us_department_of_state_on_kissingers_statement/ia3nvwn/,1653592202,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653563387.0,

This also means that most likely instead of having safe-ish logistic hubs, their major eastern cities are gonna be the frontline and start getting shelled to shit. Hurting Ukraine’s population and industry even harder. 

Sadly this is very big for Russia and means Ukraine will have to give most of the land up to Dnipro up + the new combat will be fought on much flatter land and less urban areas for awhile which means Russia will have even more tactical advantages with their armies strengths

I can only hope Russia makes some more serious tactical blunders like Kyiv but in Popasna they showed that they might have learned from their mistakes a little.

As soon as word spread about the attack by pro-Russian demonstrators, a call by pro-Maidan demonstrators to go to Kulikovo Field and destroy the anti-Maidan camp emerged on social networks.[67] As a result, the pro-Russian crowd was later overwhelmed by the pro-Maidan demonstrators, and their encampment outside the Trade Unions House building was torched.[43][46][79] This forced the pro-Russian activists to enter that building, and occupy it.[79] The building is five storeys tall, and is the headquarters of the Odessa regional federation of trade unions.[80] It is located on Kulikovo Field, in the city centre.[80]

Reports about the precise sequence of events that followed vary between different sources, including several confirmed fake reports being spread through social networks.[81] While defending the building, militants on the roof tossed rocks and petrol bombs at the protesters below.[43][46][59][82] A report by the Ukrainian Independent Information Agency (UNIAN) said that the pro-Maidan crowd began to throw petrol bombs into the building after having been fired upon by the pro-Russian group.[83] BBC News said that the situation was unclear, with multiple sources indicating that both sides had been throwing petrol bombs at each other. One eyewitness told the BBC that the fire started on the third floor when a petrol bomb was thrown at a closed window from inside the building, and the Kyiv Post reported that several flaming bottles held by Ukrainian unity activists outside were thrown into the front entrance, and through the windows on the second and fourth floors.[43][54][59] An official investigation conducted by the Ukrainian Interior Ministry stated that while no firearms were found inside the building, those on the roof were shooting at the crowd below, and accidentally set the building on fire whilst throwing petrol bombs from above.[84][85] One of the pro-Maidan protesters who was shot (non-fatally) by a sniper from the trade unions building was Andrey Krasilnikov, a Russian citizen and Euromaidan activist.[73]

As reported by the International Advisory Panel of the Council of Europe, forensic examination of the fire by the Ukrainian Ministry of the Interior identified five independent fire centres: in the lobby of the building, on the staircases between the ground and first floors, in a room on the first floor, and on the landing between the second and third floors (para. 122).[71] The fire centres other than in the lobby could only have been started as a result of the actions of persons inside the building. According to the Prosecutor General’s Office, the fire started in the lobby and people died as a result of the rapid spread of the fire due to the chimney effect of the central stairwell. Molotov cocktails had been used by both parties to the conflict, and that there was no evidence of pre-planned arson or of the use of chloroform or other toxic agents (para. 123).[71] These findings were confirmed by the 2 May Group's investigation,[71] which reported that the blaze started when the barricade in front of the entrance to the building caught fire as a result of the exchange of Molotov cocktails; the fire subsequently spread through the entrance door into the lobby of the building (Annex VII). According to the 2 May Group, many people fled to upper floors and died rather than leaving the building through the other exits on the ground floor, possibly because they were afraid of the pro-unity activists outside. No-one died in the Trade Union Building other than as a direct result of the fire: most of the victims died from carbon monoxide poisoning and burn injuries, and some others as a result of trying to escape the fire by jumping out of the building (Annex VII).[71]

Fifty anti-Maidan activists remained on the roof, barricading themselves in and refusing to leave,[71] and evacuated the building at around 4 am, after long negotiations with the police.[61] Some of those who tried to escape the fire were set upon and beaten during their attempts to flee by some pro-Maidan demonstrators, and video footage shows people being assaulted by pro-Maidan protesters after they had jumped out of the windows of the burning building, while other pro-Maidan demonstrators created makeshift ladders and platforms and used them to rescue people trapped inside the building (para. 28).[71][59][68][86] According to witnesses, some pro-Maidan demonstrators outside the building chanted ""burn Colorads, burn,"" referring to a derogatory term for pro-Russian activists who wear the Ribbon of Saint George.[68]

The high number of deaths may also have been caused by the delay in the emergency services' response, according to the International Advisory Panel of the Council of Europe and to the investigations by the 2 May Group.[87] The first fire crews took up to 40 minutes to arrive at the scene even though the closest fire station was less than a five minute drive away. The audio recording of the telephone calls to the dispatch centre was later posted on the Internet, and the dispatcher can be heard telling callers that there was no risk involved in burning tents in an open space, and then hanging up; at some point she consulted a superior as to whether she should continue to respond in this way and was instructed to do so (para. 26).[71] Representatives of the State Emergency Service claimed that the large number of people gathered around the building[80] and the aggressive behaviour on some of them[71] prevented the fire crews from performing their job promptly, but the investigation by the 2 May Group did not find any evidence of access by fire crews having been obstructed (para. 27).[71]

The local police was also slow to intervene. According to the International Advisory Panel, they started to arrest protesters only after 41 persons had already died and, when the fire was extinguished, they entered the building and arrested 63 anti-Maidan who were still inside or on the roof (para. 30)",b80368db1d05592579838c42bd61d010ff53b2b3,True,False,,,,,0,1653590176,,0,{},ia3izdc,True,t3_uy0hri,False,True,t1_ia3iymw,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uy0hri/severodonetsk_ukrainian_troops_have_successfully/ia3izdc/,1653590191,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653561376.0,

According to the 2 May Group investigation, local authorities had met representatives of the pro-Maidan and anti-Maidan camp and had agreed with them to dismantle the tent camp of the anti-Maidan protesters in Odessa, in preparation to the Victory Parade of the 9th of May.[63][60] The camp had been set up on 26 January in Shevchenko Avenue and later had moved to Kulykove Pole, in the centre of Odessa, in front of the Trade Union House. The plan for dismantling the camp was agreed by representatives of local authorities and police, by pro-Maidan leaders and also by some anti-Maidan leaders, who thought that the maintenance of their camp had become too expensive and detrimental to their cause.[64] The dismantling of the tent camp should have taken place in the late evening of 2 May, after the football game Chernomorets vs Metallist. According to the original plan agreed by the factions in secret, the demolition of the tents had to take his hands out of gangs of football fans ""ultras"" after the end of a football match. Liquidation of the tent camp in this way the interests of all parties and should have happened without casualties or violent fightings: this way, anti-Maidan forces would have avoided the embarassment of shutting the campo down themselves and instead be later able to claim that they were victimized.[65] Capturing the House of Trade Unions, as well as the fierce resistance during dismantling was not part of such plan.[64] The police was also supposed to detain and isolate radical activists from both sides, avoiding excessive use of force. According to the 2 May Group investigation, the plan was foiled when the tent-camp leadership split and one radical anti-Maidan group issued an appeal to anti-Maidan activists to gather in downtown Odesa to prevent a march of ""fascists"".[note 1][66][65]

A rally at 14:00 for national unity was held in Sobornaya Square by about 1,500 people, including many FC Chornomorets Odesa and FC Metalist Kharkiv fans, along with right-wing Right Sector members and ordinary people.[44][43][67] Joint marches among the sports fans are a regular tradition before all football matches in the area.[59] As they marched down Derybasivska Street, fans of both teams sang the Ukrainian national anthem together, chanted patriotic slogans such as ""Odessa, Kharkiv, Ukraine"", and sang other songs against Russian President Vladimir Putin.[59][68] OSCE monitors reported that they saw around one hundred pro-unity activists in camouflage with sticks and shields participating in the march.[69]

Attendees told journalists beforehand that they had found out through social media that ""anti-Maidan supporters were calling for everyone to gather and crush the unification march.""[67] One of the pages called on their supporters in Odessa to ""take after Donetsk,"" a reference to pro-Russian attacks that took place against pro-Maidan demonstrators in Donetsk days prior.[59] A leaflet that said the pro-Russian groups would ""defend Odessa from pogroms"" was distributed across the city before the rally.[68] 

This rally was later attacked by a anti-Maidan mob of 300 from the group Odesskaya Druzhina (Russian: Одесская дружина) armed with bats and firearms at Hretska Street.[43][54][70] Police did not attempt to separate the two rallies from one another.[59]

As reported by the Council of Europe, police officers made little, if any, effort to intervene and stop the violence, and video footage gave rise to allegations of collusion between the police and anti-Maidan protesters (para. 20 and 78). [71] Another circumstance which raised suspicion was that police officers put red adhesive tape around their arms, as did anti-Maidan protesters, to identify themselves (para. 79).[71] The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine also reported an inadequate police presence to ensure security.[15] Some 700 police officers were deployed at the stadium, a further 100 officers followed the pro-unity rally, a few dozen were deployed at Kulykove Pole; about 100 officers were standing by in the vicinity.[71][52]


**Escalation into clashes**

Following the attack on the pro-Maidan rally, numerous fights broke out. Both sides fought running battles against one other, exchanging stones and petrol bombs, and built barricades throughout the city during the afternoon.[72] According to OHCHR both sides had various kinds of helmets, masks, shields, axes, wooden or metal sticks, and firearms.[15] According to OmTV there were mostly air pistols and the first actual firearms use was by Antimaidan activist Vitaly Budko (""Botsman"") who opened fire with an AK-74 rifle using 5.45 bullets. Witnesses pointed out that he was shooting from behind the police line, effectively covered by the law enforcement operatives. The first victim was Igor Ivanov, who died from a 5.45 bullet.[59][73][74][75] Some shots were fired from the roof top of the Afina shopping centre to shoot down at the crowds.[43] Budko later left the scene in ambulance together with police commander Dmitry Fuchedzhy (Russian: Дмитрий Фучеджи). Afterwards the pro-Russian activists claimed that Budko was using blank rounds or, in another version, an airsoft replica. However, analysis of videos by the 2 May Group proved that Budko was indeed using a real AK-74 with live rounds.[76] Fuchedzhy shortly after fled to Russia and obtained Russian citizenship, while Russian law enforcement denied any legal help to Ukrainian investigation of his role in the tragedy.[77]

Videos from the killing of Ivanov, rapidly spreading in social networks, was – according to people interviewed by OmTV – the tipping point in the conflict and resulted in bringing in a large number of Molotov cocktails, further airguns and hunting rifles to the conflict. Four anti-Maidan activists died from firearms shortly after on Hretska Ploshcha: Evgeniy Losinsky, Alexandr Zhulkov, Nikolai Yavorskiy – from hunting bullets, and Gennadiy Petrov – from 5.6 bullets.[52][55][56][78][73]",72390138c677f384770b1f87c6762e9d00831c72,True,False,,,,,0,1653590168,,0,{},ia3iymw,True,t3_uy0hri,False,True,t1_ia359iz,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uy0hri/severodonetsk_ukrainian_troops_have_successfully/ia3iymw/,1653590184,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653561368.0,

The Phz2000 is pretty much unparalled for its MRSI ability.  Just 2 of these systems can put 10 rounds on one target simultaneously (depending on range), and fire at a continued rate of 10 rounds per minute.   Its better then a battery of almost any other artillery whether towed or self propelled.   

My gut check is they will operate them in 6 teams of 2, as each team can easily demolish any attack via 2-3 minutes of continuous fire: 40- 60 rounds of ammo landing on anything is going to be a very bad day for the recipient.  And they can fire from a range that Russia does not possess for anything other then some MLRS.

But the Phz2000 is not operating in isolation.  Ukraine has received CAESARS, M777s in large quantity, DANAs, and at least 20 M109A3GN (and perhaps 40) are either in country or on their way.

This is the major factor here - what will finally wake up Russians beaten-down population who are being used as cannon fodder?

The Russian media can play these clips as b-roll footage in new stories to counter any complaints from families that Putin doesn't care. 

But for the families who have sons, husbands and brothers in Ukraine who never come home - will they want to go to these hospitals to see the wounded to see if their loved on is there?

And it's also interesting how unwounded these ""soldiers"" seem. Both have all their limbs. No burns. No visible injuries.  What about support for the Russian soldiers who have lost limbs and need prosthetics?

That's why I think it's crucial that the families of Russian soldiers see the other side of the fence - the Russia that could exist if it was free of Putin where there might be international assistance to help make Russia a modern, westernize society rather than see the west as evil and blaming the west/NATO for all their problems.

It's only when Putin's propaganda is revealed to be deceiving the Russian population that they're going to turn against him, and that's going to need to make sure enough people know how badly returning Russian soldiers are treated and how disrespectful Putin's government has been to their dead soldiers.",90788eddbc2367c32d1a0ca9163ef50076cb8cb4,True,False,,,,,0,1653588497,,0,{},ia3evgd,False,t3_uy7qrz,False,False,t3_uy7qrz,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uy7qrz/photos_of_putin_visiting_wounded_soldiers/ia3evgd/,1653588515,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653559697.0,

First, the Russian army has become a joke because they did make strategic and tactical blunders, discipline is hard to find for them being rapists, looters and marauders, and a far smaller army has repelled them on two fronts so far. But that does not preclude the Russians are never going to be able to fix their problems as the war progresses. Russia still has a LOT of bodies to throw at the Ukrainians without a flinch, AND not care whether they get killed, go missing, or come back alive. Russian populace will not rise up, their psychological conditioning has been doing on for decades.

Oh but Russia already lost so many of their good kits... T-62 from a museum can still kill soft targets, artillery from WW2 leftovers can still fire and level a grid as long as there are compatible shells somewhere. Even if a half of their old shit breaks down on their own, Russia can just double down on quantity. That in itself is a problem because it can still thin out the Ukrainian defence lines regardless of the exchange ratio. The latest breakout around Popasna and the encroachment towards Severodonetsk show this.

Second, on a flip side, it could be argued that the Russians are held back because it was the Ukrainians who are fighting them with absolute grit and bravery. Hopefully, the Poles can fight likewise bravely, though one does not wish things come to that, and Poland has been paying attention to readiness for quite some time.

But Germany or the rest of western Europe? Are we sure they have the same level of grit as the Ukrainians? What NATO is basically the full might of the U.S. holding up the ceiling, by design. Conscription is long gone since the end of the cold war, professional military is large enough to field what, how many brigades? 

The whole German society has been committed to pacifism, which is good in the sense that they will not start stirring up new shit ever again, but they seem to have really never thought about external threats other than some Islamic terrorists because the U.S. is still parked there. Any and all military feature has been removed and castrated from the fabric of the society, and it's not a light switch they can turn back on at will.

So, despite the depravity and messiness of the Russian army, we can't really say for certain that the Russians would still fumble to the same degree if - hypothetically - their starting point was the German border instead of the Ukrainian border.",f51a196dcadfa53bab971d6a822239a30f6dfb7c,True,False,,,,,0,1653588486,,0,{},ia3euhf,False,t3_uya1cl,False,True,t1_ia397oq,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uya1cl/this_is_the_reality_of_scholzs_approach_he_doesnt/ia3euhf/,1653588499,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653559686.0,

Look at China and how most governments are fine with their genocide against the Uyghurs and crushing their population into being compliant sheople.

That is sort of the model that Putin is using.

Nothing like that could happen now - that's exactly what Putin has put in place to prevent, both crushing anyone starting up opposition like Navalny and massive amounts of police presence to drag off anyone who tries to protest. 

It's the same that China has done to prevent anything like the Tiananmen Square protests from happening again.

But the global community is fine if China oppresses their popularity into compliance and peace. The Chinese give up their free speech and human rights for everyone to just get along and everyone to get cheap goods from China.

It's the same logic some idiots like Kissinger have over Ukraine. It doesn't matter if Ukrainians lose their rights like Belarusians as long as the world has cheap food.

The longer the war drags on, the more instability there is, the more there's global think tanks and politicians willing to sacrifice human rights for stability.

Aggression should never be rewarded.

As he says in the link:

“In Russia, they openly say that they will not stop in Ukraine. They need the Baltic states, Poland and other European countries. That is why we must restore full respect for the fundamental values on our continent. We must fight absolutely clearly and at all levels for the principle: every nation matters. The interests of any nation cannot be ignored, betrayed or exchanged for something in a relationship with those who want to make that nation dependent on themselves,” Zelensky said in his address to the Parliament of Latvia, Ukrinform reports.

“Even in the very recent past, this disrespect for certain nations has led to terrible and insidious conspiracies and pacts that deprived statehood, destroyed borders and inflamed the appetite for war. Millions of people died because of it. The lives of generations have been poisoned.”

“There are quite serious talks about drawing some dividing lines along the body of a sovereign state in order to allegedly ‘appease’ the aggressor. And allegedly concessions, concessions and concessions again are needed - of course, at the expense of the state, which was attacked, so that the aggressor allegedly mercifully stops,” the President stressed.

“When we are told that we have to give away part of our land because it is supposed to be a ‘necessary compromise’, it means that our people are considered less worthy of having their interests taken into account. Moreover, when they ask us to wait ‘a little longer’ in the European Union's reception room – years or decades – not agreeing to give us full membership, and some still doubt the candidate status for Ukraine, it only emphasizes that the principle of respect for every nation does not work,” Zelensky added.

Further on Zelensky’s refusal to cede land for peace while rejecting Kissinger’s advice, see this compelling thread debating the issue:

It seems like Ukraine's path to victory is by drawing this out and making Russia sustain losses for months until there's unrest in Russia. But from a military perspective the Kremlin creates the narrative and the false reality that the Russians live in so they can just keep trumpeting the great progress they're making especially as they annex territory. 

If it's due to economic collapse well that is going to happen with or without Russian military victory because the West is not undoing the sanctions or allowing Russia to normalize again with the world economy and the energy dependence will continue to be unwinded.

1888,[],False,,Aenness,,,[],,,,text,t2_kx77anvv,False,True,"Since mid-April, Russia has focused its invasion of Ukraine on capturing the eastern region known as the Donbas. According to military reports, the fighting here has been largely positional battles without significant advancements by either side. Both Russia and Ukraine have built up their forces, regrouped, and continued artillery fire. In the last week, however, statements by officials in Kyiv have become more alarming, as if Ukraine’s leadership is preparing the nation for a major defeat: the loss of Severodonetsk (one of the last big cities in the region still under Ukrainian control) and a “new Mariupol.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says the situation at the frontlines in the Donbas is dire. “Bakhmut, Popasna, Severodonetsk — it’s in these directions that the occupiers have concentrated their efforts. They’re slaughtering people there and trying to destroy all life. No one has ever caused so much damage to the Donbas as Russian soldiers are inflicting right now,” Zelensky said, summarizing the 89th day of the war. “Russia has effectively thrown the entire remaining might of its army at this offensive,” he added, the next day.

Presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych has described the course of the war even more grimly, warning that the Russian military has outpaced Ukraine’s Armed Forces. “The Russian side managed to build up its reserves sooner,” he told Mark Feygin in a YouTube broadcast on May 25, detailing Russia’s apparent plans to create “a new Mariupol” by encircling Ukraine’s troops in the Donbas:

&gt; “They’re trying to break through here, from Vrubivka, and to cut off the road in the area of Berestove. That’s one of the main goals — to disrupt the supply links between Bakhmut and Lysychansk. If you look at Siversk, you’ll see a little ‘pocket’ along the railway that they’re trying to close, from Siversk to Berestove. So, there’s a little ‘pocket’ forming, which Yampil, Siversk, Popasna, Vrubivka… And they’re closing it, and Lysychansk and Severodonetsk remain surrounded. That’s their main goal right now — to create a ‘new Mariupol.’

&gt; “Continuous artillery and air strikes, almost nonstop ground attacks by the enemy. They have superiority in artillery and aviation. To put it mildly, we’re barely afloat.”

In addition to the encirclement of the Donbas, Arestovych also predicts that Russia will increase its pressure along the Kherson-Zaporizhia line, north of Crimea. Further north, Russia could even mount another assault on Kyiv itself. Vadim Skibitsky, the spokesman for Ukraine’s Intelligence Main Directorate, has corroborated these concerns, saying that Russia is moving troops from Crimea to the Kherson region and occupied parts of Zaporizhia. “They’re preparing the necessary engineering structures and planning not just one or two but three lines of defense. It’s these military indicators that suggest Russia’s intentions to seize and hold these territories,” explained Skibitsky.

The city of Severodonetsk (which became the Luhansk region’s administrative center after the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic captured the city of Luhansk) isn’t yet surrounded, but it’s under constant artillery fire, like the highway between Bakhmut and Lysychansk, according to Luhansk Governor Serhiy Haidai. There are currently around 12,500 people still in the city, and 90 percent of all housing is damaged or destroyed, according to Mayor Oleksandr Stryuk.

Separatist officials claim to have advanced further, however. LNR militia spokesman Andrey Marochko says Lysychansk and Severodonetsk are now under “operational encirclement” and besieged on three sides. Russia’s Defense Ministry, meanwhile, has not reported any major breakthroughs in the Donbas.

In an interview with Ukrayinska Pravda, the commander of Ukraine’s “Svoboda” volunteer battalion, Petro Kuzyk, said Russian troops likely plan to capture Severodonetsk by the same means they used to take the city of Rubizhne in mid-May, essentially by wiping it off the face of the Earth with a constant barrage of artillery. “On average,” explained Kuzyk, “they fire between 20 and 50 shots for every one of our shells”:

“They hammer our positions with artillery, and their infantry advances under artillery cover, sometimes together with tanks. As a rule, their infantry suffers losses, retreats, and then the artillery goes back to work, before another two or three infantry assaults.

“Using these massive artillery bombardments, the Russians are able to advance, since they are destroying our positions, our trenches, and our buildings, step by step… And they’re under orders to level Ukrainian cities.”

In chorus with other Ukrainian officials, Petro Kuzyk calls on the West to provide additional technical support to Ukraine’s Armed Forces, especially artillery systems, multiple rocket launchers, air defense systems, tanks, and fighter jets. Without more parity on the battlefield, Russians will likely surround Ukraine’s troops in the area, warns Kuzyk. “At best, our men will retreat and look for new fortifications… It’s a mistake to rely solely on the heroism of soldiers,” he warned.

As Ukraine’s problems mount at the frontlines, some politicians and observers in the West have suggested that Kyiv should consider making territorial concessions to Moscow in order to hasten the war’s end.

President Zelensky has condemned these proposals, accusing figures like Henry Kissinger of ignoring Ukrainians for the sake of appeasing the Kremlin. “The ‘great geopoliticians’ advising Ukraine to surrender something to Russia never want to see ordinary people — ordinary Ukrainians,” said Zelensky. “We must do everything possible to cultivate the habit of taking Ukraine into account, so Ukrainians’ interests aren’t drowned out by the interests of those hurrying to their next meeting with a dictator.”

Oleksiy Arestovych responded even more harshly: “Russia just needs the Zaporizhia and Kherson regions — no big deal! Then we can have a new peace settlement in Europe, and the Ukrainians will just have to ‘curb their appetites.’ We’ll build a comprehensive peace in Europe on this foundation. Business as usual,” he explained in a YouTube broadcast on May 25, before telling everyone who endorses such ideas: “Go fuck yourselves, you dumbfucks, with these fucking plans.”",80b20039bff9b55f48af32495fd1b24670cc4dfe,True,False,,,,,0,1653586685,,0,{},ia3adqh,True,t3_uycznm,False,True,t3_uycznm,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uycznm/in_the_last_week_statements_by_officials_in_kyiv/ia3adqh/,1653586703,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653557885.0,

**BUT,** even if Mr. Scholz were a hardliner against Russia to the degree of Poland and the Baltic states, isn't it that the correct read of the situation is German inventory is so hollowed out and they don't have serious firepower to give?

Recall that overall combat readiness of the German forces was abysmal under Merkel. Back when the ISIS was a big thing, and the Kurdish Peshmerga militia was the only effective force in the region, Germany wanted to give them some small arms. Ursula von der Leyen was then the defence minister, she wanted to hand over the kits to the Kurds herself, but the Luftwaffe couldn't even get their transport up in the air on time.

Having X number of tanks and IFVs and howitzers on the book doesn't mean they are combat ready. Even if they are still commissioned. Germany still has to consider NATO commitment to the Baltics, which they may not even be able to deliver if the shit hits the fan, therefore they cannot afford to transfer what small number left of their functioning fleet.

Surely, German defence contractors can start churning out quality equipment if an order is placed. But that will take them years even if things go full steam from tomorrow. Ukraine doesn't have that much time.

So, this outsider can guess that Germany won't be ready for anything serious for another decade if not a generation, be that may military readiness or energy supply. The willingness of the public and the national leadership could still make some difference, but it still seems like Germany sees its stake in this war as a matter of exercising generosity towards Ukraine, with a dash of pity for all the massacres, but not an existential threat to their own. Indeed, Poland is a nice buffer to have.

Belgium and Czechia have ordered them, but this was late last year/early this year so they are unlikely to have received many/any. Denmark is only current operator besides France, who is sending weapons to Ukraine and since they only have 19-23pcs and it is their only artillery system it sadly seems highly unlikely they could/would offer any of them especially right after promising another high profile weapon like the Harpoon Missiles.

&amp;#x200B;

Even with double the numbers at 400 the pfz2000 again is produced in quite few numbers and is with operators who a) use it as their primary artillery system and b) don't have that many artillery pieces in working condition so unlikely to be offered in any meaningful quantities. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's again another reason why my money is on the M109 becoming the most numerous self propelled howitzer that will be sent to Ukraine. With around 10.000 units in various models over time made there are just a lot more of them around. Although the earliest models from the 60s-80s are probably too warn out to be of much use. But as you saw with Norway, they had switched to a new system and put their M109's in storage. Lot of other countries have done the same and it's a lot easier politically to send retired weapon systems than taking from current ones. I bet the US has tons of these lying around that might not be in their newest versions M109A6 / M109A7 but would still pack a punch and could easily be transferred as part of lendlease or the 40b package.

Oryx only uses photographic evidence (you can literally check every photo yourself) so real figures will be significantly higher and admittedly that is only for vehicles but just on the motorised side the Russians have lost four times as many vehicles as the ukrainians (there is an argument to be made about which side is taking more pictures of enemy losses but it still seems the most reliable numbers available) so the Russians have lost four times as many vehicle crews. Experienced crews have an edge over fresh combatants so all other things being equal the ukrainians have the edge.  Of course despite what Hollywood would have us believe sheer numbers can overwhelm even the best combatants but experience really counts. Losing trained personnel is a serious issue, One of Britain's biggest problems during the battle of Britain wasn't supplying aircraft but finding people to crew them. 

All I'm suggesting in my earlier post is that whatever the difference in numbers, Ukraine has lost less veterans and a unit with a larger proportion of experienced personnel will suffer even less casualties proportionally as the average combat time of a unit increases. I'm sure Russia has some very experienced units but the ukrainians haven't been sending their soldiers into high casualty  situations like the Russians have and after three months of war that is probably starting to show in the performance of units. Still got most of the boys from the start? They're grizzled, capable survivors. Just lost 2/3 of the boys in hellish combat? Their replacements will be green with fewer experienced soldiers available to help the latest reinforcements learn how to survive so die faster, need reinforced faster and you get a death spiral until like the nazis you're sending children against stone killers who've just fought all the way across Europe.",99f99db3bf2139b8c7350ab915a0969a46d966b5,True,False,,,,,0,1653583115,,0,{},ia31bpz,False,t3_uy0hri,False,True,t1_ia2pr6d,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uy0hri/severodonetsk_ukrainian_troops_have_successfully/ia31bpz/,1653583128,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653554315.0,

There is also an effect on losses as different units are rotated in and out, resulting in reductions in losses of one tank type, and increases in losses of another type. An example would be the T-80U losses drying up as the 4th Guards tank division was rotated out, but then again they were rotated out due to extremely heavy losses (and no other unit uses the T-80U) so it's fair to conclude that they are running out of combat ready T-80Us.",f18e162558d8ed66b1179e6bc5dafe6444371dc1,True,False,,,,,0,1653582947,,0,{},ia30wea,True,t3_uy9z8p,False,True,t1_ia2xb7p,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uy9z8p/i_created_a_graph_that_shows_russias_tank_losses/ia30wea/,1653582958,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653554147.0,

Oh no, sweetie, honey pie, no you are failing to understand the situation.

See it was supposta be a three day special operation and within 72 hours profesional analysts who said the best Ukraine could hope for would be an Iraqi style insurgency to grind the occupiers out over a few years if at all realized how wrong they were; the Russian army was stopped, dead. All the key victories needed never materialized, war lost in the first 72 hours, a modern European record I think.

See they fucked up the following:

Needed to take the airport so fresh troops and supplies could be flown in as needed, denied. In fact worse than denied the crack Russian paratroopers sent to do the job got proper fucked and now are dust in the wind. Those troops? Hard to replace, it takes quite a bit to train soldiers to jump out of planes into combat. 

Needed to establish ground logistics and supply lines for the ground forces instead they got stuck in the mud where they were picked off like a carnival turkey shoot. Lost all those trucks and tanks and personnel not to mention supplies. It also demonstrated that Russia can't go that far beyond her borders, can't project power you have no power.

Needed to establish air superiority, need to own the skies and Russia's air force has been more farce; the few planes they've sent in got blown out of the sky which was shocking because they should have been too high to get hit but as it turns out Russia's smart bombs aren't available so they need to go with the dumb ones which means you have to fly low and slow rather than fire and forget. We had a SU get picked off by a Stinger! In any other airforce that would just not happen, all the ground forces would hear would be the faint roar of the engine too high to see and then the booms as the smart bombs come a calling.

But it seems Russia doesn't have any smarts in anything military. 

So your amateur analyst's finding that there has been a major Russian breakthrough might be so, they may have punched a hole in a line, maybe taken a mile or two, so what? What is that going to get them? The much needed airport? The major city? A steady supply of fresh munitions, troops and supplies? Anything that they need to win the war? 

No, it won't, all it does is prolong the inevitable; Russia lost, Putin lost, now we are just seeing how much more they want to lose.

So like I said, it's hard to pimp propaganda for losers that everyone knows are losing but still, you can do better than this.

Can't you?

If not, quit, find a new job, perhaps the NRA? Musk? Lots of evil out there you can work for, at least pick one that isn't so pathetic.",5b6393686b334d68c0c830e289a79edeb1a42985,True,False,,,,,0,1653578456,,0,{},ia2pkyc,False,t3_uy0hri,False,True,t1_ia2kvfu,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uy0hri/severodonetsk_ukrainian_troops_have_successfully/ia2pkyc/,1653578476,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653549656.0,

True, but not indicative.

\&gt;  Ukraine can survive like this longer than Russia can.

Ukraine doesn't have hundreds of millions of dollars coming in per day in energy revenues.   The Ukrainian economy is utterly, utterly devastated at this point.   Virtually every sector of its economy, including literally every sector of its export economy, has been devastated.

""Ukraine doesn't ""need"" their ports reopened, the rest of the world does.""

Maybe in some made up world where economics doesnt matter.  Tell me again how heat will be supplied to a country of 40m if this situation continues into the fall and winter?

""A ""neutral"" Ukraine is an ethically unacceptable outcome. I doubt the genocided are in favour of neutrality. Besides, Ukraine was already neutral and guaranteed by Russia itself.""

the rest of your post, starting from this, is you, sitting in a warm, pleasant place somewhere in the west making an 'ethical' stand on somebody else's dime.  And, you downvoted me not because you 'disagree' with me, but because i pointed out that such idealistic views may not survive contact with the actual situation on the ground.  I mean, respectfully, I want you to look in the mirror and have a think about how idiotic your statement about ukraine not needing their export economy restarted is.  Have you even been to ukraine even once?  

I want nothing more than for putin to be punished and put in the hague. and for ukraine to be free and whole and in NATO and in the EU and for victims to face justice.

 I've been working on these goals for decades.  But the reality right now on the ground, whether you like it or not, whether you upvote me or downvote me, is that it is very hard to see how Ukraine will regain substantive control over its 4 provinces (and also crimea) unless there is some ""miracle"" event - like putin dying and the whole system collapsing with him.   The russians have made numerous, comical mistakes in the last months, but they have, unfortunately, learned.  And what they are doing now is a slow systematic grinding from those four provinces across a wide front and with considerably improved logistical support that Ukraine isn't matching right now.  

And yes, the Ukrainian resistance and spirit may indeed lead to some sort of standstill - but unless the US really surprises with the sort of weapons it delivers, that's probably all ukraine can do.  We are very much in a situation where neither side might be able to make substantial gains.  But, as far as being able to reconquer the four provinces, some sort of magical change is needed. Let's hope it comes, but also let's not delude ourselves into thinking that hoping it comes and being ""ethnically clear"" in our vision will do this.",f6ec4f02d0291b37cdac5bd08ba25e9f54eec98c,True,False,,,,,0,1653578114,,0,{},ia2oq55,False,t3_uy3enz,False,True,t1_ia2lorb,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uy3enz/kissinger_calls_to_cede_to_russia_akin_to_1930s/ia2oq55/,1653578128,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653549314.0,

Thus most of the initial fighters in the IAF were NOT US made. They were ( surprise, surprise) : French !

The French Mirage and Mystere were the main fighters.

The French Fuga was the main trainer ( and what stopped the Jordanian army as they advanced towards Jerusalem).

Yes, Israel had Sikorsky helicopters back then. But your rendition of the beginning of the IAF is simply wrong.

One other fact for the anti Israel redditors: unlike other ME countries, Israel always fought for its defence. There were never American TROOPS sent to defend Israel. Just think of how many lives were lost from Iraq to Afghanistan when the US tried to help allies or fight bad guys.

Israel * NEVER* fought a war against any mythical ""Palestinian"" state.

If you look at the map pre 1967, you WILL find out that Israel was surrounded by : Lebanon  Syria, Jordan, Egypt. Surprisingly NO ""Palestine"" !

""Palestine"" was the area of the **British** mandate which included BOTH Jews, Arabs, christians and more.

After the British left, AGAIN, there was still NO country left behind, called ""Palestine"".

So in 1967, the entire Arab world decided to wipe 2.5 million Israelies off the face of the earth ( as they still try to do. Including the so called ""Palestinians"", every few years).

Syria, Jordan and Egypt, were the ONLY neighboring countries which fought Israel,  LOST.

When you try to wipe a country off the face of the earth, and LOSE, there is no requirement you get back the territory you lost.

Yet Israel ( the  ""colonial"" power as  few ignorant redditors claim) returned the entire Sinai peninsula to Egypt in return for PEACE ! ( What Zelensky refuses to do BTW. I am on Zelensky's side on this ).


The west bank which was land, JORDAN took without asking anyone, and lost during the 6 Days War is what's called today ""Palestinian territory"". ISRAEL thought that by creating a self governing entity they Will finally get peace.

Instead they got another Arab entity bent on its destruction.

So to recap Israel NEVER occupied the land of a country that didn't exist.

In fact, here is some food for thought for redditors:

Had Israel lost the 6 Days War, not only there won't be any Israeli LIBERAL DEMOCRACY in the entire Middle East, but I guarantee you, there won't be ANY talk, discussion, ANYTHING about a ""Palestinian State"".

The area will be occupied by Jordan, Syria and Egypt, and they most likely will be fighting each other.

3201,[],False,,offogredux,,,[],,,,text,t2_15rb79,False,True,"A big problem is that Scotty won't get off his fat arse and fix the transporter. It takes time to move weapons and supplies from the U.S., Canada or Australia. The 155 howitzers announced a month ago are still arriving. The U.S has gear pre-positioned in Europe,  but except for stingers, 155 shells and ATGMs, most of it isn't compatible with Ukraine's gear or is current gen stuff we aren't giving away. If Ukraine had the knowledge base to use and maintain Strykers we could give them a hundred or two tomorrow, and the problems with a Bradley are even bigger, so we are going a gen back to M-113s , which are mechanically less complicated and easier to use, but each one needs to be inspected and tuned up before shipping. What this means is that the time lag can be up to 60 days.  

Second, a lot of gear HAS been provided already. Several hundred T-72s to start with, a ton of BMPs and a fair number of M113s, plus close to 200 artillery pieces. But they have mostly gone into back filling losses to regular UAF brigade losses from the units that fought in Kharkiv-Kyiv, or to fill  out the reserve brigades. There's also hundreds of captured Russian vehicles, but only a fraction of them are captured in 'combat ready' condition, most are damaged or broken down, so they go into the rehab/repair chain, not the supply chain. 

Finally, the capacity to transport supplies is limited, though ramping up, and first priority was given to munitions, particularly artillery ammo. For the first 30 days, ammo took up pretty much the entire logistical pipe line, but without the shells provided, Ukraine would be out of 152mm rounds, rockets and ATGMs. The shift to 155 standard hasn't helped the munitions pipeline either, but  was necessary. 

Finally, in times of war, combatants ALWAYS need more of everything, and will keep asking in strident tones, because squeaky wheels get grease.

The good news is that time has marched on, and gear pulled out of storage or claimed from National  Guard units have received maintenance and are on boats headed for Europe- They should arrive real soon, and keep arriving. Second, and perhaps more important, the Eastern European countries that opened their repair and rehab centers to Ukraine are  beginning to return vehicles to Ukraine- Ukraine probably has (with Nato assistance) greater rehab/refurb capacity than Russia, which will be lucky to return a major portion of their maintenance backlog to the campaign for 60-90 days.  There's also a high probability of a final wave of ex-soviet gear that will hit soon from the 'poor' or less committed countries, like Bulgaria, not willing to give away their army's gear like Poland did, but waiting for the American offer or better replacement gear, like poland. 

Assistance to Ukraine was approved and ramped up with lightning speed, it borders on miraculous. Some countries, like Germany and Hungary, haven't pulled their weight, but try to understand their world- They're so used to depending on Russian energy they have a kind of Stockholm syndrome, a long pattern of appeasement.  It doesn't help that Germany is all but demilitarized, so doesn't have much extra gear lying about and what they do have is 'complicated', like the Gepards.  And at some point  Nato is going to have to pony up some gear made in this century- probably not tanks or planes, but armored vehicles and SPGs and air defense systems. 

I guess what I'm saying is, it could have been worse, it's getting better, there's always problems , and patience sucks..",9d483d3580aac4986a1698a2374aba8f6639aae4,True,False,,,,,0,1653570908,,0,{},ia27z5a,False,t3_uy5qmp,False,True,t1_ia1zz3g,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uy5qmp/zaluzhnyi_it_is_very_difficult_for_us_but_we_are/ia27z5a/,1653570925,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653542108.0,

This has tailed off a lot now

It happened because Russia kept over-extending heavily, sending one BTG down a road to be wiped out. They also ran out of fuel regularly and retreated from the entire area around Kyiv. These things together meant a lot of abandoned vehicles

Now, though, the front and supply lines are much more stable. When Russia loses tanks etc (eg the river crossing attempt) they tend not to be recoverable by Ukraine as often, and there are no sweeping rapid retreats abandoning vehicles, less fuel shortages due to not operating as far from depots.

Add in the fact that most Russians who were inclined to abandon their vehicles and fuck off, have likely already done so, and you're left with the inescapable conclusion that Ukraine will capture far fewer vehicles going forward",565c8ea2f2d828d0008c9cacfd21ffeaad28033d,True,False,,,,,0,1653569903,,0,{},ia25xbp,False,t3_uy0hri,False,False,t1_ia1zzyw,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uy0hri/severodonetsk_ukrainian_troops_have_successfully/ia25xbp/,1653569916,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653541103.0,

Faced with equipment shortages, deficient leadership, inferior tactics and total logistical collapse, professional grunts think the solution to Ukraine failures is MORE CANNON FODDER.

It would take 5 years to fix the shortcomings now revealed by Russia's failure. There are some processes that cannot be done On The Double. Measurements, assessments and corrections will be required for any new plan to work. And what is shown thus far is total military systemic collapse.

And through all of this we will continue to send supplies to Kiev. And they will keep training rapists and thieves and murderers and then withdrawing them to Donbas to ""keep the peace"" there. Already many people have likely decided ""this isn't what I wanted"" with regard to independence and alliance with Russia, and further exposure to the realities of Russian culture and these soldiers will solidify that sentiment in occupied areas.

There is no way to make use of the current crop of Russian Army troops in those areas defensively. Over the coming weeks, troops will rape and steal in occupied areas BECAUSE THEY SEE THE RESIDENTS AS UKRAINIAN regardless of which oblast they're in.

And that will erode Russian efforts and the Russians will respond to this with atrocity and violence because that is who they are. And so it'll get worse. And then, the minute the UA arrives, the battle will shift immediately toward them. 

And in preparation for this, EU and USA are gonna make sure that every antique firearm and weapon makes its way to the front to arm even these Ukrainians who once thought maybe a separatist republic might be cool to have. Because they'll see it is not a republic, but a puppet regime.

""The failure to anticipate Ukrainian resistance and the subsequent complacency of Russian commanders has led to significant losses across many of Russia's more elite units,"" the UK Ministry of Defence said in a Thursday update.  
  
It said that issues with the work of Russia's elite airborne troops, or VDV, in Ukraine showed how Russia's army has been ""unbalanced"" in the way Russia invests in it.  
  
It said the VDV had been used in situations where ""heavier armored infantry"" would have been more suitable, and as a result ""has sustained heavy casualties during the campaign.""  
  
""Its mixed performance likely reflects a strategic mismanagement of this capability and Russia's failure to secure air superiority,"" it said.  
  
It also said that the VDV ""have been heavily involved in several notable tactical failures since the start of Russia's invasion.""  
  
Russia failed to meet its strategic aims from the onset of the invasion, failing to capture key parts of the country as it expected, and with Russia ceding control of many areas back to Ukraine three months on.   
  
What started as an assault on much of Ukraine, including the capital Kyiv, has turned into a battle focused in the east, near Russia's border. Western intelligence has noted that Russia had expected quick victory in its invasion and that it did not expect a strong resistance from Ukraine.  
  
The exact number of Russian troop losses is unknown, as Russia has not shared them. The UK defense ministry estimated that Russia has lost a third of its forces.  
  
A BBC investigation in April found that Russia's army was losing many elite troops, which are extremely expensive and lost a lot of money to train.  
  
Retired Adm. James Stavridis, former NATO supreme allied commander for Europe, also said earlier this month that ""in modern history, there is no situation comparable in terms of the deaths of generals.""  
  
A Russian veterans group recently criticized Russia's so-called ""special military operation"" a failure, and said it needed to officially declare war on Ukraine and mobilize additional forces.",d262d1d2c939ea97cee10a28b72d2405868d10f2,True,False,,,,,0,1653569256,,0,{},ia24o6i,False,t3_uy63p1,False,True,t3_uy63p1,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uy63p1/russia_is_losing_its_most_elite_troops_thanks_to/ia24o6i/,1653569268,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653540456.0,

You can't give what you literally don't have. There's not much ""dragging of heels"" going on. There's just actually no material to send to Ukraine on a short notice.  
Germany essentially de-militarized itself after the fall of the Soviet Union. The German army chief literally said on February 25 that Germany is ""standing around naked"".

And I also think that you pin that too much on the German *government*. The government is democratically elected and is supposed to act according to the will of the people. The German population is *still* fed up with war after almost 80 years; the disaster in Afghanistan didn't help either. Any involvement in the war in Ukraine, especially arms shipments, isn't actually *that* popular. Depending on how exactly you ask the question and when in the news cycle, you'll see aproval between 40% and 70%. And that wouldn't be any different in an alternate universe where CDU won the last election and Armin Laschet was chancellor. The largest group in the electorate is boomers and they grew up in a world where there was absolute certainty that Germany just would be glassed if it ever came to a war between NATO and the Soviet Union. That fear is still stuck in a lot of heads.  
Then there's also a significant number of people with a strict anti-German mindset that go on and on about that Germany should face the historical responsibility and that German weapons should ideally not exist, but at least never ever kill anyone ever for no reason whatsoever.

I know that it's very frustrating to watch from the outside - it's even more frustrating to watch from the inside - but the government actually is pushing the window of opportunity to the very edge.

But the reality is grim. As of today, there is not enough UA forces on any part of the front to launch a meaningful counter attack. And there is not enough arms. And the allies, although being vocal about their support, do not provide needed qualities of heavy arms.

Ukraine got new arty? True. And it's great news. But it's only been like couple of batteries - certainly not enough yet. Russia has 2000 arty pieces deployed, allegedly. There's been an interview with one Ukrainian commander deployed in Severodonetsk - where Russians are actively advancing currently - and he told that they can do nothing but slowly retreat, abandoning their positions one after another. And that's because the Russians simply bomb everything to ashes with arty and aerial strikes, so that there is no cover or structures to defend. And for one Ukrainian artillery shot Russians perform 50. If considerably more arty does not arrive in the nearest days, they'll have to give Severodonetsk up.

Ukraine got tons of NLAWs and Javelins? True. And it's also great news. But in reality, one needs to be in visual contact with a target in order to use those things.

&gt; May 25 - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Wednesday savaged suggestions that Kyiv give up territory and make concessions to end the war with Russia, saying the idea smacked of attempts to appease Nazi Germany in 1938.The angry comments by Zelenskiy and a senior aide come as Ukrainian troops are facing a renewed offensive in two eastern regions that Russian-speaking separatists seized part of in 2014.

&gt; Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comAnd former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger this week suggested at the World Economic Forum in Davos that Ukraine should let Russia keep Crimea, which it annexed in 2014.&amp;quot;Whatever the Russian state does, you will always find someone who says &amp;#039;Let&amp;#039;s take its interests into account&amp;#039;,&amp;quot; Zelenskiy said in a late night video address.

&gt; Earlier, in an expletive-filled tirade, Zelenskiy adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said some European nations clearly wanted Ukraine to make concessions to Putin.

I keep seeing people saying that even if there is a collapse and Russian nukes are lost that it isn’t that bad because the codes would probably be impossible to recover by whoever steals the nukes.

Do we really want to roll the dice on that scenario? Say a bunch of separatist republics spring up in the wake of a Russian collapse each with dozens or hundreds of nukes that can’t be armed. Do people honestly think they will just give them up to an international body or lock them away safely? No, they are going to be desperate for legitimacy and will use those nukes for leverage. Even if those new republics don’t have the capabilities to reverse engineer those nukes that doesn’t mean that aren’t going to sell them to another country who wants to give it a try. That doesn’t make the nuclear fuel any less potentially dangerous when North Korea or Iran make a secret deal to obtain it. It won’t reduce the risks of fallout from a dirty bomb detonated by a rogue terrorist group.

Absolutely none of this is meant to imply that Russia should be appeased in any way. The country is on its way to a collapse regardless of what the outside world does at this point. It also doesn’t mean that nukes likely weren’t already lost during the collapse of the Soviet Union. I just feel that people are underestimating the dangers involved in a complete and sudden collapse of Russia at this current point in time. Things are already destabilized worldwide due to the impacts of climate change and we are likely looking at widespread famines over the next decade.

First, the stuff that israel has sent is nice and greatly appreciated.  However, I just mention it's not enough.

The logic of the second part baffles me.  If as you claim, correctly, that Russia is Israel's indirect enemy, why wouldn't israel want to do all it can to fight it?   more to the point,  russia has been reported to have withdrawn forces from syria to fight in ukraine. 

""Russia is supplying Syria with air defense systems and weapons that can easily be pointed at Israel ""

Let's talk about the air defense systems first.

Russia has provided syria with older S-300s.  These are manned entirely by russians, I understand.  Moreover, not once have they been fired at IDF aircraft.  While they are not ""nothing"", the reality is that Israeli weapons are very capable of destroying these if they were ever put into action.  And, again, Russia would well need to withdraw these to Ukraine if Ukraine had more weapons.

Next, ""weapons that can be pointed at israel.""  What russia has supplied to syria itself (rather than using in conjunction with syria in attacks on idlib, etc) has been very basic stuff.  Can you imagine a scenario where somehow, in the middle of the ukraine war, russia can suddenly spare more high tech weapons for direct transfer to syria?  i can't.

the reality is that more capable russian weapons in the region have been under russia's tight control.  it would basicaly require russia to directly attack israel for them to be used. this clearly is not happening.

so i think you have it backwards.  i think you should be thinking in terms of ""defeat russia there so we dont have to defeat russia here.""  

and when the US makes a specific request for one specific weapon for israel to donate, it is a very bad look when they decline.  again, let's be really clear about this:  israel's defense capabilities are ENORMOUS in proportion to actual current threats, which is why they have faced no significant military threat since 1973.",462cda5856c7cb1fdb34480f27e8cb61b21e3ff5,True,False,,,,,0,1653560052,,0,{},ia1qgb1,False,t3_uxwg20,False,True,t1_ia1poy1,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uxwg20/israel_rejects_us_request_to_approve_missile/ia1qgb1/,1653560066,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653531252.0,

Many people struggled and could never extinguish the debt even up to 1917. But some were very good and were able to pay off their debt quickly.

After the civil war (1922), Lenin realized the newly created Soviet Union can’t feed itself, so he created the “new economic program” or NEP. It was actually a form of capitalism. The Kulaks were allowed to earn profit from the sale of their crops. It was a boom in the 20s, and Russia was able to quickly return to pre ww1 production levels.

TLDR: According to a german state secretary all NATO countries decided that western main battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicle should not be devlivered to ukraine.

T-72 are not western, Caesars and Panzerhaubitzen are neither main battle tanks nor infantry fighting vehicles.

However, it looks like the only source is Siemtje Möller, a ""state secretary of the parliament in the ministry of defence"" - whatever that means.

A day or two ago I saw a post here regarding danish piranha being delivered to ukraine. This was very interesting to me, since it is a western infantry fighting vehicle (like Marder). Getting some verification on this would be awesome.

That is why I'm not sure if this NATO agreement actually exists. It also wouldn't be the first case of state secretary blatantly lying to the german public. Just look up no spy agreement ronald pofalla.

And here are some real sources (everything in german sorry, but those seem to be the original sources).

However, the sad reality is that right now, Ukraine has no credible prospect of making a serious counterattack to reclaim territory and if they did, the russians would reply asymmetrically with missile attacks on large ukrainian cities.   Yes, some weaponry from the US is coming - but it's hard to see it being enough given that in terms of manpower, Ukraine is starting to dig into its untrained reserves while Russia's meat well runs deep.  Ukraine holds no cards of its own:  its military forces are on the back foot, and its economy is in tatters.  It is entirely dependent on support from the west - support that is wavering as realpolitik rears its ugly head.

If i got it correct, kissinger proposed ceding donetsk and luhansk oblasts.   unfortunately, the reality is that russia is in a position to take kherson and most of zaporizha too as it now stand - again, with very little that Ukraine can do about it militarily.

can we hope for miracles?   sure.   but those people who chanted 'kerson is ukraine' are long gone from the region in one way or another.  meanwhile, i spend too much time in this subreddit quarreling with idiots who are making excuse after excuse as to why their country (hello germany!  hello israel!  hello czechia!  hello france denmark netherlands etc etc etc) that they have some interest in doesn't need to help more and why can't the US just do it or at least pay for it?

this is the sad reality.   i think in a couple of weeks or months we may see zelensky make a very difficult speech that will see him branded a traitor by many.  my guess is that it will be

* end of hostilities
* 4 oblasts (or most of 4 oblasts) basically to russia
* ukraine 'neutral' status.  however, also a UN military force on the ground in Ukraine manned by NATO personnel acting as a further deterrent.
* the lifting of many sanctions on russia in exchange for certain economic concessions (odessa port routes open).

unless there is a realistic hope for a miracle, i think ukraine will have to take this. again, this is awful, but you can't conjure up a counterattack force from thin air and russia has every advantage militarily in terms of short logistic lines and manpower plus occupied populations who will quickly adapt to their new overlords.

and, to be clear, ukraine might still win militarily.  its not entirely impossible. things can happen.  the future is uncertain... but also realistically ukraine could still lose it all, including kyiv and beyond.",216b818fb328038ce5a3386f493d2ad4156a9f4b,True,False,,,,,0,1653557291,,0,{},ia1n8jq,False,t3_uy3enz,False,False,t3_uy3enz,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uy3enz/kissinger_calls_to_cede_to_russia_akin_to_1930s/ia1n8jq/,1653557306,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653528491.0,

&gt; ended up after the collapse of the USSR with a bunch of nukes but gave them up because among other things they could **only** be used to target far range ie 10,000km away

Now, if I google for what nuclear weapons Ukranine used to have, I found at https://gaz.wiki/wiki/de/Nuclear_weapons_and_Ukraine this text:

&gt; 130 UR-100N Interkontinentalraketen (ICBM) mit jeweils sechs Sprengköpfen, 46 RT-23 Molodets Interkontinentalraketen mit jeweils zehn Sprengköpfen sowie 33 schwere Bomber mit insgesamt ca. 1.700 Sprengköpfen verblieben auf ukrainischem Territorium.

The last sentence says ""33 heavy bombers with a total of 1700 war heads stayed on ukrainian territory"". So I think what you wrote isn't correct. Ukraine was too dump or too corrupt to defend itself. And they have zero reasons to now blame Germany on this, as if Germany is the source of all their troubles. If anything, the source of all troubles is Russia. And then their own decisions in history. Period.

Now, why didn't i mention these details before?  Because people also forget the details when they accuse Germany. Or when they suddenly Germany to have an attack-able armed forced. E.g. the simple detail that in 1989 most european countries were scared about a unified Germany. And so in the 2+4 treaty it was codified that the Germany army should be reduced and stay small.

The Federal Republic of Germany always had **only** a defense force. We never brought our military up to be an attack force, contrary to e.g. USA, Russia, China, partially UK and France due to their ""areas of influence"" like Falklands, Gibraltar or Franco-Afrique. If you say we neglected our army too much, I'd agree. But if you say that we should have a similar amount of weapons like the USA, then you're very misguided. An attack army MUST have at least 3 times amount of weapons than a defense forest. Germany can fulfill it's NATO duties (e.g. we provide currently 1/4th of the NATO crisis forces), but barely more.

So, if the usual Reddit armchair general can ignore background info for the sake of accusing Germany ... I can do this as well. In any case, that Ukraine back then was so corrupt was still Ukraine's fault, not Germany's.

&gt; USA, the UK, Northern Ireland and ironically Russia

Northern Ireland isn't a country, what you say makes no sense. Is that a typo? https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapester_Memorandum doesn't mention Ireland.

Still, we can clearly see that Russia failed the Ukraine. We again cannot see that Germany failed the Ukraine.

Also, in a way it's then just natural that USA and UK are at place #1 and #2 when it comes to aiding Ukraine in this mess. Still doesn't give you or Ukraine the right to constantly trample onto Germany ... which is at place #3 when it comes to aiding Ukraine.",8d180e58cea59e4b6e582133ba65b4d6244b2c29,True,False,,,,,0,1653554286,,0,{},ia1jw3y,False,t3_uxolle,False,True,t1_ia1i3ua,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uxolle/reuters_tanks_but_no_ammo_germanys_ukraine/ia1jw3y/,1653554301,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653525486.0,

&gt;Bullshit.  Israel has done below what would be expected of a country with a serious principled commitment to tackling genocidal fascism. Far, far, far less.  

&amp;#x200B;

Few countries in Europe do not have this commitment.

&gt;And then to deny a specific small request from the USA.  

&amp;#x200B;

It was not a request from the US. If the US had requested it, I am sure Israel would do it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;AS somebody else pointed out, the russian voting bloc in israel is unfortunately real and popular.

&amp;#x200B;

Mmmmm  
Approximately one-third of the Russian Jews came from Russia, one-third from Ukraine, and the rest span the former Soviet empire’s geography from Central Asia to the Caucasus, Belarus, Moldova, and the Baltics.   
I am not sure how this affects their voting and their feelings on this issue.   
About 76% of the population supported the Ukrainians, but only 10% expressed support for the Russian side. Then there are the Arab voters in Israel, whose support for Ukraine is about 41% for the Ukrainians. Then there are Arabs under Palestinian control in PA and HAMAS in Gaza; both the PA and HAMAS support Russia. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Ukraine needs planes and no one not even the US is giving them that.""  
&gt;  
&gt;FIrst, this is far from certain.  Maybe Ukraine could benefit from more CAS aircraft (A-10 like or more Su25s from ancient stocks from the few countries who still have them), but only maybe.  Russia has pretty good defenses against them even if they were given.  Ukraine does not particularly need more 4th generation fighters as evidenced by the fact that they keep most of theirs on the ground most of the time.  What plane, specifically, do you see it worthwhile to give to Ukraine and that can help realistically in the short to medium term?   How do you know ukrainian pilots aren't off somewhere getting training that you don't know about on plausible but marginally useful types like F-15C and old block F-16s?   I'm guessing (and i say this as somebody who knows my way around a military aircraft or two), that you are speaking generically about 'aircraft' with no actual knowledge.  Even if Ukraine had pilots trained on F35 and F22 right now and plenty of those aircraft, it is unclear how that would really tip things (though obviously those would help to some degree).

Well, no fighters are going to Ukraine.",f2c2ef7db3a16b05afb8c3c4ef72c0d5251c40c5,True,False,,,,,0,1653554065,,0,{},ia1jn8a,False,t3_uxwg20,False,True,t1_ia1fz0f,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uxwg20/israel_rejects_us_request_to_approve_missile/ia1jn8a/,1653554076,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653525265.0,

Consider the history of Jews with Ukraine.

Bohdan Khmelnytsky - a Ukrainian hero - massacred 300,00 Jews.

During WWII Ukrainians murdered hundreds of thousand of Jews before, during and after the Nazis invaded their country.

Ukraine consistently voted against Israel in the UN. 

There is little love lost between them.

Despite all that, Israel still sent them a state-of-the-art field hospital along with doctors and other experts at a cost of millions of dollars. They have sent them other aid, some publicly known, some inferred from other situations.

When it comes to arms, just about every argument trotted out here is based on an ignorance of the situation on the ground.

When Hamas fired 4,500 missiles in the most recent conflict with Israel many of those were either supplied by Iran or manufactured with technical assistance from Iran. Hezbollah has 100,000 missiles of which many if not most of them were supplied by Iran. Both Hamas and Hezbollah have openly declared on multiple occasions that they intend to destroy Israel.

The Russian factor is simply that they are present in Syria, and Israel requires their cooperation to operate against Iranian proxies in the region. Without that cooperation every operation Israel carries out becomes far more risky and complex. Israel cannot afford to get into a shooting match the Russians right now, despite the horrific situation in Ukraine.

We are not going to stand and watch how old Europe is unwilling to help Ukraine. 
No, Lithuanians are going to buy Bayraktar for Ukraine. 
BAYRAKTAR – the dagger in the night, the horror of Russian army. Armed with bombs and rockets, sending fiery and deadly wishes to the invaders. 
Never did people of one country decide to buy a heavy war machine in order to defend another country.
Until now. 
Lithuanians are buying Bayraktar for Ukraine, and we are on the march! 
We need 5 million euro. 
It is a staggering sum, but in less than 24 hours we have already raised more than 1.6 million euro. 
Lithuania is united. Everybody chips in – government ministers and nurses, famous singers and students, businessmen and teachers. 
Even kids are taking out their savings and asking parents to transfer them to Bayraktar instead of buying Fortnite skins. 
The Hunt for Bayraktar is green lighted by Lithuanian and Turkish Ministries of Defense and Bayraktar makers. 
Crowdfunding is run by independent internet TV „Liberty TV“ (Laisves TV). We are completely legit and transparent, we have raised 2.5 million euro for Covid relief, already bought thousands of vests, helmets and two modern recon drones for Ukraine, organized „Freedom Way“ to support Belarus. We are the sword of public action in Lithuania. 
People of the world – come join us. 
As King Theoden of Rohan said before the final battle at Helm‘s Deep in „Lord of the Rings“ - Let this be the hour when we draw swords together. Fell deeds awake! Now for wrath, now for ruin, and the red dawn!

Putin was directly involved in Russia's negotiations to attempt to join NATO. Putin is fully aware that NATO is a defensive and largely peace oriented organization. When Putin claims there was a promise NATO would not expand he's directly and straightforwardly lying to your face because around the time he pretends the promise was made to Russia he himself knows Russia was trying to expand NATO.

Given this, Putin's only fear of NATO expansion is because he fears it will restrict his future ability to invade other countries. Even if you are a friend of Ukraine, if you help the counterfactual information to spread then you are causing serious damage to them and you should understand if, even if wrong, some of them feel you support Putin.

There is nothing in this article that says this.

Rather, the outlook as stated or implied in the article, is much, much more bleak for Ukraine.   Basically, the article says that Russia has about 9 months to win ALL of ukraine.  The idea that if russia doesn't do X in 9 months or Ukraine will take back all of its territories is simply not true.  Rather, they imply that in 9 months ukraine will have trained its reserves enough to coherently stall further russian advance.

The sad fact is that as of right now, the best Ukraine can hope for is a stalemate on existing lines.  Again, barring a miracle, something like a serious counterattack just isn't happening, unfortunately.

No, I am referencing an aid tracker YOU linked further up in this thread. Sorry for not knowing you had magicallly changed the goalposts to some other source

&gt;There are numerous articles about how Germany imported fossil fuels and also cheap Russian raw materials to the exclusion of the rest of the Eurozone to fuel their industry.  The German teet suckling is far wider than just fossil fuels but I know you won't acknowledge this.  
&gt;  
&gt;Buying stuff = teat suckling, gotcha. It spells with an a, by the way.

Just read an article or two. It will really help you. There are numerous articles about how Germany has cosied up to Russia to the exclusion of other EU nations to drive it's heavy industry. And yes, a simple spelling mistake is the most important thing to focus on, if we are playing that game...""It's spelled with an a, by the way"".

&gt;Did I mention that the contents of the aid matters more than the amount apparently given?  
&gt;  
&gt;Yeah, you did, a few times. It’s still bullshit.

It's really not. Only you think it's bullshit because it blows your argument out the water. 

&gt;Under intense international pressure they cave and change, how noble and great of them /s

First of all you have to understand that those conscripts don't actually want to fight, but are trapped by a bureaucratic machine.

It's very compartementalized. If DNR soldiers are sent to Mariupol - which is part of Donezk Oblast - that's a procedurally correct order. You were conscripted to ""liberate"" DNR, Mariupol is in territory claimed by DNR, so you go into ""war mode"". This ""war mode"" does include atrocities, but that's actually beside the point. Refusing to participate there is a violation of military discipline, insubordination, whatever. It gets you branded as a traitor and possibly executed.  
If however the same conscripts are told to go fight in the LNR that - procedurally - doesn't make any sense. DNR isn't at war with LNR and I'd be surprised if they are officially, with publicly available documents that can be referenced, in a military alliance. So you can't switch into ""war mode"". So the conscripts - who don't actually want to be in a war - point that out. Because they know that they can do so safely. They're not in insubordination. Quite the opposite, they're basically beating on the drum of: ""We want to follow lawful orders, these orders aren't lawful!"" (And again, it doesn't really matter if the orders are lawful from an external frame of reference, they just have to be consistent with the internal rules.)

Similar things are happening all over Russia. Russia hasn't officially declared war on anyone and the government carefully avoids the word ""war"". Which means that - officially - Russia is at peace. Which in turn means that any contract soldier can simply hand in his proverbial two-weeks-notice and leave the military. There were several police units that were sheduled to be deployed in Ukraine that just stood there saying: ""We can't go to another country. We don't have passports."" And that worked.

Right, because the bulk of western europe has chronically, chronically underspent on their defense commitments as per nato guidelines.  basically a crime against peace, in the final analysis.

""and can face the anger of Russia.""

Utter bullshit.  NATO.  QED.

""There is much more than minimum here, in fact much more here than many European countries on the front line that are bigger and richer.""

Bullshit.  Israel has done below what would be expected of a country with a serious principled commitment to tackling genocidal fascism. Far, far, far less.  And then to deny a specific small request from the USA.  AS somebody else pointed out, the russian voting bloc in israel is unfortunately real and popular.

""Ukraine needs planes and no one not even the US is giving them that.""

FIrst, this is far from certain.  Maybe Ukraine could benefit from more CAS aircraft (A-10 like), but only maybe.  Russia has pretty good defenses against them even if they were given.  Ukraine does not particularly need more 4th generation fighters as evidenced by the fact that they keep most of theirs on the ground most of the time.

There are zero Gepards in the german armed forces since about 15 years. Not even in depots. Germany, the state, have jo use for ammunition.

IMHO a modern manpad is more capable than a Gepard for anti-air, minus the missing Radar- this might e the reason the german army outphased them in the first place.

Ukraine didn't buy these Gepards from the german state, but from a private company (Krauss-Maffei-Wagner). With money donated by the German state, thought. But the money wasn't donated specifically for Gepards, UA is free to use the 1 billion for anything.

Germany even warned them to not get this weapon, it's complicated and maintenance intensive.

In my book UA ambassador Melnyk didn't do his job. He was surprised the Gepards are old (based on Leo 1 chassis}. He didn't listen to warnings.

But in Belokhorovke, a tiny coal mining town on the banks of the Seversky Donets River, the tables were turned earlier this month, at least temporarily slowing the Russian advance.

Ukrainian soldiers who fought in the battle took to calling the site “the ear” for a lobe-like loop in the river where the fiercest fighting took place. The Ukrainian military escorted reporters for The New York Times to the site, which is on a frontline formed in much of the Donbas region by the roiling, fast-flowing river, swollen by spring rain.

Sunlight filters through the foliage of a dense, quiet forest on the river’s floodplain, which was the Ukrainians’ kill zone. Mosquitoes buzz. In places, the smell of decaying corpses is overwhelming.

“The Russian bodies start here,” Private Sichkar said as he rounded a bend in a dirt road extending about mile through the forest to the river’s edge. Just in this one spot, 15 incinerated armored personnel carriers were scattered about.

“The Russians wanted some little victory,” Col. Dmytro Kashenko, the Ukrainian officer who commanded the counterattack on the pontoon bridge, said in an interview. “They tried in Kyiv, they tried in Kharkiv, and they lost. They were trying to win at least something.”

The Seversky Donets River, which cuts a meandering path through eastern Ukraine, forms a natural barrier to Russia’s advances. Suitable sites for pontoon crossings are few, Colonel Kashenko said.
Russia-Ukraine War: Key Developments
Card 1 of 3

On the ground. Moscow’s military has narrowed its focus to a 75-mile-wide sliver of land in the heart of the eastern Donbas region, which has allowed Russian forces to make incremental gains. Russia’s main immediate target remains Sievierodonetsk, the easternmost city still under Ukrainian control.

A global threat. The president of the European Commission accused Moscow of deliberately trying to provoke a global food crisis by targeting grain warehouses, ports and other critical infrastructure in Ukraine, one of the world’s most important food exporters.

NATO expansion. Delegations from Finland and Sweden are in Turkey to meet with officials in an effort to address President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s opposition to the Nordic nations’ bids to join NATO. Ahead of the talks, Turkey made a series of security-related demands of Sweden.

He was ordered to one of the crossings on May 8, after the Russians deployed pontoons and moved soldiers into the forest on the near bank. Ukrainian infantry advanced into the area the next day, but were repulsed, suffering losses, he said.

They then set up a defensive line to box in the Russians as they crossed their pontoon bridge, and rained down artillery fire on the area. They also set about destroying the bridge by placing floating mines upstream, allowing the current to carry them to the Russians’ pontoons, which proved an effective tactic. The Ukrainian forces blew up four separate bridges at the crossing site.

The Russians hastily laid new pontoons and sent armored vehicles across, Colonel Kashenko said, but they were unable to break through the Ukrainian defensive line. Dozens of armored vehicles and infantry soldiers became trapped and were mauled by Ukrainian artillery. The Ukrainians also hit Russian troops involved in the bridge work on the far shore.

The bombardment included some of the first barrages from a newly arrived American artillery gun, the M777, Colonel Kashenko said.

Colonel Kashenko said he had offered the enemy forces a chance to surrender, shouting into a loudspeaker, “‘Russians, give up!’” But, he said, “I don’t know if they heard us.”

Some enemy soldiers escaped by swimming across the river, the Ukrainians said. The Ukrainians have yet to collect the remains of the Russians scattered around the forest.

In the mottled light sifting through the leaves, discarded food and personal items lay all about: a sleeping bag, bottles of shower gel, cans of beef, a bag of potatoes, Russian tea bags, flip-flop sandals.

Ukrainian soldiers found a certificate for a medal granted to a Russian colonel for earlier fighting in the war. It was called an “award for military excellence.”

Beside a disabled Russian tank lay a cardboard box apparently used for carrying supplies. On the box was an odd message for a unit in war: “Always believe something wonderful is about to happen.”

Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, former supreme allied commander in Europe, drew a distinction between the Ukrainian tactics of seeking to target Russian armored vehicles and troops with artillery and the Russian bombardments of towns and cities.

“In the big scheme of things, Ukraine is trying to do maneuver warfare to regain territory and cut off resupply routes,” General Breedlove said. “And Russia is doing more of a grinding, attrition-based warfare.”

Of Russia’s bungled pontoon crossing, he said, “the Russians did something poorly that is difficult even if you do it magnificently.”

A Doomed River Crossing Shows the Perils of Entrapment in the War’s East

Encirclement is a tactic used by both sides in the war between Russia and Ukraine, but it can carry big risks.

    May 25, 2022

BELOKHOROVKE, Ukraine — Out on the riverbank, the scene of mayhem unfolded under a baking spring sun: blown-up tanks, the detritus of pontoon bridges, heaps of branches shorn off by explosions and the bodies of Russian soldiers, some half buried in the mud.

In the forest, a short walk revealed bits of torn Russian military uniforms hanging from trees, an eerie reminder of the troops who died violently here.

The failed river crossing that took place at this spot over several days in early May was one of the most lethal engagements of the war for the Russian army. Its forces had sought to surround Ukrainian soldiers in the nearby town of Sievierodonetsk — but instead became surrounded themselves, boxed in by the river and a Ukrainian frontline. At least 400 Russian soldiers died, mostly from artillery attacks.

As the war grinds across the rolling plains and forests of Eastern Ukraine, the maneuvering of troops has in large part evolved into attempts at entrapment. But as the deadly encounter at the bridge illustrated, the tactic comes with grave risks.


After failing to capture major cities such as Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, or to cleave off the entire Black Sea coast, the Russian military attempted a major encirclement of Ukrainian troops in the east. That effort is looking difficult now that Ukraine has blocked one main route of advance, near the town of Izyum.

So the Russian forces’ immediate goal has become a smaller encirclement of Sievierodonetsk, the easternmost city in the Donbas region still under Ukrainian control. Artillery bombardments by Russian troops approaching from three sides have ravaged the city, knocking out water and electricity and in the past day killing at least six people.

The Russian strategy has been to use the blunt instrument of its army’s vast artillery to pound away at Ukrainian forces, making incremental gains in the Luhansk region of the Donbas. Military analysts and Western intelligence officials believe that Moscow’s forces would face brutal urban combat if they tried to fully capture Sievierodonetsk, and that they would struggle to mount an offensive deeper inside Ukraine.

Encirclement is a harrowing prospect for soldiers.

“I try not to think about it,” said Pvt. Ivan Sichkar, a Ukrainian soldier surveying the destruction of the encircled Russian force. “If I think of being surrounded, there’s no time left to do anything else.”

The Russians’ refashioned goal has focused the battle on a slender, 75-mile front in the Donbas. It is seeking to advance from both the north and the south to close the one remaining supply line for Ukraine into the city of Sievierodonetsk.

On Tuesday, the Russian army advanced from the south, forcing Ukrainian troops to retreat from the small town of Svitlodarsk, lest the Russians envelop the town and trap soldiers inside. And in its Wednesday evening briefing, the Ukrainian general staff described stepped-up attacks by Russian helicopters and jets to support ground troops in the east.

With Russia making only halting progress in Ukraine, President Vladimir V. Putin moved Wednesday to shore up support at home, announcing raises in pensions and the minimum wage and making his first trip to meet with wounded soldiers. “They are all heroes,” he said at a military hospital.

Mr. Putin also signed a decree opening a fast track to Russian citizenship for Ukrainian residents of areas controlled by the Russian military, a further step toward annexing territory in southeastern Ukraine that Russia has occupied.

As Mr. Putin moved to reassure ordinary Russians, Ukraine’s Western allies were trying to maintain pressure on his government. In Ankara on Wednesday, talks took place between Turkey, Finland and Sweden over Turkish concerns about the two Nordic countries’ application to join NATO. At a news conference after five hours of negotiations, Ibrahim Kalin, a spokesman for Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said more talks were needed.

“Turkey is not under time pressure,” Mr. Kalin said. “It is not possible for any process to proceed without meeting the security concerns of Turkey.”

The strategy of encirclement has yielded far-reaching political gains for Russia over the course of its longer conflict in the region, in which Russian-backed separatists battled Ukrainian forces for eight years before the full-scale invasion this year. Two cease-fires, known as the Minsk agreements and seen as struck on terms advantageous to Russia, followed successful Russian encirclements of Ukrainian troops in the east in 2014 and 2015.",0b5cefef11e4ca6b74611d2024897e752d0c813b,True,False,,,,,0,1653544946,,0,{},ia18uov,False,t3_uxz1tz,False,True,t1_ia0zfwr,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uxz1tz/a_doomed_river_crossing_shows_the_perils_of/ia18uov/,1653544959,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653516146.0,

The only reasonable, logical, and just end is Russia recognizing Ukraine's borders, retreating, and engaging in actual diplomacy rather than grunted threats.

I'm not asking for the death of Ukrainians, I'm asking for Russia to end their campaign, as is being demanded by the Ukrainian people. Russia is at fault and their belligerence is their own fault. Russia started this war in an act of avarice and no one should argue for rewarding rapists and war criminals with victory in the name of ""peace"" that would be anything other than peace.

The discussion of nuclear arms use is entirely their own and is the action of a tyrannical, fascist Russia that requires a manufactured war to drive attention away from their failed state status.

Again, your point is to reward Russia for invading and threatening nuclear war by telling Ukraine it's their fault for being such a tempting target. That's abhorrent, and I'm done with this conversation. I'm not going to discuss anymore the merits of Russia's crazed violence cloaked in Kissinger-ian peace because that, like Kissinger, is a fraud and intellectually, morally, and ethically bankrupt.

The West is very bold and imprudent , to involve a nation in an adversarial military alliance on Russia’s border , especially with the possibility of Russia looking down the barrels of nuclear weapons placed there . That’s my main point .  I think that people today perhaps don’t realize how incredibly fortunate the world has been to escape to date the explosion of nuclear bombs .  To put that in perspective, I must say that it has been an absolute miracle ( no exaggeration ) that no nukes have gone off to date .

This is a huge deal on its own.   Unless a disaster happens, Ukraine's coming out of this into one hell of a boom, and what we're going to see in the next few decades is a very vibrant eastern europe — basically what's going to happen to them is rather similar to what happened to japan/korea post ww2, or to the nordic countries.

&gt;That said, I don't think current Ukraine is strong enough to beat Russia up THAT badly. I would gladly be proven wrong, but I would be okay if Russia just fucks off even without falling apart.

Most likely outcome IMO is Ukraine's gonna chase Russia to the borders, and expel them from their territory.   This will come at a bitter cost of blood and tears, but I believe they're willing to do it.   It's possible Russia will just absolutely run themselves ragged attempting to stop this, or it's possible Putin gets whacked, and someone more sensible (but still a chauvinistic FSB imperialist) cuts their losses and cedes the territory.

Russia at this point will be a pariah, outside the bounds of normal international ""moral"" law.

This is *extremely* analogous to Mossad agents hunting and killing former Nazis that fled to south america.   They killed with impunity, and the international community looked at it and was like ""yeah, no worries, those guys totally had it coming.""

Most likely we'll be looking at some of the serious ""war criminals who walked away with impunity"" getting quietly offed, but the much more interesting geopolitical angle is that all of the ""covert ops that destabilized nearby countries"" that russia's been doing for years?

4883,[],False,,IrrationalPoise,,,[],,,,text,t2_hhvep9n5,False,False,"Well first off there isn't any 3's of 12's. All standard inch units are at halves of each other. 1/2 \* 1/2= 1/4. 1/4\* 1/2= 1/8. When you get something like 3/8"" you literally made division a counting exercise. If I need to halve that subdivision further it's literally just 3/8 \* 1/2 = 3/16. Literally, it's just multiplying by 2 until you arrive at the scale you need. The decimalizing is just completing the division, 1/8 = .125, 3/8=.375. You do need to divide in metric and functionally division is the same thing as a fraction. In addition the SI (metric) measure of angle is actually fractions of pi in the form of π/2=90 degrees, π/4=45 degrees, 2π=360 degrees. There are actually several competing efforts to metricize measures of angle and they're all fractional. They're all pretty obscure too because apparently everyone who is used to metric doesn't understand the concept of fractions.

Second, when you change the from quarter inches to eighths you're literally only changing the segment you're working with at the time. Not the scale of the project. So if I take 29' 4-21/64"" and decide that's not quite right and need to add a 64th the new measure is 29' 4-22/64"" if I decide I can't get into tolerance at that scale the new measure is 29' 4-23/128"". If I need to divide the overall length into an arbitrary number of sections I can convert feet back into inches and distribute the remainder (4-22/64"") throughout. so 352-22/64 inches divided into four sections become four equal sections of 88-23/128"" need three sections, then it is three equal sections of 117-21/32"" Seven? 50-79/128"" or 4' 2-79/128"". In the real world 50-10/16"" would probably be what you went with. You'd only be around 198 micrometers or \~1/5 of a mm off

You do that in millimeter ands you end up with three equal sections of 2,983 mm, which is cool. Divide it into 4 and you end up with 2,237.25 mm or 2,237 1/4 mm, or 2,237,250 micrometers. Seven, \~1,278.429 or \~1,278,429 micrometers. 

Third, when you switch between meters, centimeters, and millimeters you're changing the scale by an order of magnitude. You are literally doing nothing but changing the scale by a multiple of 10, and it's the entire projects. To give you a little background I used to do structural steel work, and when I'd start seeing .1 behind my millimeter calculations it would drive me nuts because you only get about four of those before they start building up to an interference problem where you'd either fall short or go over the space you had to work with in a way that was structurally significant so you'd have to do a bunch of 7 digit number calculations several times over to make sure you weren't going to screw up anything whereas if you're working with American customary units you can just come up with 10/16"" plop it in every section and see if it works. If it's too long try 9/16"", too short, try 11/16. 

In metric no one really even tries to do things like that because it's really complicated so what they'll do is change the overall scope of things to make the numbers easier to work with. To give a real world example I once drove myself nuts trying to get a prefab stairwell right in metric and when I saw what it was replacing the people who did it before me had made the landing narrow enough that it was awkward to use, and added a trip you up step in front of a door to make the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the stairs work out evenly. I haven't done a lot of metric projects but on all but one I ended up with a ""Oh, these lazy assholes!"" moment because of something like that. In the years since I've learned that's actually pretty standard in countries using metric, and I'm pretty sure it's because there isn't a quick easy way to scale up and down, or distribute remainders.",d9afa4057df5693eaf2a54a16f573a8244b66117,True,False,,,,,0,1653540312,,0,{},ia12dgq,False,t3_uwx6hp,False,True,t1_ia0hjhu,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uwx6hp/russian_sailors_stage_mutiny_and_refuse_to_carry/ia12dgq/,1653540323,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653511512.0,

civilian fatalities in ware of usually referred to as ""collateral damage""; but that doesn't really apply in this war does it? Putin and his generals deliberately targeted civilians--their flats, hospitals, schools; they mine roads and direct escaping Ukrainian civilians to those roads. They publicly announce their intention to destroy a city and then they target the civilian railways stations to maim and kill those trying to flee. And they do this with the most horrific kind of munitions--the kind designed more to cause permanent suffering and disfigurement rather than death. And of course these are mostly women and children; most of the men except the very young and the very old have joined the Ukrainian army or a territorial defense unit 

the number of Ukrainian civilians who have lost their lives in this war far exceeds the number of Ukrainian soldiers killed. This is no accident. Indeed, it's very strange behaviour for an invading force that claims to be liberators

but this is what the russians do--they did it Chechnya; they did it in Syria; they did it in Georgia, and they are doing it just now in Ukraine

as we have seen over the past 90 days, RF are not particularly skilled, or courageous soldiers. They routinely abandon expensive and hard-to-replace equipment on the battlefield and run away to save their own lives

they never retrieve their wounded or dead when they retreat--whether it's because they are preoccupied carrying property they pillaged from the Ukrainian village from which they're fleeing or because they only think of themselves, i have no idea

RF treatment of the Ukrainian civilian population is a level of depravity i honestly didn't know even existed apart from a minuscule population of serial killers, extreme sociopaths, etc. And yet in the RF, this hyperbolic behaviour is accepted and encouraged. The entire unit from Buca was given given an award from Putin

the Ukrainians are a peaceful people; even the Ukrainian ""ultra-nationalists"" wish only for the integrity of Ukrainian borders. But these peaceful Ukrainians remember what RF have done to Ukrainian families--their own wives and children--and it motivates them every minute of every day to destroy every RF soldier on Ukrainian land. 

do not expect the Ukrainians to ever stop fighting--not while even a single RF soldier is in Ukraine. Do not expect them to compromise--eg, by ceding Luhansk, Donetsk, or especially Crimea. 

as the ware progresses, RF are clearly getting weaker--both in equipment and in bodies to operate that equipment. The Ukrainians are killing *over 300 RF soldiers per day* (not including another triple-digit number of wounded and unaccounted for). The Ukrainians are destroying or capturing about 12 RF tanks per day. 

for russia, replacements of both soldiers and equipment are worse than the original. The T-90 and T-72 tanks with which russia began this war, are being replaced with much older T-64s.

by contrast, the US lend-lease program has been enacted to law which will ensure a rapid and steady pipeline of advanced lethal weapons to Ukraine for as long as Ukraine needs them",b67c94e91d056e9f336bcc6216f665184c51f9f1,True,False,,,,,0,1653540068,,0,{},ia1201q,False,t3_uxytdf,False,True,t3_uxytdf,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uxytdf/the_last_family_photo_in_mariupol_the_beginning/ia1201q/,1653540081,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653511268.0,

That is staggering considering this has been happing for what, since 2010-2012ish?

When did the blackmail payments to Chechnya begin?

That is what it is, Chechens blackmailing Russia.

Has it been worth the $10+ billion? They certainly didn’t get much in terms of fighters from Chechnya other than the militia(s).

I suppose the real gem to them is the fact that true Wahhabism did not really spread after the Kadyrov militia took power.  

Not to say there isn’t a presence there, however without Wahhabism taking hold, there isn’t much in terms of a true Islamic independent Chechnya movement to overpower the kadyrov militia as it stands now.

I don’t know where to stand on Chechnya.  As a teenager I supported Chechens during the first war and second war (supported in the sense of agreement) however it became impossible after September 11th, the theatre hostage attack and the school hostage attack.

However… it’s hard not to make the connection between the bombings of Grozny, the deaths of many Chechen children and the radicalization that came from the carpet bombings of civilians in Chechnya.

Killing children is never acceptable.  Had they focused on attacking Russian military and government targets, there would have been an audience to entertain support of Chechnya (even after September 11th).  

The attack on the school is exactly what Russia has done now in Ukraine.  

So support for Chechnya will be difficult unless a movement can be created that does not involve players from that time period who attacked the school.

I think support for a modern independent Chechnya can be fostered and should be fostered as this will create turmoil within Russia.

We haven’t discussed the loss in numbers of Kadyrov Chechen forces and what type of operational state they truly are in.

With them being in Ukraine, coupled with their total deaths so far in Ukraine, I imagine they are stretched thin in Chechnya in terms of the militia.

Perhaps with funding from the Middle East (S.A.) a group could be raised to at least start engaging in fighting with them.

A civil war in Chechnya would be a disaster for Russia right now.

5071,[],False,,LordVericrat,,,[],,,,text,t2_38tmnehe,False,False,"&gt;we need a universal bill of human rights for the free world. Current international law is so convoluted and wishy washy, we need a more solid platform to rebuild things upon after they fall apart for the millionth time.

But who would enforce this universal bill of human rights/stronger international law?

Because the way I see it (and I hope you see it better than me!) we have two main categories of options for that. First would be to create a world government, which would have control over some sort of violence (like a military or police force) that could make people and/or polities comply with international law. Second would be to...well, not. So world government or no. Let's tackle the latter first.

We're already living in a no-world government world. Human rights are enforced either by states voluntarily complying, or by being forced to comply by other states. Voluntary compliance is part of what creates the soft wishy washy shit you don't like, so we need to enforce more often. Maybe some international agreement could bind a group of countries (eg NATO, but probably something broader) to intervene whenever a human rights violation is found.

This approach of course has issues. A main one would be that the enforcing countries would almost certainly exempt themselves from enforcement. If any country was too important in the enforcement mechanism (coughUScough) they could violate human rights with impunity. Also, smaller, less developed, and overlooked countries would likely be the main targets of enforcement, and that's in what I'd view as a best case scenario. More likely, places with exploitable (by the enforcer states) resources become targets for the smallest of offenses while larger or less exploitable countries get long investigations that never seem to turn into anything but low level sanctions.

I hope there's a better way to do it in a no-world government world, one that I'm just missing. But I just don't trust a coalition to do it right. Still I hope there's a way because I don't much like the alternative.

A world government terrifies me. Almost certainly that comes at least partly from a position of privilege. As an American, I don't have to worry much about non-American forces telling me what I can and can't do. Smaller, less influential countries who already live in a world where they de facto have to consider how other countries feel probably don't have as great an aversion to the idea of a world government. Still...

Let's just consider one spectrum of political opinions, the security/freedom tradeoff. I think some places have such serious security concerns that they legitimately make a different decision on that spectrum than I would think is appropriate. If, for instance, parts of Ukraine are under martial law because they are close to the front or have just been liberated (by Ukranian forces, not a Russian apologist here), then that's probably necessary for awhile, but if Nashville, Tennessee does the same, it's very much not ok.

And some places might just make a different decision than me. If the murder rate is 1 in a hundred thousand (as in the UK), I might think the amount of policing we need is x but you think it's x+5 or 3x or x². Because maybe you value security/freedom tradeoffs differently than I do. And it's difficult to say you're wrong and I'm right or vice versa. After all there is a human cost to murder, but I think the human cost to over-security is more concerning at a 1/100000 murder rate. But if the murder rate was 1/1000, I might think we need 10 times the security we currently have, while you might value freedom even more than I do, so you think a slight increase in security is all that's necessary. Which of us is wrong, and who's to decide that?

Which all comes back to this - I'm sorry but cultural differences in how we answer that question (and remember that's only *one* political question about tradeoffs) are definitely important and if, say, China and India formed a bloc (an ass pull example that I'm not judging the likelihood of), I don't necessarily want them to be able to answer political questions for me. Presuming a democratic government, take a look at the valeriepieris circle and understand that all decisions could be made by just that subset of humanity. 

And to the racist chuds out there thinking they agree with me because I don't want brown people making all the decisions, no, I'm brown myself. This group is no more or less worthy than any other group. I just think how they feel about certain political questions (eg my security freedom tradeoff question) might be right for them (or not) but not me.

So a world government that had a monopoly on violence so they could enforce international law is something I'm very wary of. And, apparently, I like to type.

I don't know why to be more surprised: because the SBU leadership finally returned to Kyiv, because in February and early March, when Kyiv was under threat of occupation, they were somewhere in Transcarpathia…

Is it more surprising that the SBU has so much time for the case of 2014, and somehow does not notice the current collaborators - neither the deputy Kovalev from the servants, who is now scratching himself well in occupied Kherson, nor another Kovalev from the group Trust, who tells Russian cameras how ""humanely Russians treat"" prisoners from Azovstal.

And this new parliamentary group of cynics ""For the Restoration of Ukraine"", made by fugitive fugitive Stolar from the Ozzh and other quilters, who until recently on camera hugged in the State Duma with Russian ""colleagues"", somehow the SBU is not interested. There are no cases against them. None.

There are cases of people who in 2014 were able to miraculously hold the country and build our modern army, which today defends Ukraine. Launched missile programs, closed the production cycle, which exists in only 8 countries. They developed the VilhuM missile system with a range of 120 km. According to people who have done something that has not been a priority for the government for the last three years. According to people who are in all possible sanctions and execution lists of Russians and are their direct enemies.

Maybe the SBU has finally dealt not with Russia's enemies, but with its friends? Or gunners to barracks, training centers for our soldiers and trains with them? And the SBU counterintelligence would do something with the concentration of people in one territory? Because the number of non-combat losses from shelling in Yavoriv, ​​Desna, Malyn, Zaporizhia region is hundreds and hundreds of the best…. And it's such a pain…

No, they need politics…

The war is not over. Heavy territorial losses lie ahead. And human… If the country's secret service is currently shooting and editing videos with prompters, that's something wrong. Not at all.

I hope that the SBU will respond to the call of Alexander Turchinov and go to the trenches in the Kherson region. Not so long ago, a mine hit right in the trench. The machine gun and machine gun were torn to pieces. The soldier survived because he miraculously went to the toilet… Maybe, after seeing in the trenches, which are fired on every half an hour, the SBU will finally understand the reality in which Ukraine lives…

I received information from the media today about the inadequate political PR of the Security Service.

Namely, a summons to summon me for questioning as a witness was posted on the SBU website almost a week ago.

I want to inform the ""heroic"" investigators that I am on the south-eastern front and ready to answer any questions in one of the trenches.",0383f6bd9be5a1d21df167e993625a7b2f1f036a,True,False,,,,,0,1653535241,,0,{},ia0tvio,True,t3_uxyd0v,False,True,t3_uxyd0v,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uxyd0v/does_the_sbu_have_a_lot_of_free_time/ia0tvio/,1653535253,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653506441.0,

There is a lot of denial in this Sub but there are certain realities at play here.

All these facts are from a linked article in The Nation magazine, a liberal Democratic bible. Additionally I’ll put some video links from western sources too:

Andriy Biletsky who was a deputy to Parliament, once wrote that Ukraine’s mission is to “lead the White Races of the world in a final crusade…against the Semite-led Untermenschen.” Not some fringe skin head, he’s part of the parliament. A lot of people have to agree with him or at the very least not be totally disgusted by him, in order for him to attain such a political position.

In the fall of 2014, Azov, founded by Biletsky, which is accused of human-rights abuses, including torture, by Human Rights Watch and the United Nations—was incorporated into Ukraine’s National Guard, making Ukraine the only army in the world with a known neo Nazi formation as part of their military.

Speaker of Parliament Andriy Parubiy cofounded and led two neo-Nazi organizations: the Social-National Party of Ukraine (later renamed Svoboda), and Patriot of Ukraine, whose members would eventually form the core of Azov.

In 2015, the Ukrainian parliament passed legislation making two WWII paramilitaries—the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA)—heroes of Ukraine, and made it a criminal offense to deny their heroism. The OUN had collaborated with the Nazis and participated in the Holocaust, while the UPA slaughtered thousands of Jews and 70,000-100,000 Poles on their own volition.

The government-funded Ukrainian Institute of National Memory is institutionalizing the whitewashing of Nazi collaborators. Last summer, the Ukrainian parliament featured an exhibit commemorating the OUN’s 1941 proclamation of cooperation with the Third Reich

Last year, the Israeli government’s annual report on anti-Semitism heavily featured Ukraine, which had more incidents than all post-Soviet states combined. The World Jewish Congress, the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, and 57 members of the US Congress all vociferously condemned Kiev’s Nazi glorification and the concomitant anti-Semitism.

Those are all very troubling facts and you simply cannot blame Israel here.

“Henry Kissinger may be the most overrated public figure of our times. He is overrated, first, by some foreign policy jocks, who wrongly credit him with being the mastermind behind Nixon’s foreign policy achievements.”

“In fact, Nixon drove his own foreign policy and very much wanted to open relations with China and achieve détente with the Soviet Union. Nixon was the grand strategist, Kissinger the tactician. (Those achievements, moreover, are counterbalanced by Nixon’s needless prolongation of the Vietnam War.)”

South Asian policy was definitely Kissinger’s nemesis that left a sad, a problematic legacy.

Here is Gary Bass on the issue:

“In at least one crucial part of the world, Kissinger’s legacy is fixed: In South Asia, Indians and Bangladeshis widely remember Kissinger as an unusually cruel and cold-hearted person.”

“As they bitterly recall, he and Richard Nixon firmly supported Pakistan’s military dictatorship throughout its bloody crackdown in 1971 on what today is Bangladesh, sending some 10 million Bengali refugees fleeing into India. In one of the worst atrocities of the Cold War, Pakistan’s junta brushed aside the results of a democratic election, killed awful numbers of Bengalis and targeted the Hindu minority among the Bengalis.”

“On the White House tapes, Kissinger sneered at Americans who “bleed” for “the dying Bengalis.” 

“Kissinger’s actions in 1971 were clouded by his own ignorance about South Asia, his emotional misjudgments and his stoking of Nixon’s racism toward Indians. Kissinger’s policies were not only morally flawed but also disastrous as Cold War strategy.”",167c08c17beecc335b6cf991e34c1b682e7e38ae,True,False,,,,,0,1653529507,,0,{},ia0hyca,True,t3_uxucca,False,True,t1_ia0d8ll,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uxucca/zelensky_says_ukraine_will_fight_until_it_regains/ia0hyca/,1653529524,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653500707.0,

Here is Niall Ferguson’s analysis:

“Was he a war criminal? I am afraid that by the standards some of his critics have applied to Kissinger numerous post-1945 U.S. statesmen could be accused of crimes against humanity (and that applies perhaps to the vast majority of modern great powers’ leaders).”

“What the archival record has so far revealed is that Kissinger was often simplistic, binary and even uninformed during his tenure as national security adviser and secretary of state. His often broadcasted realism notwithstanding, he tended to adhere to a dogmatic, zero-sum-game of the international game.”

“In short, he wasn’t a war criminal, he wasn’t a very deep or sophisticated thinker, he rarely challenged the intellectual vogues of the time (even because it would have meant to challenge those in power, something he always was—and still is—reluctant to do), and once in government he displayed a certain intellectual laziness vis-à-vis the intricacies and complexities of a world that he still tended to see in black-and-white.”",61eed49140b9bf45a43ca4f44302fa61da9afdb0,True,False,,,,,0,1653528871,,0,{},ia0gkdr,True,t3_uxucca,False,True,t1_ia084jt,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uxucca/zelensky_says_ukraine_will_fight_until_it_regains/ia0gkdr/,1653528886,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653500071.0,

“But he was a man of ideas at the center of an American strategy that ultimately benefited the world in some grand sense. His China policy was one of America’s great Cold War achievements. He deserves to be honored and to be given a medal—but one with the image of a man who is scowling and holding a knife.

- Z in particular and to an extent V are notable not only for tanks, but for the propaganda and symbol worship around them, the rest of the marks are not singled out so much. Also very odd (for them) to use Latin and not Cyrillic or something else not associated with their ""enemies"" for ""their"" sign.
- Also the explanations like denoting ""areas"", ""units"", ""avoiding friendly fire"" do sound reasonable and might be true, but doesn't help my trust that as far as I've seen such explanations originate from Russian sources (Russian Channel One, Life.ru and even Tsargrad - owned by Malofeev, and where that same Dugin is chief editor), and for instance Aric Toler from Bellingcat said no idea what ""Z"" meant.

- That was more like a question raised on a highly suspicious observation, with some circumstantial evidence (that probably makes more sense to those who already know a lot about Dugin though).

But, back to the T62....in your theoretical scenario of using them from a block away....all Russian tank designs of the Cold War have a serious issue with gun elevation, which is a *problem* in urban warfare, especially if your tactic is driving up the tank and shooting at point blank range essentially.   This means it can't shoot at anyone above it, and the T62s armor is vulnerable to any shoulder fired rocket built since the 1960s.

This stuff going on in Sverdonetsk?   This is probably where Russia's army breaks.  Russia's currently taking *horrendous* losses — this part isn't really a matter of optimism or pessimism; the absolute bare minimum, confirmed-by-photo-evidence depictions of their equipment losses are something that hyperbole doesn't do justice.  To put it in perspective, as of this week, *Russia has started rolling out T-62s because they're exhausting their supply of T-72 tanks.*

What I anticipate happening is that Russia will take Sverdonetsk, and may get past the rivers into the hills there, but that's where they ""culminate"".   That's it.   They'll keep fighting there, and keep shoveling in men, and keep dying in heaps.  That's why there's no threat to Odessa — the only reason Russia's made progress there is by literally abandoning all other ""simultaneous efforts"", and focusing the entire fighting force of its military in one place.   Kherson (where they'd be going from to assault Odessa) is now defended by as few soldiers as they can get away with without losing it.  If they were going to push to there from Sverdonetsk, at the rate they're going, just to get 1/3 of the way to Odessa, Russia would have to lose another 200,000 men.  It's madness.

Today it is estimated they lost something like 400-500 men.  An entire battalion tactical group EVERY DAY.  Russia slated 200-ish for this invasion.   Ukraine's losing something like 30-100 men per day.  Russia has a very large army, but at a rate of 1 BTG *per day*, they're going to exhaust that within half a year (and actually their burn rate is a bit higher, since they've lost something like 2/3 of what they put in so far).

&amp;#x200B;

The more damning thing is the equipment.   Russia will have lost most of its meaningful equipment in about 2-6 months.   It will take a while, but they have no means to replace this.  Once it's gone, it's just gone.  Because the equipment differential is swinging in Ukraine's favor, it means that the casualty differential is going to get much worse (for Russia) over time.

To illustrate how bad it is, even if we were just holding to the current casualty rate, if Putin were to somehow draft the entire living population of Russia, it would lose its entire population before Ukraine ran out.   It's *that bad.*

Like the last Tsar, an absolute autocrat is allowed to pursue incredibly stupid ideas ... temporarily, at least.

Fortunately for us rooting for Ukraine; the way that modern warfare works, you can't actually do this.  The purpose of almost all modern weapons tech, since the days of WW1, has been to make WW1-style dig-ins impossible.   In a scenario where Russia is out of modern weaponry, and Ukraine isn't, those poor guys who've trenched in just die in their trenches.  Slowly, perhaps, but they die, and they die in a really one-sided way that favors the side with modern kit.

If you wonder why Ukraine is constantly begging for new, modern weapons, this is a key reason why.",17b3844eef8e9f1576c60017c45d3a80805337ca,True,False,,,,,0,1653527291,,0,{},ia0d3uj,False,t3_uxj3y8,False,True,t1_i9zh6vz,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uxj3y8/russia_only_has_resources_for_12_months_of_a/ia0d3uj/,1653527309,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653498491.0,

Ukraine is using small ambush teams mostly, and engaging in lots of urban combat or using artillery to kill tanks. 

The T-62 is just as useless at combatting this as the T-72A and B and is just as good at being an infantry support tank. It's not very good in that role being a shitty tank to begin with, but it has a cannon and some machine guns so it's better than nothing. 

Really at this point, we've gone so far down the ladder it doesn't even matter if they pull out the T-54/55. Nothing below a T-72B obr. 1989 is adequate for engaging Ukrainian armor, all are highly vulnerable to artillery. Nothing changes unless they get knocked down to like a T-34-85. 

They're going with the strategy of ""just overwhelm them with more armor"". Which totally can work if youre fighting someone small, who has a tough time killing armor. A la, Chechnya. But this isn't that war, the Ukrainians have javelins and lots of artillery. So really...

&gt; United News was initially aired by five channels owned by various Ukrainian oligarchs as well as the publicly owned channels.

&gt; &amp;quot;It helps protect Ukrainians from Russian fakes and prevents panic among the population.In 2014, Russian propagandists and their allies released a barrage of disinformation about the Maidan revolution, Crimea and events in eastern Ukraine that experts said worked to destabilise the country.There are also more practical reasons for the channels working together.&amp;quot;Most of the journalists left Kyiv and the channels simply could not cope individually,&amp;quot; Ostapa said.

&gt; Since May, Ukrainians looking for an alternative to news can tune in to other channels that show films and cartoons about good winning out against evil.
