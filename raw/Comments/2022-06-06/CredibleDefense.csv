The thing is, reading between the lines, it's pretty clear that this guy (Ghairat Baheer) was basically the kind of Al Quaeda-adjacent figure that they were supposed to be grabbing - I mean, he's a militia commander, not an 'innocent' of any variety. 

The unfortunate flip side is that, in 2014, the US realised he was probably one of the few people in Afghanistan that represented a quorum of people who actually wanted the Afghanistani state to exist in some kind of centralized form, and had the muscle to back that vision up.

In a way, it's a kind of instructive example about why torture is such a bad idea: the short-term value of potential intelligence almost never outweighs the long term effects of making it political death for people to be seen in the same room as you. 

I had no idea about the ISIS-prison-gang connection. In a way, it's unsurprising: Hamas is essentially the Gaza prison gang, so I can imagine a lot of cross-polenization. I imagine it's also an inherently radicalizing environment.

There is in general a big question mark over the actual usefulness of prisons, even in the best case scenario, and it's actually been a question since they started being a thing, in early modernity.

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"&gt;The use of torture by US and allied forces was a very public issue in the early years of the war on terror,

The stuff you're referring to wasn't against the Taliban, that was Al Qaeda operatives rounded up in Afghanistan in 2001-2 and elsewhere, who ended up in Gitmo or other countries to do third party interrogations (we outsourced most actual torture). 

You bring up American torture of detainees which is interesting because the US cracked down so hard on detainee ops in the mid 2000s after Abu Ghraib scandal and all the torture headlines that it effectively destroyed our detainee ops capabilities. Guards and security wore such kid gloves for fear of getting in trouble that they lost control of the actual detention centers. The detainees ran them similar to a poorly run Mexican prison, with the actual hardcore insurgent groups being in charge instead of drug cartels. I had buddies who did security at Camp Bucca in Iraq, riots were weekly and they needed to go in hard in platoon strength firing nonlethals just to do basic stuff inside the wire. It was insane. Afghanistan was similar.

In fact, ISIS was basically a prison gang. All their leaders, go look up their history. Nearly everyone of them was a former detainee. They weren't radicalized in those places, they were educated there.  Al Qaeda in Iraq operatives took control of the detainee centers in the mid 2000s after the US lost discipline, they enforced Sharia law including trials and executions, recruited and networked, compared notes on effective tactics, techniques and procedures, they literally turned those camps into the Iraqi University of Insurgency, with different campuses like Camp Bucca, then we let them all out in 2009-10. 

The issues in the American run Afghan detention centers was near identical to Iraq, a mix of who was detained (often innocent got rounded up among guilty), the duration of their detention (no trials for most, so it was hard for actual innocents to get released), and the overall poor quality of the detention. 

Not surprising, America has historically sucked at detainee operations, going back to the American Civil War all the way to the GWOT. We never commit enough resources to do it right, our policies suck, supervision is shit, and the field commanders ignore all that while continuously taking more detainees to dump them. American society and the jail and prison system isn't much better. 

When it comes to Afghans running camps, they obviously did things differently than us. We didn't control them or have the ability to make them do things one way or another.

[],False,,VideConspectus,,,[],,,,text,t2_ftzys,False,False,"China’s navy is already the world’s largest by numbers of vessels. The U.S. Navy has 297 battle-force ships — carriers, destroyers, submarines, etc. — according to the Congressional Research Service, while China has 355 and is projected to have 460 by 2030, according to last year’s Pentagon report.

But, said Andrew Erickson, research director of the China Maritime Studies Institute at the Naval War College, “as impressive as those numbers are, without a significant network of robust overseas facilities, their ability to use them falls off rapidly with distance from China.”

China is nowhere close to matching the network of military bases the United States has around the world, a major U.S. military and strategic advantage, said Richard Fontaine, chief executive of the Center for a New American Security. But, he said, a base in Cambodia “gives them a force-projection capability that they would otherwise not have in the region. That’s intrinsic to the Chinese aspiration of having a more dominant military presence throughout the Asian rimland and in the South China Sea, allowing Beijing to hold at risk — and have political influence over — countries quite far from the Chinese shore.”

Djibouti was a logical first step for a military outpost in that it is in a region far from China in which Beijing wants to have a presence, in this case to secure its growing Middle Eastern energy interests, Erickson said. Also, the United States, France and Japan have long had military bases there, he noted. “The question then becomes, how do you start filling out the board?”

Cambodia is “a no-brainer” in that Hun Sen, prime minister since 1985, is “extremely amenable,” Erickson said, noting that the Cambodian leader has had a long strategic partnership with Beijing.

“But the problem is Cambodia is a small country in a tough spot,” he said. “It’s trying to have it both ways: maximum strategic collaboration with China with minimum regional pushback. That contradiction is going to be exposed by the undeniable development of this facility.”

China also has reportedly sought to establish a facility in the UAE. Last year, U.S. intelligence agencies learned that Beijing was secretly building a military installation at a port in near the Emirati capital of Abu Dhabi, the Wall Street Journal reported. After meetings and visits by U.S. officials, construction was halted, the Journal reported. The current status of the project is unclear.

China’s secret building of a Cambodian base “resembles the playbook” it used in reclaiming and militarizing the Spratly Islands in the disputed South China Sea beginning in 2015, said Eric Sayers, a former adviser to the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command who is now a nonresident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. “It started quietly,” he said, “with Beijing claiming its building of artificial islands on coral reefs and atolls was for peaceful purposes and promising the features would not be militarized. Then when it was far too late, we saw permanent and irreversible militarization.”

He said he expected to see the trend also play out in the Solomon Islands, a South Pacific nation that recently signed a security agreement with China. In April, after a draft copy of the agreement was leaked on social media, Beijing confirmed the pact, which neither government has released. According to the leaked copy, China will be permitted to send armed police and military personnel to the Solomon Islands to help maintain order. The government there has denied it would lead to China establishing a military base.

But Western officials are skeptical. “There’s evidence that China is developing plans and has sent technical teams to the Solomons to explore possibilities for basing facilities that would contradict some of the assurances that the government has made to allied governments,” a third Western official said.

China fails on Pacific pact, but still seeks to boost regional influence

The Solomons agreement is part of a broader Chinese effort — not always successful — to build influence in the region. Last week, China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, completed a 10-day tour of the South Pacific but failed to achieve a desired 11-nation pact on security and development. Instead of repeating the Solomons diplomatic coup, China’s proposal was shelved at a meeting in Fiji, after some countries questioned whether the deal would spark greater confrontation between China and rivals in the region.

But it would be a mistake to take the rebuff of Wang as a sign that Beijing’s influence is waning, the third official said. “There is a relentless quality to what the Chinese are involved in and they’re just going to keep coming. So anyone who thinks this is a signal that they’ve been blunted or blocked, that’s not accurate.”",f54303a790510fc249ddc2ab0d8e7ba6a218ce12,True,False,,,,,0,1654553026,,0,{},ibf27w9,False,t3_v61vzb,False,True,t1_ibf278c,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v61vzb/weekly_questions_and_comments_thread/ibf27w9/,1654553041,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654524226.0

China is secretly building a naval facility in Cambodia for the exclusive use of its military, with both countries denying that is the case and taking extraordinary measures to conceal the operation, Western officials said.

The military presence will be on the northern portion of Cambodia’s Ream Naval Base on the Gulf of Thailand, which is slated to be the site of a groundbreaking ceremony this week, according to the officials, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the matter’s sensitivity.

The establishment of a Chinese naval base in Cambodia — only its second such overseas outpost and its first in the strategically significant Indo-Pacific region — is part of Beijing’s strategy to build a network of military facilities around the world in support of its aspirations to become a true global power, the officials said.

China’s only other foreign military base right now is a naval facility in the East African country of Djibouti. Having a facility capable of hosting large naval vessels to the west of the South China Sea would be an important element of China’s ambition to expand its influence in the region and would strengthen its presence near key Southeast Asian sea lanes, officials and analysts said.

“We assess that the Indo-Pacific is an important piece for China’s leaders, who see the Indo-Pacific as China’s rightful and historic sphere of influence,” one Western official said. “They view China’s rise there as part of a global trend toward a multipolar world where major powers more forcefully assert their interests in their perceived sphere of influence.”

Beijing, the official said, is banking on the region being “unwilling or unable to challenge China’s core interests,” and through a combination of coercion, punishment and inducements in the diplomatic, economic and military realms, believes it can get countries to bend to its interests. “Essentially, China wants to become so powerful that the region will give in to China’s leadership rather than face the consequences [for not doing so],” the official said.

The Wall Street Journal reported in 2019 that China had signed a secret agreement to allow its military to use the base, citing U.S. and allied officials familiar with the matter. Beijing and Phnom Penh denied the report, with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen denouncing it as “fake news.” A Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman at the time also denounced what it called “rumors” and said China had merely been helping with military training and logistical equipment.

Over the weekend, however, a Chinese official in Beijing confirmed to The Washington Post that “a portion of the base” will be used by “the Chinese military.” The official denied it was for “exclusive” use by the military, saying that scientists would also use the facility. The official added that the Chinese are not involved in any activities on the Cambodian portion of the base.

The official said the groundbreaking, scheduled for Thursday, was taking place and that Chinese officials would attend. The Chinese ambassador to Cambodia is expected to be present.

Asked for comment, the Cambodian Embassy in Washington said in a statement that it “strongly disagrees with the content and meaning of the report as it is a baseless accusation motivated to negatively frame Cambodia’s image.” It added that Cambodia “firmly adheres” to the nation’s constitution, which does not permit foreign military bases or presence on Cambodian soil. “The renovation of the base serves solely to strengthen the Cambodian naval capacities to protect its maritime integrity and combat maritime crimes including illegal fishing,” the statement said.

China’s Foreign Affairs Ministry did not reply to a request for comment.

The Western officials said they expect there will be an acknowledgment at the ceremony of Chinese involvement in financing and construction of the expansion of Ream Naval Base, but not of plans for its use by the People’s Liberation Army. The expansion plans were finalized in 2020, and, significantly, called for the Chinese military to have “exclusive use of the northern portion of the base, while their presence would remain concealed,” a second official said.

The two governments have taken pains to mask the presence of the Chinese military at Ream, the official said. For instance, foreign delegations visiting the base are permitted access only to preapproved locations. During these visits, Chinese military personnel at the base wear uniforms similar to their Cambodian counterparts’ or no uniform at all to avoid suspicion from outside observers, the official said. When Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman visited the base during a trip to the region last year, her movements were “very heavily circumscribed,” the official said.

While she was in Cambodia, Sherman sought clarification over Cambodia’s razing in 2020 of two U.S.-funded facilities on Ream Naval Base, according to a State Department news release. The demolition took place after Cambodia declined a U.S. offer to pay to renovate one of them, according to a Pentagon report on Chinese military developments last year. That move, the report said, “suggests that Cambodia may have instead accepted assistance from the [People’s Republic of China] to develop the base.”

“What we’ve seen is over time is a very clear and consistent pattern of trying to obfuscate and hide both the end goal as well as the extent of Chinese military involvement,” the second official said. “The key thing here is the [PLA’s] exclusive use of the facility and having a unilateral military base in another country.”

Last year, the “Joint Vietnamese Friendship” building, a facility built by the Vietnamese, was relocated off Ream Naval Base to avert conflicts with Chinese military personnel, the officials said. China and Vietnam have long had a tense relationship, with Hanoi and Beijing clashing over competing territorial claims in the South China Sea for half a century.

The secrecy around the base appears to be driven primarily by Cambodian sensitivities and concern about a domestic backlash, the second official said. There is strong domestic opposition to the idea of a foreign military base, said the official, noting the constitutional ban on the presence of foreign military in the country. As the chair of the 10-member regional Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) this year, Cambodia is keen to avoid the perception it is, as the second official said, “a pawn” of Beijing.

Cambodia has been walking a fine line between accommodating and distancing itself from Beijing. It was an “enthusiastic supporter” of the U.S.-ASEAN special summit in Washington last month, the second official said. In March, it joined 140 other countries in voting at the U.N. General Assembly to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Beijing abstained from the vote and has publicly affirmed a “no limits” partnership with Moscow that includes opposing further NATO enlargement. At the same time, Chinese influence in Cambodia has grown rapidly in recent years, with China providing substantial aid and investment, a trend that has also caused some concern in Phnom Penh about overreliance on Beijing.

Beyond its base in Djibouti, opened in 2017, Beijing is pursuing military facilities to support “naval, air, ground, cyber, and space power projection,” the Pentagon report said. It has “likely considered a number of countries,” it said, listing more than a dozen, including Cambodia, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Tanzania and the United Arab Emirates. A global network could “both interfere with U.S. military operations and support offensive operations against the United States,” the report said.

The report also said that Chinese military academics have asserted that such bases can enable deployment of military forces in theater, and intelligence monitoring of the U.S. military.

The Chinese official told The Post that ground station technology for a BeiDou navigation satellite system was located at the Chinese portion of Ream Naval Base. BeiDou is China’s homegrown alternative to the U.S. Space Force-managed Global Positioning System, and has military uses including missile guidance. The official did not have direct knowledge of how this system was being used.

China’s military uses BeiDou’s high-accuracy positioning and navigation services to facilitate force movements and precision-guided munitions delivery, according to a March report by the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency.

China’s global basing effort is “not just about power projection but about global tracking and space assets,” said a third Western official. Cambodia’s Ream is “one of their most ambitious efforts to date.”",d210d4149c5c82a687268aa48e4edba0eac34650,True,False,,,,,0,1654553017,,0,{},ibf278c,False,t3_v61vzb,False,True,t3_v61vzb,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v61vzb/weekly_questions_and_comments_thread/ibf278c/,1654553033,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654524217.0

------------------

&gt; * But if surprise means going first, states or alliances of states need to do two things: act pre-emptively and keep the surprise secret. They also need to be prepared for failure and able to absorb the consequences.

&gt; * Can democracies or multilateral organisations surprise anymore, given the need for consensus, debate and transparency? Can a decision taken collectively ever be a revelation? More specifically, is this possible currently in a Western state, or in complex alliances such as NATO or the EU? Is it now the case that surprises happen to the West rather than the other way around?

&gt; * We in the West have become so unused to taking the initiative that we are fearful and mistrustful of our actions when we do.

&gt; * The one who acts first sets the time and place and forces the opponent to choose whether to escalate or not. The advantage can be lasting.

&gt; * On the question of pre-emptive strikes, it states that: ‘There is no rule in law to say that a person must wait to be struck first before they may defend themselves.’ And on the question of reasonable force, it states that: ‘A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances for the purposes of (in the alternative) self defence, defence of another, defence of property, prevention of crime, and lawful arrest.’ Prevention of crime strongly implies acting before the crime is committed. 

&gt; * The principle of acting in anticipatory self-defence formed the legal basis for pre-emptive disruptive action taken by the US and its allies against Islamist terrorist groups…

&gt; * Ironically therefore the argument for anticipatory self-defence in the case of Ukraine has been used by Russia to justify the invasion, but was not used by the West to deter an invasion. 

&gt; * It could be argued that the Russian troop build-up on the border of Ukraine passed the point of becoming an imminent threat in the second half of 2021. There doesn’t seem to have been any serious consideration of the threshold for anticipatory self-defence.

[],False,,passabagi,,,[],,,,text,t2_82a7volb,False,False,"&gt; Purposeful use of terrorism backfires at least as often as it works.

This is kind of what has been sticking with me, though. I was listening to an interview with an Afghani academic, a kind of hipster-looking guy by the name of Obaidullah Baheer, as the Taliban were taking over Kabul. 

He said he thought that the problem was that the Americans, and their Afghanistani allies, had simply tortured way too many people in the process of their COIN campaign for them to form a viable coalition without the Americans propping it up. 

I looked up his name (he was quite critical of the Taliban, which seemed either suicidal, or indicative of some kind of connections), and it turns out he's the son of one Ghairat Baheer, who was held in extrajudicial detention for six years. The funny thing was, in 2012, the US started trying to pull this guy into the orbit of the Afghan government, since wasn't Taleban, and he was exactly the kind of guy who could probably prop up the government in a pinch. He turned them down, and now he's part of the Taleban's government.

So there are two things: first, the use of terror by the American and Afghani forces obviously backfired in this specific case, but did it backfire more generally? It seems likely to me, at least, that arresting and torturing many regional leaders and powerbrokers in Afghanistan would have made them a lot of durable enemies, and as far as I can understand, that's essentially what the Afghan state and the US did.

Second, why is this never part of the conversation amongst even analysts? The use of torture by US and allied forces was a very public issue in the early years of the war on terror, but it was never framed in the way this Afghani dude seemed to see it, as the hinge on which the whole enterprise failed. 

It seems that western media either does sentimental hand wringing about this sort of thing, or just pretends it doesn't happen. There's never a really frank conversation about how brutality is employed, when it fails, and when it succeeds. It's never really written into the broader strokes of the story about what went wrong in Afghanistan, or Iraq, even though I absolutely bet it played a *huge* role, not only in the perception of the US, but also in the personal feelings of the elites they had to woo to create durable states.",8c1e390c2c3bdb285f4dda0195a08aeeb44ee98f,True,False,,,,,0,1654548353,,0,{},iberue7,False,t3_v61vzb,False,True,t1_ibenp1k,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v61vzb/weekly_questions_and_comments_thread/iberue7/,1654548369,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654519553.0

It took one day after Nagasaki and while three of the Big Six still wanted to fight on versus three wanting to end the war, the atomic bombs were enough to break the morale of the one person in Japan whose opinion mattered most but who previously refused to give this opinion publicly to his ministers: Hirohito.

&gt;This moved Japanese leadership towards thinking even extracting a conditional surrender may no longer be possible.

Not according to the recorded minutes of their meetings, surviving letters, and postwar interviews/interrogations. 

The Soviet declaration of war was disturbing especially to the three pro-peace members of the Big Six who had been wanting to use them to try to win a peace deal on positive conditions (including bribing the USSR with giving them Manchuria in exchange to keep China and remaining possessions in the Pacific if the USSR could pressure the US to concede). But they had already planned around the invasion of Manchuria beforehand, the army defending it had already been severely reduced in size to defend the Home Islands, and the existing garrison had already been given orders to fall back to the defendable mountainous areas of northern Korea, which was one reason why the Red Army advanced so quickly.

What the Japanese had been hedging all their bets on was Operation Ketsu-Go, the ""porcupine defense"" of the Home Islands against the US that was intended to be so bloody and horrible that they were willing to lose upwards of 20 million of their own people in exchange for bloodying the US enough to seek a peace deal. That same defense would have worked against the Red Army too, more so, as they had very poor to nonexistent amphibious capabilities. But the atomic bombs made an invasion totally unnecessary, and they couldn't defend against it. Unlike the firebombing they couldn't revamp firefighting procedures or evacuate people to less flammable areas in the rural areas.

For example it's hard to extrapolate the number of human casualties from the lost equipment. If a tank has been destroyed, did it have a crew in it? If it's moving then yes, otherwise, it's unclear. Let's say it's moving, do we know for sure if the crew got out or not? If it didn't get out, are they all dead or not? 

In some cases when it's a moving tank, that's shot at and immediately the turret flies away, it's clear that the crew died. But the vast majority of cases are not that clear. It's even harder with an APC because you don't know how many people are inside.

On the other hand it's completely unclear how many infantry soldiers die outside the vehicles, in the trenches or attacking tenches.

Then you have the Western, Ukrainian and Russian estimates. Nobody knows what methodology the Western agencies use for estimating casualties. We can't just assume, they have the guy in the General Staff updating them every day. Ukraine of course, like any other country will inflate the number of enemy casualties. Russia, naturally, will deflate. In fact you may remember how the Moskva cruiser casualties included a large number of MIA who obviously were actually KIA.

Somebody mentioned the DPR ombudsman, that may be an accurate source, but it's just a small part of the overall force. So how do you extrapolate, especially since the LDPR forces are used in some of the riskiest meatgrinders such as Mariupol and now Severodonetsk (LPR 2nd corps and Rosgvardia is engaged there).

Then you have to consider how many are taken out of action due to wounds or sickness or other reasons. What percentage of these are recoverable casualties. There was a post by an LPR soldier that the wounded end up losing limbs because of not knowing how to apply the tourniquet. That's irrecoverable even though it should be.

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"&gt;That salient is begging to be encircled, and I don't know why the Russians didn't do that first before moving to take Severedonetsk.

You're right. Operationally there is absolutely no point in a large scale attack into urban strongholds like Severodonetsk or Lysychansk if those both automatically fall if they're encircled by pinching the salient off at the shoulders. They can't ignore the apex of the salient, they still have to threaten those areas enough that the Ukrainians can't shift defenders to mass elsewhere. But it's a total waste of manpower and resources to attack in strength to conduct a  unnecessary gruelling battle there while they don't have the resources to do it where it's really needed.

Two things. Russians are not obsessed with battles of encirclements, they're just as happy pushing the enemy out as cutting them off. And they're obsessed with broad front attacks. In theory, if each of the many axes are attacking hard, the defenders have to mass and fight hard everywhere to stop them. But because the defender can't, in theory, mass everywhere they can't be strong enough to stop the attack, so the line is broken locally. Because they are attacking on a broad front, those small breakthroughs happen multiple times, so the enemy's reserve is committed. They keep happening and then finally one or more of the breakthroughs can't be contained. At that point the operational maneuver group is committed and they drive deep to an operational target achieving decisive results. 

But to make broad front work the attacker must have an overwhelming advantage in manpower and fires, to the point that a battle of attrition greatly favors them. If the enemy doesn't commit its reserve, no breakthroughs can be exploited. If attacker doesn't have a overwhelming advantage in manpower and fires, no individual axis is strong enough to overwhelm the defenders. And that's what we're seeing here.  

[Look how spread out the Russians are are](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FUIKqaLXoAI_L-5?format=jpg&amp;name=large). If each of those BTGs was a brigade, broad front would work. But they didn't have the numbers. 

Hell, it's also possible that if the Russians massed in only a few obvious axes to create an encirclement then the UAF could also still have massed enough to stop them. Though I think the Russians would have had a better chance.

So this wasn't a new form of destruction that Japan had not experienced before.

It took Japanese leadership a couple days to fully ascertain what had happened, and even after the 2nd bomb, the majority position was to continue the war in the hopes of preserving the imperial government as part of the terms of surrender.

Another factor was the Soviets declaring they were ending the neutrality pact and invading Manchuria between the bombings. This moved Japanese leadership towards thinking even extracting a conditional surrender may no longer be possible.

In any case, historians argue over the details of this stuff, but the overall picture is a lot more contradictory than ""the bombs shocked Japan into surrendering.""

Of course it'll have an impact, see the Butterfly Effect. Firing just one magazine from an AK at the enemy has an impact on the war. So does one cruise missile.That doesn't make it meaningful to the outcome, especially when weighing cost vs reward. 

Not only does terror bombing have an effect, but it's rarely the intended one. It's devised to break morale and yet most times it does the opposite, it most often inflames and unites populaces more. 

There are only a few cases in modern history where terror bombing actually seemed to have worked and even those are questionable, namely the 1920 Iraqi Revolution that some claim caused the Iraqi tribes to capitulate (the major ground campaign is usually not brought up) and the 2004 Madrid bombing that caused an election upset that led to Spain quitting the Iraq War. But on the flip side, terror bombing was done extensively  in WW1, the Spanish Civil War, WW2 (minus atomic bombs), Korea, and various times in the Arab Israeli conflict, all failed to break morale and end the war. 

In fact, strategic bombing itself has never actually won a war, which since its birth to the present it's acolytes have sworn it can do.

If Russia actually wants to use bombers or cruise missiles to help, they should do it with targeting in mind that supports specific ground operations they need to succeed. Want to win in Donbas? How can deep strikes with bombers or missiles help? That's far more useful than them trying to win the war themselves with a separate strategic campaign, basically done in competition with ground campaigns instead of in a spirit of coordination and teamwork.",408f4da375ba9c3bcf5a15dd66f3f11d5bb9867c,True,False,,,,,0,1654541173,,0,{},ibebbf8,False,t3_v61vur,False,True,t1_ibdv4fr,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v61vur/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_06_2022/ibebbf8/,1654541184,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654512373.0

If he actually made Russia an efficient and wealthy autocracy with a gdp per capita like China  or even out did them and a system that could actually survive after he is dead or out of power..

I think that russsia would have had incredible soft power based on the fact that it’s more traditionalist.

A huge country with white European looking people that is more conservative, is anti-lgbt, anti- gay marriage and aligns a lot with what many factions in Europe and a large part of the USA feels?

We’re lucky putin is so incompetent, corruption and self destructive.

I just think a Russia with their cultural environment that has a powerhouse economy would be a huge problem.

Think of all the politicians that would be going there and saying “we need to be more like Russia” during the height of the reactionary rise after lgbt rights and also think about the refugee crisis and the terror attacks. There was such an extreme trend and pushback.

There’s a sizeable amount of people that  already,even with Russia with a gdp the size of Italy- worshipping the Russians and self flagellating and you can see them in the comment sections on videos of Russian army recruitment.

They totally fell for the propaganda and would say shit like “I’m an American and I’m mourning for my country all we care about is diversity and woke feelings and gay rights, heaven help us if the Russians ever clash with us”


I really think a modern conservative russia with wealth and prosperity would mean a 10x factor in the number of sympathisers and “useful idiots”.


I mean can you imagine if Russia had that wealth and also had no debt and a big “war chest” as we hear about in the media.

I really think we’d never have heard the end of it politicians giving over dramatic speeches saying “ our country is weak and divided and we have a huge deficit and all we care about are those *gay rights* and *inclusion* look at how Russia is doing they have huge reserves and they’re not blah blah culture”

I wonder so often how putin was the worst thing to happen to Russia, they’re basically the last empire yet still he wants more land and a union state with Belarus and Ukraine and to connect with transnistria and grab Abkhazia and South Ossetia- with success he may have moved onto Georgia proper. ( after doing Ukraine style billions in covert operations).


All he had to do to ensure Russia would truly have a rise would have been to make them rich and stable like China and he’d have had so many western sympathisers and people salivating over an alternative traditionalist society that has the image of America ( these same types see China as too different and oriental to do the same for them + the communist boogeyman).",b52a77de5a5e304d055e6d6019c6ccd1f21e0994,True,False,,,,,0,1654538256,,0,{},ibe4iwv,False,t3_v61vur,False,True,t1_ibdf5vo,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v61vur/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_06_2022/ibe4iwv/,1654538273,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654509456.0

Rail attacks isn't terror bombing, it's actually proper strategic bombing. It's a legit target whose damage causes logistical problems for their forces in combat. Positive results aren't based on intangibles like morale, nor on mistaken assumptions that morale can be broken. 

Historically, Russia likes terror tactics, they have had success using them. But not at doing it by strategic air power. At least not consistently, when it happens it seems to be either a deliberate political message or a mistake. 

The latter should never be ruled out.

All the cruise missiles for starters, that could have been used against more effective targets. All the wasted staff time planning out a failing strategic offensive. The cost in political capital caused by initiating a deliberate policy of strategic terror bombing. Etc.

And if you actually did want to break morale through terror bombing it'll take more than a few cruise missiles a month. 

A  psychiatrist who studied morale (MacCurdy, The Structure of Morale) had a chapter on the German Blitz on London. He broke everyone in England down into three categories: The dead, who died in the bombing campaign who didn't matter afterwards as dead people don't have morale. The survivors of near misses, who are the most susceptible to their morale suffering. And those who experience remote misses, whose morale actually improves because they experience the ineffectiveness of strategic bombing, which is that they weren't affected by it, plus desires for vengeance. 

That was one reason atomic bombings were so effective, everyone in a city hit is either dead or a near miss survivor. And the results are so devastating that even the remote miss in other areas outside ground zero realize they only survived because they weren't chosen as the target. The destructive power doesn't just break the will of the populace but the nation's leadership who realize they can't stop it and don't want to keep experiencing it.

But that's a 14 kiloton or larger nuke. Not a few cruise missiles with only a couple hundred pounds of high explosives. The Russians don't even possess the munitions or deliver systems to even try to carry out an effective terror campaign, let alone one that could actually succeed, which again, would be a fluke if it did.",6b612cbdfb1dfbb4df42712c6512dfc60d28fc88,True,False,,,,,0,1654533310,,0,{},ibdsxmr,False,t3_v61vur,False,True,t1_ibdn9ev,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v61vur/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_06_2022/ibdsxmr/,1654533330,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654504510.0

Kharkiv Front - local battles and artillery skirmishes. No significant changes.  
Approximately the same can be said about all other sections of the front, except for the Severodonetsk-Lysychansk area. In the Avdeevka area - fierce artillery fire and attempts of counterattacks by the Ukrainian forces (in small numbers). Near Ugledar, the RF and DNR forces ""depict activity"", but without visible results.  
All the main forces of the opponents in Donbass are now concentrated in the Severodonetsk-Lysychansk area. Where they are mutually ""grinded"". The command of Russian troops is logically trying to ""press"" the encirclement of the AFU grouping, which is in the bag in the area of these cities and protrusion in the agglomeration of Zolote (with adjacent villages and settlements). For its part, the AFU are stubbornly clinging to every meter of terrain and (probably for political and propaganda reasons) are just as stubbornly unwilling to finally leave Severodonetsk, where fierce street fighting continues. As a result of counterattacks from the ""industrial area"" (the Azot plant), the enemy managed to move the fighting back into the city. It is unclear how deep it is. Ukro sources claim to have ""liberated most of the city"" and provide their own maps to confirm this (the maps, however, are not confirmed by any photo or video material). Our military correspondents refute this and speak of ""insignificant advance of the enemy, already stopped"". And they are also completely unfounded. I still have no data from my own sources. So I state only that my forecast of four days ago that ""our troops will finish mopping up Severodonetsk in a day or two, unless the enemy throws some fresh units there for slaughter"" was not justified in the first part and was justified in the second. The Ukrainians deployed reserves (including the notorious ""foreign legion"") and the fighting continues. It will be possible to assess the advisability of such a decision by the enemy only at the end of the battle. If our troops manage to encircle the entire Severodonetsk-Lysychansk grouping, more units and formations will get into the cauldron and be defeated. But if not - then the enemy will have the opportunity to tie up our troops with fighting in the urban area for another few days to a few weeks (depending on how things go).

  
(I was recently ""booed"" here in the ""trolley"" that my prediction about ""the Popasna scenario for Severodonetsk-Lysychansk was not justified""... alas, it did... and how very much so...)  
The situation with ""closing the cauldron"" in the area west of Lisichansk is also unclear. Our people claim they are gradually advancing. The Ukrainians claim they ""firmly hold and counterattack"". We'll see. In any case, the stakes are quite high. It is unlikely that the AFU command already has the capacity to withdraw its grouping from the Severodonetsk-Lysychansk-Zolote area in an organized manner without defeating the retreating units and suffering very heavy losses in equipment and men.  


The fiercest battles with massive use of artillery, aviation and armored vehicles are now taking place there. And neither side can afford to end the battle ""in a draw"". The encirclement of the Ukrainians would be a severe defeat for them. Both militarily and politically. Failure to encircle would leave the Russian command unable to defeat even part of the enemy group in Donbass (after the failure to defeat the entire group already took place). This, too, will lead to severe military and political consequences.",3c2c5aede7cc9cdcef6b9b677aaa524548b15f65,True,False,,,,,0,1654530952,,0,{},ibdnfyc,False,t3_v61vur,False,True,t3_v61vur,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v61vur/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_06_2022/ibdnfyc/,1654530964,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654502152.0

------------

Recently the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Midway took place. And I remembered that I seen a recent (2020) study on it. 

This paper looks at the evidence of the battle and found that much of the previously conventional thought about the battle was incorrect. In the years since the events new evidence has come to light, and some of the evidence that was once considered accurate is now known to be false. 

I do take some issue with this study's methodology and therefore conclusion, you can read about in the last two paragraphs quoted. However it does seem conclusive to me that the old conventional wisdom was wrong in many ways, and it does merit new research.

Abstract

Lanchester-type combat models have been widely used to study the outcome of battles and to carry on counterfactual experiments to analyze the consequence of commanders' decisions, tactics, concentration/dispersion of forces, quality-versus quantity, and so on. This paper uses a stochastic salvo combat model to study the Battle of Midway. 

The model is calibrated according to the historical outcome. The model is then simulated and used to study four alternative counterfactual scenarios: 

(i) all of the launched American attack aircraft reach the Japanese carriers, 

(ii) the Japanese have one additional carrier, 

(iii) the Japanese do not wait to launch their attack aircraft, and 

(iv) the American carriers are spotted earlier. 

Contrary to the common wisdom that the result of the battle was an ""incredible"" American victory, Monte Carlo simulations show that the probability of the Japanese winning was very low and actually close to zero. Even in the most favorable scenario for the Japanese, the Battle of Midway remains an American victory.

———————————

&gt; * The Battle of Midway is widely considered to be the turning point in the Pacific theatre of World War II and the most important defeat of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN). Many authors refer to the outcome of this battle (the sinking of all four Japanese aircraft carriers by the US Navy) as an “incredible victory” or a “miracle”. Furthermore, Isom (2000, p.60) noted that “this was a battle the Americans should have lost.” 

&gt; * A number of reasons have been presented to explain the overwhelming American victory at Midway, such as the “victory disease” of the Japanese, poor decisions made by Nagumo. However, more recent studies (Isom, 2000, 2007; Parshall et al., 2001; and Marshall and Tully, 2005), based on in-depth analyses and new information from interviews with survivors and Japanese sources, argue that the American victory was not the product of tactical incompetence by the Japanese but the logical result of the course of actions. 

&gt; * The work by Parshall and Tully (2005) is a ground breaking analysis in understanding the real causes of the Japanese defeat at Midway. Their book questions several accounts of the events and explanations accepted by the traditional historical wisdom, arguing that they “are either untrue, or at least require careful clarification.”

&gt; * In this paper, we advance their ideas, showing that the Battle of Midway was indeed a battle the Japanese would never have won (simulation results suggest that the probability of the Japanese winning is very low and actually close to zero) and that the historical events were a function of timing produced by the early Japanese attack on the Midway Island air base. 

&gt; * We find that “luck” was indeed with the Japanese side, as likely the result could have been the sinking of all four aircraft carriers with no damage to any of the three American carriers.

&gt; * Considering all these counterfactual experiments together, the most likely outcome for the battle goes from the loss of all four Japanese carriers (or five in the case of an additional carrier being present) and no loss for the Americans, to the loss of three Japanese carriers and two American CVs. Overall the results presented in this paper can be interpreted as quantitative support of the analysis done by Parshall and Tully (2005) refuting explanations of the American victory at Midway. 

&gt; * All these elements create a picture that is far from the traditional view that the Japanese had little or no information.

—————————

From the Conclusion:

&gt; * The result of the Battle of Midway is heavily conditioned by the earlier attack on the Midway Air Base. This initial operation reduced the force to the equivalent of two Japanese aircraft carriers, a force clearly inferior to the three American aircraft carriers plus the Midway Air Base. Only in the unlikely case in which the IJN fleet were not discovered by USN reconnaissance and the American carriers being spotted earlier, that is, the Japanese attacking the American carriers first, would the Japanese have a chance to win the battle. As noted by Parshall and Tully (2005) based on information from the Senshi Sosho, the American victory at Midway was not unexpected to the Japanese since in the war-games conducted by the Japanese on May 25 (just nine days before the battle), America had inflicted heavy losses on the Japanese carriers.

&gt; * All results obtained from the counterfactual analyses are subject to the assumption that the observed historical outcome is the average, which could be a caveat if the observed results were unlikely to occur. Nevertheless, the result of the battle is consistent with the predictions by Hughes (2000), and hence, the observed result would not be much different from what we consider to the average outcome. Future research will consist of applying the methodology developed by MacKay et al. (2016) to confirm that the historical outcome of the Battle of Midway was close to the expected average result.",548fdec1eb1de17eeb751b4e1c0c8d00a7d95e6b,True,False,,,,,0,1654526757,,0,{},ibde1gz,True,t3_v654yz,False,True,t3_v654yz,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v654yz/revisiting_the_battle_of_midway_a_counterfactual/ibde1gz/,1654526767,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654497957.0

Col. Ali Esmaelzadeh was the second high-ranking officer of the same unit to die in a week. The circumstances were unclear, and Iranian news media provided conflicting reports.

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/04/world/middleeast/iran-israel-guards-death.html

The death of a senior Iranian military officer at his home in a Tehran suburb a week ago has fueled conflicting reports that he fell from a balcony, committed suicide or was killed.

The officer, Col. Ali Esmaelzadeh, died about a week after another high-ranking officer in the same unit, Col. Sayad Khodayee, was killed in a drive-by shooting in Tehran.

Their deaths come amid a new wave of heightened tensions between Iran and Israel, which for years have conducted a clandestine war of sabotage and targeted killings.

Both officers were high-ranking members of an elite secret detachment of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force, Unit 840, which Israeli officials say is tasked with killing foreigners abroad.

Iran blamed Israel for the killing of Colonel Khodayee, the deputy commander of the unit, and Israel told American officials that it was behind the killing, according to an intelligence official briefed on the communications.
But two senior Israeli defense officials said Friday that Israel did not kill Colonel Esmaelzadeh. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record.

The death of Colonel Esmaelzadeh was first reported Thursday by the Saudi-financed, London-based Persian television channel Iran International. The report, citing anonymous sources in Iran, said that Revolutionary Guards officials suspected Colonel Esmaelzadeh of spying for Israel and staged his suicide.

The New York Times could not verify that claim, and Iranian and Israeli officials declined to comment. One official Iranian news outlet said that report was false.

But Iranian news media have offered conflicting reports on Colonel Esmaelzadeh’s death.

Sabreen News, an outlet affiliated with the Quds Forces, reported Thursday that Colonel Esmaelzadeh died after falling off the balcony of his home in Karaj, Iran, under “suspicious circumstances.” The report said that investigations were underway.

Iran’s official news agency, IRNA, said that Colonel Esmaelzadeh had died after “an accident” at his apartment, and denied that he had been killed.

A news platform on the Telegram app affiliated with the Guards, Ammariyon, initially reported that the colonel had been assassinated, then deleted the report and said he had committed suicide by jumping off the balcony.
The Tasnim news agency, also affiliated with the Guards, reported Friday that Colonel Esmaelzadeh had fallen off the balcony because it did not have appropriate guard rails, and that the coroner’s office had confirmed the cause of death.

There were other unusual circumstances surrounding his death that raised red flags for some Iranians.

Colonel Esmaelzadeh was a high-ranking officer in an elite unit, but Iranian news media did not report the death for over a week, until the London-based Iran International did.

The Revolutionary Guards have not issued a statement or offered public condolences to the family, standard procedure for a fallen officer.

The funeral was held under a media blackout in a remote village in his native province of Hamedan, according to fliers for the event posted on social media — not, as would be customary, at Tehran’s main cemetery with news coverage and officials in attendance.

For three days after Colonel Esmaelzadeh’s death, security guards swarmed his neighborhood in Karaj, according to an Iranian reporter who was there and asked not to be identified.

The confusion has led some Iranians, including conservatives, to question the competing narratives.

“Who had the power to carry out the killing of Colonel Esmaelzadeh and why?” tweeted Attaollah Husseini, a conservative veteran of the armed forces.

“It is impossible for IRGC members, who are on the path of martyrdom all their lives, to commit suicide,” tweeted Abbas Qaidari, a researcher on Iran defense policy in Toronto. He added that if the Guards were suspicious of someone, they would arrest and interrogate him. “The clues are elsewhere,” he said.

The deaths of the two officers of Unit 840 were not the only murky deaths in Iran in the past two weeks. On May 25, a drone attack damaged a military site outside Tehran where Iran develops missile, nuclear and drone technology, and killed a Defense Ministry engineer.

There was no claim of responsibility for the attack, but it fit a pattern of previous Israeli strikes.

Iranian officials have pledged to take revenge on Israel for the killing of Colonel Khodayee last month, prompting Israel to warn its citizens from traveling to countries in the region where Iran may have operatives.

Prime Minister Naftali Bennett of Israel said in a speech on Sunday that Iran had carried out terrorism through proxies against Israel for years but that “the era of immunity for the Iranian regime is over.”

Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Ali Bagheri Kani, shot back on Friday, telling a reporter in Norway, “The Zionists may only be able to dream of striking Iran — and if that happens, it will be a dream from which they will never wake up.”

Abstract

Lanchester-type combat models have been widely used to study the outcome of battles and to carry on counterfactual experiments to analyze the consequence of commanders' decisions, tactics, concentration/dispersion of forces, quality-versus quantity, and so on. This paper uses a stochastic salvo combat model to study the Battle of Midway. 

The model is calibrated according to the historical outcome. The model is then simulated and used to study four alternative counterfactual scenarios: 

(i) all of the launched American attack aircraft reach the Japanese carriers, 

(ii) the Japanese have one additional carrier, 

(iii) the Japanese do not wait to launch their attack aircraft, and 

(iv) the American carriers are spotted earlier. 

Contrary to the common wisdom that the result of the battle was an ""incredible"" American victory, Monte Carlo simulations show that the probability of the Japanese winning was very low and actually close to zero. Even in the most favorable scenario for the Japanese, the Battle of Midway remains an American victory.

———————————

&gt; * The Battle of Midway is widely considered to be the turning point in the Pacific theatre of World War II and the most important defeat of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN). Many authors refer to the outcome of this battle (the sinking of all four Japanese aircraft carriers by the US Navy) as an “incredible victory” or a “miracle”. Furthermore, Isom (2000, p.60) noted that “this was a battle the Americans should have lost.” 

&gt; * A number of reasons have been presented to explain the overwhelming American victory at Midway, such as the “victory disease” of the Japanese, poor decisions made by Nagumo. However, more recent studies (Isom, 2000, 2007; Parshall et al., 2001; and Marshall and Tully, 2005), based on in-depth analyses and new information from interviews with survivors and Japanese sources, argue that the American victory was not the product of tactical incompetence by the Japanese but the logical result of the course of actions. 

&gt; * The work by Parshall and Tully (2005) is a ground breaking analysis in understanding the real causes of the Japanese defeat at Midway. Their book questions several accounts of the events and explanations accepted by the traditional historical wisdom, arguing that they “are either untrue, or at least require careful clarification.”

&gt; * In this paper, we advance their ideas, showing that the Battle of Midway was indeed a battle the Japanese would never have won (simulation results suggest that the probability of the Japanese winning is very low and actually close to zero) and that the historical events were a function of timing produced by the early Japanese attack on the Midway Island air base. 

&gt; * We find that “luck” was indeed with the Japanese side, as likely the result could have been the sinking of all four aircraft carriers with no damage to any of the three American carriers.

&gt; * Considering all these counterfactual experiments together, the most likely outcome for the battle goes from the loss of all four Japanese carriers (or five in the case of an additional carrier being present) and no loss for the Americans, to the loss of three Japanese carriers and two American CVs. Overall the results presented in this paper can be interpreted as quantitative support of the analysis done by Parshall and Tully (2005) refuting explanations of the American victory at Midway. 

&gt; * All these elements create a picture that is far from the traditional view that the Japanese had little or no information.

—————————

From the Conclusion:

&gt; * The result of the Battle of Midway is heavily conditioned by the earlier attack on the Midway Air Base. This initial operation reduced the force to the equivalent of two Japanese aircraft carriers, a force clearly inferior to the three American aircraft carriers plus the Midway Air Base. Only in the unlikely case in which the IJN fleet were not discovered by USN reconnaissance and the American carriers being spotted earlier, that is, the Japanese attacking the American carriers first, would the Japanese have a chance to win the battle. As noted by Parshall and Tully (2005) based on information from the Senshi Sosho, the American victory at Midway was not unexpected to the Japanese since in the war-games conducted by the Japanese on May 25 (just nine days before the battle), America had inflicted heavy losses on the Japanese carriers.

&gt; * All results obtained from the counterfactual analyses are subject to the assumption that the observed historical outcome is the average, which could be a caveat if the observed results were unlikely to occur. Nevertheless, the result of the battle is consistent with the predictions by Hughes (2000), and hence, the observed result would not be much different from what we consider to the average outcome. Future research will consist of applying the methodology developed by MacKay et al. (2016) to confirm that the historical outcome of the Battle of Midway was close to the expected average result.",36de359fb9a66a245ae300436f73cad29c8332e7,True,False,,,,,0,1654522376,,0,{},ibd52u7,True,t3_v63h7u,False,True,t3_v63h7u,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v63h7u/revisiting_the_battle_of_midway_a_counterfactual/ibd52u7/,1654522393,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654493576.0

In reality, Hunter Biden was never under investigation (or considered for investigation) and Joe Biden was stating the official US government (and EU) position that Shokin was corrupt and was himself *preventing* proper corruption investigations.

[],False,,Pantegral-7,,,[],,,,text,t2_aecel,False,False,"The core of this argument is that Russia is not a modern nation-state, but rather a vestigial colonial empire where the powerful core (centered around Moscow) still rules over a vast and impoverished periphery, in which subject non-Russian ethnicities' aspirations for self-determination are brutally suppressed. This is the fundamental cause of why all Russian regimes have returned to autocracy: democratisation demands extensive decentralisation, which means taking periphery interests (including potential secession) into account, instead of imposing the core's will on them - something which the Moscow political elite would never consent to.

Thus, any Moscow-centric opposition movement, no matter how liberal or pro-West, will eventually turn autocratic because it's the only way to maintain the core's iron grip over the colonial periphery. Kamil specifically cites Lukashenko as a cautionary tale of how a Navalny presidency could end up: he actually started his political career as a pro-democratic, anti-corruption crusader back in the early 90s, eventually succeeding in gaining the Belarusian presidency - after which he rapidly cemented absolute power and destroyed the opposition.

Hence Kamil's claim that ""no tsar can ever give you freedom"" - he fears that Navalny, if given the near-total power that Putin has, will also eventually turn to autocracy simply to keep Russia together. Considering that Navalny has a history of ultranationalist and revanchist statements that was only swept under the rug when his movement began to solicit Western support, this is a very real concern.

As a result, proponents of this argument instead wants to dismantle the Russian state altogether - a dozen or so countries of ""managable size"", which would be free to set their own paths. The risk that most of these states may also regress to autocracy, or that the rump Russian core may turn to vengeful revanchism to reverse its dismemberment, are both fully acknowledged; but a few decades of active engagement and integration with the Western world could prevent the former, and stop the latter from gaining traction. And even if democratic backsliding happens, a dozen small states are far more manageable threats than a single, continental-scale great power.

Why would they be beholden to the views of pro-democracy activists in some future hypothetical election? It's absolutely possible to be pro-democracy and pro-imperialism at the same time, and if that's viewed as a winning combination, I'm not sure why they wouldn't hold those positions.

Really, it would have to come down to why there were free elections in the first place. Is it because Navalny's movement gains enough traction to force that to happen? Then sure, anti-war is probably the move. But if it's in response to a power vacuum in the Kremlin because Putin is somehow gone, or because the regime is forced to hold elections to regain legitimacy, it's not entirely clear that a pro-war, anti-corruption candidate wouldn't do pretty well.

Kamil Galeev makes the [argument](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1521147854949036032.html) that a Russian liberal takeover or regime change won't stop Russian agression, as he argues that Russian liberals have a similar ideology to Putin. I'm not sure if I properly understand him, but he seems to be of the opinion that the west should support regional Russian movements that decentralise the Russian system and wrest power from Moscow to other parts of Russia and support regional separatist movements as that will mean Russia has less manpower and resources if it wants to persue further agressive policies against the west.

For the sake of length, I left out a lot of stuff in the linked thread, but I did copy and paste the most relevant parts here:

&gt;The potential regime change and a ""liberal"" takeover won't change anything. In fact, it might make the situation worse. Despite being actively whitewashed by the Western media Russian liberals fundamentally share the same ideology as Putin and are just as racist and imperialist  
&gt;  
&gt;Since the rule of metropoly over colonies is largely based on its supposed moral &amp; cultural superiority, Russian liberals will shift responsibility for Putinism and Z-war on minorities. Consider London-based journalist Kashin: supporting Putin is ""sucking an Armeno-Chechen dick""  
&gt;  
&gt;Kashin is not some sort of extremist. He is a part of the Russian liberal establishment and published his articles in Kommersant, Republic, Sputnik and Pogrom, New York Times and so on. As I told, Western media will go to the great length to whitewash Russian ""liberal opposition""  
&gt;  
&gt;Heavy participation of periphery in the Z-war will allow Russian liberals to shift all the blame on minorities:  
  
""Only three \[of participators in Bucha massacre\] are from Moscow, so they aren't Muscovites, but just common nonhumans (нелюди) from the toiletless-villages""  
&gt;  
&gt;Russian ethnic periphery is trapped between the Putin and the ""liberal opposition"", both of whom view periphery as nonhumans to be punished, disciplined and exploited. It has no interest in either side winning. It has an interest in dismantlement of the Russian imperial system  
&gt;  
&gt;Dismantlement of the Russian empire will secure a peace by undermining any further attempts of the imperial restoration. Unable to recruit the cannon fodder in periphery (as it is doing it now), Russia won't have manpower to act as the ""menace of the world"" as it is used to

That's not infrastructure damage works.  Russian blowing up a steel mill doesn't cause a few hundred million dollars worth of aid to Ukraine vanish.  The cost to rebuild Ukraine from the wretched things Russia has done to it will certainly be large, and the West will certainly foot a large portion of the bill, but how infrastructure damage is paid for doesn't decide how the war ends.

The country that loses isn't the one that takes the most damage.  The country that loses is the one that stops fighting first.  If Ukrainians wants to keep fighting for their democracy and to be free and independent of an imperial Russia, the West will certainly keep providing arms and money.  

Personally, I think as long as the Ukrainians are in supply, they will win.  Ukrainians are fighting and defending their homes and democracy, while Russians on the other hand are fighting and dying trying to kill their neighbors so that Putin, the autocratic dictator that owns Russia, can add to his legacy before he dies.  My money is on the Ukrainians being the ones being willing to fight longer.

&gt;Russia will contract by 10-15%, and Ukraine's GDP will contract by half at a minimum, Morgan Stanley sees Ukraine's GDP slump by 60% in 2022 if ""no clear resolution"". In a war of attrition, there will only be one winner. Ukraine is the one getting destroyed after all.

Russia's economy will continue to contract, they will be cut from supplies, and they will struggle to replace their losses because Russia's industry is so decerped and corrupt, and their high tech sector is completely non-existent. 

The thing that you appear to be struggle really hard to understand is that Ukrainian can lose half of it's GDP because the West is supply them with arms and money.  Let's put it this way; that 40 billion dollars the US dumped onto Ukraine was not the first money and arms dump, and it won't be the last.  That 40 billion dollars didn't even dent the US budget.  To put in perspective how big 40 billion dollars is, Russia's entire defense budget is 65 billion dollars.  

Think about that.  The US casually chucked enough aid to nearly match the entire Russian defense budget, and the US isn't the only nation providing aid, and this isn't the first or last aid package.  Ukraine currently has a larger military budget than Russia.  The only thing holding Ukraine back is that it takes a few months to properly train and equip the huge mass of conscripts.

[],False,,Metadrifter,,,[],,,,text,t2_40p7k1dm,False,False,"I find any kind of quantification questionable regarding weapons such as nukes. Suppose all the Russian nukes are perfectly maintained, it still won’t take much for a few to hit their industrial arteries and other major major organs. Vice versa as well.

The fact is, if a nuke suddenly goes up the US and NATO might possibly launch in retaliation because waiting around to see where it hits is just accepting, potentially.

Secondly though, if they do this it’s going to cause beyond horrific damage to international diplomacy. Smaller capable nations will start arming up with nukes immediately, meaning any kind of conventional threat will shoot up the ladder. And ultimately I can’t see NATO not responding in some kind of manner lest they want to topple in terms of use and credibility.

Also questionable if the nukes will launch should Putin order it. The US left Vietnam and Afghanistan without nuking them. The Soviets did the same. Losing Ukraine is a terrible blow but the logic here is one admin loses job/lives=fuck it, all of Russia can die with whoever we can take with us.

Putin might want to do it, but the cost of such of action is astronomical. It has a high likelihood to break any kind of relations between them and the rest of the developed worlds—including China.

[],False,,GenesisX10,,,[],,,,text,t2_25r0pr3y,False,False,"&gt;You realize grain can be shipped over land, right? Ukraine is not going to have an issue selling its goods.

Almost all of the 60 million tons of grain that Ukraine exports every year is shipped out via ports like Odesa. And commercial activity at those ports was basically shut down as soon as Russia invaded.

There are 760,000 metric tons of grain that is traveling by land, getting transported by railway and trucks to other European countries. These land options, though, have challenges. Let's take trains first. The problem here is something called rail gauge or track gauge. This is the width between the two rails of the track. And it turns out the Ukrainian track gauge is wider than what's used in its European neighbors. So a train carrying Ukrainian wheat can't just travel into, say, Hungary on the same track. It has to stop at the border at a special terminal, and the cargo has to be reloaded onto a different grain car that fits the European standard. Another major piece of the strategy is using trucks. The issue here is that drivers need special licenses to haul cargo internationally, and customs procedures and sanitary checks on the borders are causing delays.

Getting Ukrainian grain to a port on the Baltic, such as Gdańsk and Gdynia, is slow and expensive. The EU is focusing on developing alternative overland routes. But opening Ukrainian ports is the only realistic option to maintain the volume of grain, as ground transportation infrastructure (rail and truck) cannot accommodate the volume.

I feel like there's 2 big ways you could do this:

1. Make a lot of fake tanks and trucks, and hope that the enemy thinks they're real. [Sort of like these things.](https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/the-funny-tanks-of-d-day)
2. Do a lot of troop movements at night, while trying to setup shop in concealment during the day as much as possible.

I do not think that Russia trying to do it's best North Korea impression is going to work out any butter for the Russians than it has worked out for the North Koreans, who are the poorest people on the planet.  No, this an absolute disaster for the Russian economy.  

The Russian people have my pity.  I hope one day the Russian people manage to throw off their dictators and engage in democratic self governance so that they can stop being so thoroughly used and abused by one dictator after another, but I'm not holding my breath.  Russian dictators have gotten good at beating the people into line.  Sadly, they are the ones that will suffer while their overlords remain fat and comfortable even in the face of economic ruination.
