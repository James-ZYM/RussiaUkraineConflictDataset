Force (or a good figurative dick-punch) is what Russians understand, not alliances, peace treaties or Western notions of ""fair play"".

Remember that Stalin got to keep East Karelia and Petsamo as part of Russia after the Red Army launched into a war of conquest with Finland as the Winter War (1939-40). Then there's also the shameless incorporation of the three Baltic republics and Bessarabia (from Romania) into the USSR after having annexed all of them in 1940 like Putin did with Crimea in 2014. These lands became the Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian and Moldavian SSRs respectively. After WW II Stalin got to extend the borders of the USSR further by appending eastern Poland and far eastern Czechoslovakia to its vassals / sham republics in the form of the Belorussian and Ukrainian SSRs respectively, and even keep Sakhalin Island (earlier it was Chinese territory through the Manchu Dynasty) and the Kuril Islands after yoinking them from Japan. It's just never enough. The Russians lust for ever more foreign territory as much as a hoarder lusts for ever more junk from a yard sale.

KYIV, Ukraine ‚Äî As the Russian army made its move on Kyiv in late February, the Ukrainian defences enlisted a drone pilot to pinpoint a column of military vehicles approaching the capital from the west.

Ôøº

The civilian who took on the task sent his drone up in a field near his house and found the Russian convoy. Ukrainian artillery destroyed it and the drone operator was quietly saluted as a hero.

He‚Äôs also 15.

In an interview with Global News, Andrii Pokrasa acknowledged he was the kid who helped stop the Russian invasion of Kyiv.

The incident was confirmed by his parents, the head of the Ukrainian drone owners federation and a commander in the armed forces unmanned reconnaissance section.

‚ÄúHe was the only one who was experienced with drones in that region,‚Äù explained the commander, Yurii Kasjanov. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a real hero, a hero of Ukraine.‚Äù

Pokrasa said the experience was ‚Äúvery, very scary‚Äù but he didn‚Äôt want the Russian soldiers to overrun his town.

He said the civil defence forces turned to him because they needed the GPS coordinates of the Russian column so it could be targeted.

‚ÄúThey provided us information where approximately the Russian column could be. Our goal was to find the exact coordinates and provide the coordinates to the soldiers,‚Äù Pokrasa said.

‚ÄúIt was one of the biggest columns that was moving on the Zhytomyr road and we managed to find it because one of the trucks turned on its lights for a long time.‚Äù

His father passed the details over to a territorial defence unit using a social media app and the Russian invasion force was stopped near Berezivka, about 40 kilometres west of Kyiv.

‚ÄúI gave them the coordinates and photos, and after that they targeted the location,‚Äù the teenager said. ‚ÄúAnd I needed to coordinate more specifically where they should shell with artillery.‚Äù

Global News is not publishing the name of Pokrasa‚Äôs town for security reasons.

Consumer drones have become a crucial tool in the Ukraine war. Hundreds of civilian drone operators have been documenting everything from Russian troop movements to evidence of war crimes.

Their images are posted online or shared with Ukrainian authorities, leaving the Russian invasion force nowhere to hide, all because of commercial technology that even kids can operate.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a game-changer for the war,‚Äù said Taras Troiak, a former drone retailer who heads the Federation of Drone Owners of Ukraine.

Ôøº

Following the Feb. 24 invasion ordered by President Vladimir Putin, Troiak started a Facebook group to encourage civilian drone operators to locate Russian forces near Kyiv and inform the military.

About 1,000 civilian operators have since joined the effort, and drones have been arriving from supporters in Europe and North America, he said.

‚ÄúIf we didn‚Äôt have such operators and drones who can help the Ukrainian army, I think Kyiv already could be occupied by Russian forces,‚Äù said Troiak.

Youths were also involved, he added, recounting how Pokrasa detected a Russian column that had crossed the border from Belarus and was on the highway between Zhytomyr and Kyiv.

‚ÄúThis kid sent GPS coordinates and Russians, after this, became dead,‚Äù he said during an interview at his office in Kyiv.

Despite his role repelling the invasion, Pokrasa seemed like an otherwise typical teen. There was a skateboard and trampoline in his yard, and a bike on the front porch.

Afraid of heights, he saw a YouTube video of drone footage filmed over Kyiv and became hooked on looking at the world from above, he said.

Using money he and his father made buying and selling crypto-currency, he bought his first mini-drone last summer and began flying it every day, although once school began he wasn‚Äôt able to spend as much time with it.

When the Russians came, he initially stayed home with his family. But a few days into the war he was asked to help because he was the only person in the region with a working drone.

Because his neighbors frowned on his drone, fearing it would make them targets, he took it to a nearby field with his father after dark. He eventually spotted the moving headlights that gave away the Russian convoy.

‚ÄúIt was two kilometres from us,‚Äù he said.

He had mixed feelings about the Russian soldiers who were killed as a result.

‚ÄúFirst of all I was so happy, but also it was¬†people there. They were occupiers but anyway they were people,‚Äù he said.

Using a bigger drone with a longer range supplied by the Ukrainian forces, Pokrasa continued to help spot Russian military movements.

‚ÄúI tried to protect them as much as possible,‚Äù Kasjanov said of Pokrasa and his father. ‚ÄúI asked Andrii ‚ÄòAre you not afraid?‚Äô And he replied ‚ÄòYes I am scared but I can‚Äôt do it any other way.'‚Äù

The commander said many youths too young to join the armed forces had been contributing, not only with drones but also by relaying information collected by watching Russian troops from their homes and vehicles.

‚ÄúThey feel themselves free people in a free land so that‚Äôs why they wanted to be part of it.‚Äù he said.

Pokrasa‚Äôs mother Iryna said she was worried when her husband began taking their son out at night to look for Russian soldiers ‚Äúbut they also didn‚Äôt tell me a lot of things.‚Äù

She eventually took him to Poland to finish the grade nine school year, although she said he wanted to stay in Ukraine and keep helping.

She said she was proud of her son, whom she felt was destined for a career as an entrepreneur but needed to spend more time on his studies.

Pokrasa said some of his friends were impressed and others weren‚Äôt when they heard about how he had taken on one of the world‚Äôs strongest armies with his drone.

Before the Holocaust the Nazis mass murdered the mentally ill and disabled first kind of as an early precursor on how they'd mass murder people later on. I think it was called 'Aktion T4' and the disabled and mentally ill were sent to asylums while the families were lied to saying they'd be well looked after, all was fine etc. But they'd actually of course kill them through intentional neglect, poisonings and I believe they first used a primitive gas chamber method on them with the Zyklon B. They lied to the families initially saying that their relative had died from TB, Pneumonia or sudden death but then eventually they just stopped bothering. 

I think Russia may be not just desperate for bodies in this dumb shit war but knowingly cruel enough to send the disabled up to the battle because they consider them 'worthless' just like the Nazis did'. I mean, they've been doing pretty similar shit like them before this, I wouldn't be surprised.

&gt;The Neptunes are anti-ship missiles so they can't be use here.

There's no reason they *can't* be used to strike land targets. Russia famously uses their anti-ship missiles as general purpose tactical missiles all the time.

The main reason you wouldn't want to do that is because anti-ship missiles have a lot of (very expensive and complicated) extra features to make them effective in their anti-ship role which are completely wasted in a land attack role; it's just a bit of a waste. In the context of a well-equipped NATO force, there's always going to be a more appropriate tool available, and in the context of Ukraine's current situation, they've only got a small number of Neptunes to use.

But if a target were important enough there's no reason why they *can't* be used.

Looks like you just reinvented conservatism, you're trying to define conservatism as a mathematical problem in order to troll or to hide your xenophobic bigotry?

&gt; What are the topics at hand, whether gay issues or theism or atheism or feminism - that is not important at all. There could be conservative gays, conservative atheists, conservative feminists, etc. What matters is how they approach to the decision-making on balancing the true and false positives and negatives. 

Hahaha, tell that to Mike Pence, I'm sure he totally agrees with you, oh wait, he's not really conservative. I suppose you're the only ""real"" conservative here. 

&gt; Not any stagnation is conservatism (for example, preserving dictatorship is not conservatism).

Stagnation of what? Your sentence doesn't make any sense. And conservatism is the preservation of the status quo, hence the origin of the word to conserve.
If you would read a history book on the 19th century, conservatism is literally the attempt to save and preserve  monarchical systems i.e. absolute monarchies (dictatorships) included.

Also the economy will play a role in this. I am well aware that Russia used to wage war with a basically non existent economy before in history. It's not new to them. But these sanctions are. They are only a couple months old and only now start showing effect. There will be more, indirect secondary effects coming which are hard to predict. In short: Russia's economy is currently in the need to be restructured and adjusted to being North Korea with an alcohol problem. Now pulling out almost all of the young men out of the workforce would only exacerbate the effects of the sanctions.

But the biggest difference is: Ukraine can actually spend that money. Russia is under sanctions. They may have a lot of Euros now, but nothing to use them on. It‚Äôs basically useless. Just numbers on a bank account. Did you know some Russian soldiers are paid in US Dollars? There was an audio of a guy telling his wife that, then laughing maniacally. They can‚Äôt feed the kids with money they‚Äôre not able to spend.

And finally, theres quite a lot of context. I hope you are interested in nuance, otherwise Im wasting a lot of time. The thing is, Germany,as most countries cannot just stop using gas.  It doesn‚Äôt help our previous government was really horny for gas, subsidizing gas heating and even labeling gas power plants as officially ‚Äûsustainable‚Äú. Just stupid. Everything is natural gas powered. If we stopped now, Gas reserves would run dry. People would freeze next winter, the economy would crash. The population would in no time force the government to give in to any demands. You can be sure Putin is aware of that. It‚Äôs a very powerful weapon, and in contrast to nuclear weapons, with light repercussions.

The government has seized all Russian run depots and decreed for every single depot to be filled until winter. So if Putin tries to weaponize it, we are not vulnerable.

But to fill them, gas is needed, and lots of it. But Germany is not the only one. So most of the gas is already under contract, and thanks to the russophiles in the previous governments Germany doesn‚Äôt even have a single LNG terminal. So it‚Äôs either Russia or Iran, mostly. Neither are great choices, but Germany needs both to buy time to find a better solution.

And there are some:

Gas is already being diluted with Hydrogen produced from excess Wind energy, but both more renewables aswell as more electrolysis capacity needs to be built. It can only be diluted a little bit for now, too, because the infrastructure is not made for Hydrogen.

Heating needs to be quickly changed to heat pumps running on renewables, ideally on the rooftops of the same houses. You can have a professional come by for free to make an assessment what would make sense on your home and an estimate what it should cost, so you can get a contractor for a fair price.For the ones who cannot afford this, there‚Äôs subsidies and extremely good loans.

&gt; Ukraine needs 60 multiple rocket launchers - many more than the handful promised so far by the UK and US - to have a chance of defeating Russia, according to an aide to the country&amp;#039;s presidency.

&gt; Arestovych said Ukraine needed many times more multiple launch rocket systems, which have a range far greater than anything in the country&amp;#039;s existing arsenal.

&gt; The US army has 363 Himars and 225 M270 rocket launchers, and the US Marines have a further 47, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, while the UK has 35 of its version of the M270s - indicating there could be capacity to supply more to Ukraine.

But additionally, the 2A4 was the best tank in the world for a very long time, and still stands reasonably favourably against all but upgraded versions of western tanks including the Leo 2 itself. It has better armour than the T-90M, and has better speed. There's probably not much difference in the guns, but the Leo fires faster since it does not use an autoloader. The Leo likely has better suspension and transmission too. Fire control/optics is supposedly inferior but I wouldn't trust Russian tech here either. But most importantly, Ukraine has better tank crews and better tank doctrines, more than making up any differences.

All of which ignores the fact that these Leos will almost certainly never actually get into a duel with a T-90M. Tank Vs tank combat is already extraordinarily rare, and even when it happens usually one tank has the drop on the other and fires first to win. The Leos will also surely be escorted by some of Ukraine's better troops, equipped with javelins and the like, if Ukrainians have even an ounce of sense (which they do).

Ideally, it would be no holds barred support turning Ukraine into a porcupine. However, doing so requires support.

1. Even if analysts always correctly predict what would happen if something does/doesn't happen, gathering the political support to do something about it is different. The west did not have casus belli to do so.

2. The ""overwhelming force or capitulation"" cannot work as Mearsheimer suggests it. No country can suddenly arm itself to rebuke all attacks (for both financial and political reasons), and if someone wanted to attack them, they won't wait for the country to arm itself. For smaller nations, the only option is to make the financial and political cost of winning so unpalatable that attacking is not considered beneficial. A pyrrhic victory, so to speak.

3. As impersonal as it sounds, lives are resources. While it is morally good to preserve life as much as possible, saying it is imperative to do so at all costs is moralization. Furthermore, this conflict has shown that more important than the preservation of life is the preservation of the ability to decide their way of life (not quite in the sense if morally good or not, but in the sense that people are willing to die for it, making it a greater consideration than lives).",2f8b1a52608d572c40d1b16aaef2363b0a0e4eec,True,False,,,,,0,1654548250,,0,{},iberlrr,False,t3_v5fvu3,False,True,t1_ibenje5,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v5fvu3/why_ukraine_war_is_not_the_wests_fault_realism/iberlrr/,1654548266,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654519450.0,

Corruption was already endemic in the old Soviet Union by the time it died. It was largely done behind the scenes, but whether it was Soviet generals using conscripts to build them a dacha or transport tax-free low-cost auto fuel to Moscow on board Soviet military aircraft, a lot of the Soviet military and other high-ranking Soviet officials were corrupt. So when the old SSRs became independent, the old nomenklatura started to effectively loot the place. And in the early days, the Ukrainian nomenklatura was fine with collaborating with the Russian nomenklatura and others to jointly loot Ukraine, Russia, Transnistria, Moldova etc - whatever they could steal, they did.

But as Samuel Johnson said, the prospect of death concentrates the mind.

Yes, not formally entering Ukraine into NATO was a poor move.

As for the overthrow, that part is highly contested by both sides. Yes, the west supported the opposition.

Russian troops are trying to reach Slavyansk and Kramatorsk. To do this, they fire at several cities in the Donetsk region: Bakhmut, Soledar, Avdeevka, Ocheretino, Svyatogorsk and a number of communities . This was announced by the head of the military administration of the Donetsk region Pavel Kirilenko on the air of the all-Ukrainian telethon.  

He noted that civilians still remained on the territory of the Svyatogorsk Lavra, who were hiding from shelling. In particular, these are migrants who lost their homes back in 2014.  

At the same time, the DPR group announced that Russian military and illegal armed groups had already captured the Svyatogorsk Lavra and the city. The General Staff of Ukraine has not yet reported on the real situation.

Aleksey Arestovich, adviser to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, speaking of Svyatogorsk, noted that it is not yet clear how far the Russian troops were able to advance

. At the same time, he predicts that Russian forces will be able to capture the city.

Earlier, the Russian invaders fired at the Svyatogorsk Lavra.

Like when a russian lady was workong for me (as an electrical engineer) a few months back. She is from crimea so she was/is exposed to the worst kind of propaganda. And it was obvious.
We talked about languages and how my native croatian is similar to russian and that both croatian and serbian can be written in cyrilic as well. I explained about the language reform that croatian and serbian went through in the 1800-s and how the old, non-standard language was messy but that some old dialects were more similar to russian than today. To that she replied, with all seriousness, that all languages are just renegade versions of russian and that similarly, ukrainians also made up a different language but that they actually should just speak russian.
I dropped my jaw. I could not believe that someone with a brain would believe that.
I let her go a few weeks later, mostly bc she was incompetent but that remark made me fire her even faster (without second chance). I did not want to listen to more russian bs.

They are told that it's us who is the agressor, and many useful idiots here believe it too.

https://international-review.org/dwarfing-the-giant-the-reality-of-russias-military-part-ii/  
  
What did Dobrev do that other analysts did not and what did he see ‚Äì some major points:  
  
‚Ä¢	Looked at local Russian news sources, social media, etc in various military districts and for military units.  
‚Ä¢	These showed that hazing was still rife, that many units were being run by corrupt officers and inability to meet authorized troop levels  
‚Ä¢	A specific example ‚Äì in some Russian districts, there were ‚Äúhelp wanted‚Äù ads in local newspapers for positions like snipers or BMP drivers. Literally as if the US Army was advertising in local US newspapers for specific positions  
‚Ä¢	News would leak out that was materially inconsistent with what Russian state media was trumpeting, indicating pay levels not competitive with even low-level civilian jobs, with troop numbers and equipment lists way below nominal  
‚Ä¢	Corruption affected even the most elite units, with top commanders being prosecuted for embezzlement/self-enrichment  
  
At the end, the host asks a good question ‚Äì given the ugly picture Stanimir paints of rottenness afflicting the Russian forces, why do Russian forces nonetheless now occupy about 20% of Ukraine?  
  
‚Ä¢	Weight of numbers is one thing ‚Äì there were still a lot of Russians who attacked, especially large numbers of Donetsk/Luhansk puppet state soldiers. Dobrev doesn‚Äôt say this, but I was reminded of a quote attributed to Stalin that quantity has a quality of its own.  
‚Ä¢	The Russian military district responsible for invasion from the south (i.e. out of Crimea) is the one that‚Äôs played the largest role in Ossetia, in Abkhazia and in Syria. It‚Äôs therefore the one with the most operational readiness and the one least affected by the issues discussed above.  
‚Ä¢	Conventional analysis was that Ukraine was toast, and this had an impact ‚Äì it delayed Ukrainian mobilization, it delayed deliveries of weapons from the west. And while Zelensky has done well, he and his cabinet had to learn on the job, and Ukraine‚Äôs govt was quite scared in the opening days and most focused on defending Kyiv.

Liberalism does not try to adhere to the Precautionary Principle, liberalism tries to aggressively optimize on the [ROC curve or similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic).  
  
What are the topics at hand, whether gay issues or theism or atheism or feminism - that is not important at all. There could be conservative gays, conservative atheists, conservative feminists, etc. What matters is how they approach to the decision-making on balancing the true and false positives and negatives.  
  
Not any stagnation is conservatism (for example, preserving dictatorship is not conservatism). And not any change is liberalism. There has to be additional criteria at play. That additional criterion is 'balance' (=game-theoretical equilibrium) that is best known as 'local social contract' and 'natural balance'. The 'local' part there is crucial, in that larger (regional, subcontinental,continental and global) social contracts can only stand on stable local social contracts. Which in turn places requirements on the set of constituents of the (social) contract - the contract could only be as stable as its constituents. Thus mass migrations destroy local social contracts because it changes the constituents too rapidly. Liberalism usually tries to neglect the 'local' part by keeping borders 'open' and thus fostering mass migrations. To liberals the people are a resource to make fortune, they don't so much care for the stability of the local social contract, they are fine with profiting from Tragedies of the Commons. Mass migrations is the mother of Tragedies of the Commons. Social contracts are needed to avoid or to overcome or alleviate Tragedies of the Commons.

&gt; LONDON, June 6 - Russia should not close the U.S. embassy despite the crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine because the world&amp;#039;s two biggest nuclear powers must continue to talk, the U.S. ambassador to Moscow was quoted as saying on Monday.

&gt; Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comIn a clear attempt to send a message to the Kremlin, John J. Sullivan, the U.S. ambassador appointed by President Donald Trump, told Russia&amp;#039;s state TASS news agency that Washington and Moscow should not simply break off diplomatic relations.

&gt; Relations were not re-established until 1933.&amp;quot;The only reason I can think of that the United State might be forced to close its embassy would be if it became unsafe to continue its work,&amp;quot; Sullivan said.

The US once again sees itself as engaged in a global struggle with Russia and China 

Gideon Rachman 		 		


Since Russia invaded Ukraine, there has been much talk of the echoes of the second world war and the dangers of a third one. But the current global moment is much more like a return of the cold war. Once again, the US is assembling a coalition of democracies to face off against a Russia-China axis. Once again, the dangers of a nuclear war are central to international politics. And once again, there is a large bloc of non-aligned countries ‚Äî now generally referred to as the ‚Äúglobal south‚Äù ‚Äî that is intensively courted by both sides. Many in the global south insist that Ukraine is a regional conflict that must not be allowed to disrupt or change the whole world. But policymakers in the Biden administration already frame the war in global terms. They see Russia and China as partners in a challenge to the ‚Äúrules-based order‚Äù, upheld by the US and its allies. The battles in Ukraine are currently the central theatre of that wider struggle. Viewed from Washington, security threats in Europe and Asia are now so deeply connected that the two continents are seen by officials as a ‚Äúsingle operating system‚Äù. That is a pattern of thinking that is very reminiscent of the cold war, when America was always mindful that what happened in Vietnam or Korea could have effects in the divided city of Berlin or in the north Atlantic. One big difference from the last cold war is that this time the Americans see China, not Russia, as their most serious rival. That belief has not been changed by the fact that it is Russian president Vladimir Putin who has launched a war. In fact, the China focus of the Biden administration intensifies the tendency to see the Ukraine war as not just about the security of Europe, but about the wider global order. While there is some glib talk in the west about attempting to ‚Äúdo a Kissinger‚Äù ‚Äî and once again engineer a split between Russia and China, as happened in the 1970s ‚Äî few in Washington believe that is a plausible near-term prospect. On the contrary, US officials see China as very firmly in Russia‚Äôs corner. Dissuading Beijing from translating its pro-Russian sentiments into direct military or economic support for Moscow remains a top American priority. US allies in Asia ‚Äî in particular Japan, South Korea and Australia ‚Äî are also very alive to the implications of the Ukraine war for their own security. The worst-case scenarios for them would be that Russia‚Äôs aggression emboldens China and distracts America ‚Äî leading to a region-transforming Chinese invasion of Taiwan. The best case is that the Ukraine war revitalises the western alliance and US global leadership and causes China to back off in Asia. In reality, however, Biden‚Äôs people do not think that Russia‚Äôs troubles in Ukraine have changed Chinese minds about the wisdom of a possible invasion of Taiwan. The Chinese, they believe, are more interested in figuring out where Russia has gone wrong ‚Äî and adjusting their own plans accordingly. The need for overwhelming force in any military action is one likely lesson. Another is the need to protect China‚Äôs economy from possible western sanctions. In late May, Biden visited Japan and South Korea ‚Äî and not for the first time suggested that the US would fight to defend Taiwan. (His administration was again forced to qualify the president‚Äôs comments.) At the end of June, Nato will hold a summit in Madrid. Significantly, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand have all been invited to attend.

Pulling together a coalition of democracies is meant to improve the west‚Äôs security position in both Europe and Asia. Countries such as Japan play an important symbolic and practical role in the struggle with Russia. They are vital to the sanctions effort ‚Äî making it much harder for Moscow to find easy ways around sanctions. In return, the Asians are keen to see European countries play a bigger security role in Asia. Recent naval visits to the region, by the British, French, Germans and Dutch, have been welcomed. But while the Americans are happy with the response of their most important north Asian allies to the Ukraine war, they are concerned by their failure to win the battle for opinion in south-east Asia. At a recent summit meeting with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Washington, some Asean leaders privately echoed Russian talking points about Nato‚Äôs responsibility for the war in Ukraine and alleged ‚Äúfalse flag‚Äù operations. India is seen as an even more important challenge. The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been careful to avoid taking sides on Ukraine, abstaining on the key UN votes and increasing oil imports from Russia. The Americans think that hectoring New Delhi on this subject is likely to be counter-productive. Instead, they are intent on gradually drawing India closer to them by emphasising the two countries‚Äô shared security interests in containing Chinese power. Some historians now see the first and second world wars as two stages of the same conflict ‚Äî separated by a generation of increasingly fragile peace. It may be that future historians will talk about the first and second cold wars ‚Äî separated by a 30-year era of globalisation. The first cold war ended with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. The second, it seems, began with the Russian invasion of Ukraine in

Due to the shortage of weapons, Ukrainians are forced to use budgetary methods of war.   
I read on twitter of NATO generals that this was planned from the beginning.   
Also, it seems that it was originally planned to strangle Ukraine with insufficient supplies of weapons, judging by the fact that they were not allowed to provide aviation to Ukraine, also, they were very reluctantly and belatedly HIMARS is to be provided,  etc.

Obviously, from the very beginning, a bet was made on an exhausting war. This is potentially a strategic miscalculation, because there are few Ukrainians, and even fewer ready to fight. Who will fight the Horde when it grinds 10% of the warring Ukrainians?

Second of all, it's not a trap. They are trying to hold on to the city because once they lose it it will be incredibly difficult if not impossible to take back. This isn't 5D chess.

Lastly, once the Ukrainian infantry are disengaged and artillery, as you say, just opens up en masse on the Russians, it is also then vulnerable to airstrikes and Russian artillery, which exist in much greater quantities, which will force it to retreat. 

Also, just as a side-note, when the battle is literally at point blank range, around 5-10 kilometers at maximum, what purpose does ""high ground"" for artillery serve in attacking the opponent in the city? For fixed emplacements and direct fire, yes, but you don't need a massive height advantage for weapon systems which can fire at least 30km away.

Having artillery on the ""high ground"" would be good not for attacking the city, but for counter battery fire, which means you would have to actually HOLD THE CITY, right?!",0298c118a38bb19497d5a3d4f668c77d11b4212c,True,False,,,,,0,1654541083,,0,{},ibeb3zr,False,t3_v697v7,False,True,t1_ibe70h9,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v697v7/severodonetsk_the_russians_received/ibeb3zr/,1654541097,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654512283.0,

I mean...if the ""europeans"" would apply the same standarts to all nations...we wouldnt be allied to the USA in the first place. The US drone warfare policy of ""100 killed civilians is acceptable to kill 1 terrorist"" is already a policy typical to Russia as well. Eather we measure everybody equal or you have to turn a blind eye to a lot of what is going on in the world.

&gt;Also, it is glaringly obvious now that Russia not only has corrupted very important individual politicians but has also corrupted the political dialogue in Europe, especially in Germany and France.

Sorry, but that isnt true. By that logic it has also corrupted political dialoge in the USA. The republicans are equally as pro russia the last decades as any european political party.

&gt;Nordstream and the Europeans went ahead with Nordstream 2!

The prime reasons for this was energy security. The USA wasnt exactly seen as a reliable partner (after blowing up europes primary oil suppliers in the middle east and forcing them to rely more on Russia) and Trump just send this into overdrive with his trade war against germany and NATO pullout threats.

The Nordstream pipelines were primarily build to circumvent the eastern european countries, not necessary for economic reasons but for simple political ones. The two biggest pipelines from russia went through Belarus-Poland and Ukraine to western europe. 2 of these countries were very instable and there were several instances were the oil and gas pipelines were nearly turned of leaving europe out of energy from oine day to another (ukriane not paying its debt to russia for gas for example). So western europe wanted to secure its supply lines directly to russia, who they knew for the last 50 years as a reliable partner that never broke any supply contract.

The big miscalculation was that nobody expectede Russia to go that far. Proxy war in eastern ukriane? Not nice but not exactly a big problem to most. Full invasion and annexation of Ukraine?

We‚Äôll send you a myFT Daily Digest email rounding up the latest War in Ukraine news every morning.

Russian advances have made it ‚Äúvery, very difficult‚Äù for Ukraine to win its war with Moscow, according to one of Kyiv‚Äôs top security officials who said the country was prepared for prolonged resistance.

Oleksiy Danilov, chief of the national security council, told the Financial Times that Ukraine could win ‚Äúbecause we are fighting for our freedom‚Äù. But he said a drawn-out war to drive out Russia‚Äôs invading army could only succeed if western countries accelerated supplies of advanced weapons.

Confidence that Ukraine could inflict further defeats on Russia after President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs forces retreated from most of the north and east of the country has given way to a dour mood in Kyiv as momentum has slowly swung back Russia‚Äôs way.

An offensive in the Donbas, where the worst fighting is concentrated, has put Russia on the verge of capturing Luhansk province, which together with Donetsk province makes up the industrial border region in Ukraine‚Äôs east.

Russian troops had taken most of Sievierodonetsk, an important regional centre, where heavy artillery barrages and street battles destroyed much of the city.

Ukraine said on Sunday it had mounted a counterattack and now held half of the city, where officials claimed they continued to push back Russia‚Äôs forces. Reports on Monday were mixed, with some officials suggesting Ukraine had lost ground again.

Ukraine also faces deep economic challenges after Russian missile strikes destroyed the country‚Äôs main oil refinery and depots, causing nationwide fuel shortages.

Electricity supplies are threatened after Russia occupied regions with most of the country‚Äôs coal mines and seized control of one of Ukraine‚Äôs four nuclear power stations.

‚ÄúMany factories and enterprises have stopped their production processes and cycles due to the fact that the Russian Federation today occupies about 20 per cent of our territory,‚Äù Danilov said, saying Ukraine‚Äôs only option was to outlast Russia.

‚ÄúHow long can Ukraine stay in this state? I can say long, very long. Although it will be very, very difficult for us,‚Äù he said.

Danilov said that in Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk ‚Äúthere is an advantage of the enemy in artillery‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚ÄâThey pound there, pound and pound.

‚ÄúUnfortunately, we cannot now adequately respond in the same way, given that the weapons that we sorely need are lacking today.‚Äù

He said Ukrainian forces could make a further retreat from Sievierodonetsk and other towns in the region while they regroup.

‚ÄúThe temporary loss of territories is not a tragedy. The tragedy will be the loss of the country,‚Äù Danilov said in an interview.

Danilov said he was confident the western weapons needed to launch a counter attack ‚Äúwill definitely arrive‚Äù, adding he was ‚Äúmore than confident that we will regain our territories‚Äù.

The US said last week it would supply Ukraine with new weapons, including multiple launch rocket systems, as part of a $40bn assistance package. The UK said on Monday it would also give Ukraine M270 MLRS, which have a range of up to 80km, well beyond the 25km range of most Russian heavy artillery. Spain is also reportedly set to deliver anti-aircraft missiles and Leopard A4 tanks from its munition reserves.

But the speed and scale of weapons deliveries has frustrated some in Kyiv, where President Volodymyr Zelensky has said Ukraine‚Äôs troops are outgunned 20 to one by Russian artillery and are dying at a rate of up to 100 a day, with 400 wounded.

Ukraine needs to form six new brigades of 25,000 men for a counter-offensive to reclaim territory held by Russia in the east and south, including hundreds of rocket launchers and artillery, planes and tanks as well as thousands of drones, another adviser to Ukraine‚Äôs government on security matters said.

The MLRS systems from the US also come with limited ammunition and can only fire at an 80km range rather than the 300km range Ukraine wants to hit Russia‚Äôs supply lines.

Danilov said western supplies had already played a crucial role in holding back Russia‚Äôs initial blitzkrieg.

He expressed confidence that the inflow of longer range and heavier calibre weaponry ‚Äúwill continue‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâuntil we defeat Russia‚Äù and said Ukraine‚Äôs continued defiance had ‚Äúbroken‚Äù concerns in western capitals about providing more powerful arms.

Russia‚Äôs apparent willingness to sacrifice its own troops for minor territorial gains, however, has made it more difficult for Ukraine‚Äôs forces to hold out, he added.

‚ÄúRussia is a big country in size and it has a lot of this cannon fodder that they send here. And this process, it can‚Äôt be very fast,‚Äù Danilov said.",fc05a83b11af717c642b5e6052ab3433f529d6ee,True,False,,,,,0,1654539074,,0,{},ibe6frj,True,t3_v69rga,False,True,t3_v69rga,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v69rga/ukraine_in_very_difficult_fight_after_russias/ibe6frj/,1654539086,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654510274.0,

As I see it, unless we can point to some modern instance of the Russian populace changing its government's direction, we should not plan on it doing so in this case and any actions or statements which might prolong the war by giving Putin hope the west *is* getting tired of supporting Ukraine are not worth it if their only potential benefit is getting some theoretical amount of the powerless Russian populace on the side of Ukraine (or against Putin). 

Basically, I understand that theoretically we can imagine a set of circumstances where Russian public opinion changes the outcome of the war. Practically, however, there is no evidence that even *if* opinion could be changed it would affect Putin's conduct of the war. There's no evidence historically, culturally, or politically (especially looking at the last 15-20 years) that opinion of ordinary Russians would affect how things go, or that the opinion of the majority can be changed to go against the line of state propaganda. 

As a practical matter, there will be no revolution in Russia over this war. There are no alternate power centers, there are no organization of armed people not under government control, and there is nothing like enough resources. There has not been a successful revolution against a modern military that immediately and overwhelmingly clamped down on the protests in the last 50 years. Russia very much clamps down on even the hint of protests to ensure they don't build to anything. If Russians weren't able to get fair elections 15 years ago when the state was much *less* clamped down and the west was much *more* supportive, when they could still mobilize tens of thousands into the streets, why would a less engaged, poorer, and more broken opposition without any leadership be able to do more against a more militarized and authoritarian state?

&gt; Much of the looted grain, according Ukrainian officials, ends up at ports like Sevastopol on the Crimean peninsula, which Russia has occupied since 2014.In late April, video surfaced of columns of covered trucks driving what Ukrainian officials said was captured grain.

&gt; Card 1 of 3.In an email, a State Department spokesman declined to comment on the cable&amp;#039;s contents, but pointed to the Ukrainian reports of wholesale grain theft, as well as &amp;quot;Numerous testimonies from Ukrainian farmers and documentary evidence showing Russia&amp;#039;s theft of Ukrainian grain.""

&gt; For many Ukrainians, the theft of the grain - and its unlawful export - recall the traumatic famine of 1932-33 when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, and Ukrainian peasants had their grain expropriated.

We are stronger, but most western armies except USA have greatly reduced their armoured and artillery forces. You would be hard pressed to put together more than a handful of divisions among the European countries . We do not keep thousands of tanks or artillery pieces in reserve anymore. Our armies are volunteers only, for the most part, and we would not be able to sustain dozens of thousands of casualties like Ukraine and Russia are doing right now. Our navies are much better, but controlling the Baltic or Mediterranean seas is not going to win the ground war. Aviation is better too, but we don't keep large bomber squadrons anymore, and our factories cannot be converted back to war production in a few days to replace losses. We cannot move an entire division from, say,  France to Estonia in less than 3 weeks even with a quite good road and railway network across of Europe. The Russian army could take the whole Baltic states in maybe 3 days without real opposition. Also, let's look honestly at the Russian situation right now. They lost what, 50 thousand soldiers? Some more? They could replace those in less than 6 months with twice more trained conscripts, if they needed to. Lost tanks will take longer, but realistically they could ramp up production and do it in 5 or 6 years, even with current restrictions on advanced components. Losses of artillery and logistic vehicles are not really catastrophic right now. And next time, they won't repeat the same mistakes, they aren't completely idiotic. They are learning already, like the Donbas situation is showing. WWII tactics, and a careful advance combined with local force superiority, are enough to slowly gain territory and push back the most motivated army in Europe right now. A few Himars and M777 are not really game changing, and no European army can field hundreds of them either. So, yes, we would certainly win in the end, but the cost for Europe would be astronomical if USA didn't help us.

Reports have emerged of Russian soldiers being resupplied with soggy lavatory paper and Soviet-era field telephones rather than modern weapons.

Ukrainian soldiers have regularly out-armed their opponents, often because of the advanced weaponry sent to them from Western allies and Ukraine‚Äôs own crowdfunding efforts.

An intercepted mobile phone conversation from mid-May shows Russian soldiers are becoming increasingly frustrated with Moscow‚Äôs supplies. 

‚ÄúThere is a lot of evergreen overgrowth here now. You can‚Äôt see anything. You need thermal imaging ‚Ä¶ but we have to buy everything ourselves,‚Äù a Russian soldier in Ukraine told another man in Russia. ‚ÄúThis army really is s---.‚Äù

For Sophia, the crowdfunding was more than just about resupplying soldiers. It was also about defending the ‚ÄúMotherland‚Äù, such as in World War II when Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union.

‚ÄúMore than 200 cities in Russia have been supporting our fighters since the beginning of the special operation because Russians do not abandon their own,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe love our Russian army.‚Äù",8b24cc57eeb0a0da5f7ee426390d5a6faf8d2932,True,False,,,,,0,1654537960,,0,{},ibe3u24,True,t3_v69c79,False,True,t1_ibe3td3,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v69c79/russians_turn_to_crowdfunding_for_illequipped/ibe3u24/,1654537974,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654509160.0,

**Everything from rifle scopes to boots have been sent to troops, paid for by ‚Äòpatriots‚Äô through fundraising initiatives**

Pro-war Russians are crowdfunding supplies for soldiers who have complained that Moscow has failed to arm them properly.

Everything from rifle scopes to boots for soldiers have been sent to Ukraine, paid for by patriotic Russians through fundraising initiatives. 
The grassroots campaign, backed by the Kremlin and its Telegram channels, has published photos of soldiers carrying civilian drones and radios, all purchased by ordinary Russians.

In Belgorod, south Russia, 35-year-old Sophia volunteers in a crowdfunding programme. She told The Telegraph that the success of the nationwide campaign showed that ‚Äúpatriotic Russians‚Äù supported Vladimir Putin‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine.

‚ÄúThe money comes in from all over the country,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSomebody might send 100 roubles (¬£1.26) and somebody else might send 100,000 roubles, it all helps.‚Äù

The Kremlin has banned dissent and talk of war, instead calling it a ‚Äúspecial operation‚Äù. It has also ramped up its propaganda drive, which is built around the twin notions Putin was forced to invade Ukraine to deal with a Nazi threat and that the invasion is going smoothly.

Sophia said that thermal imaging equipment and shovels were popular requests, but she denied that the Russian army was poorly equipped.

**Military ‚Äòthinking ahead‚Äô to avoid shortages**

‚ÄúThe military are special people,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey think ahead and often ask for reserves so that they can prevent shortages.‚Äù

Western intelligence, though, gives a different picture. It has said that the war has humiliated Russia and that at least 15,000 soldiers have died because of poor leadership, planning and equipment.",0713bb0a8b2e5f6d42bed7cbcf35eb374b97eaa6,True,False,,,,,0,1654537952,,0,{},ibe3td3,True,t3_v69c79,False,True,t3_v69c79,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v69c79/russians_turn_to_crowdfunding_for_illequipped/ibe3td3/,1654537966,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654509152.0,

Putin was born in 1952 - so after WWII but within the Cold War and the glamorization of the Soviet WWII victory. 

What I've noticed from trying to contact distant relatives on DNA genealogy websites trying to track down what happened to my great-grandfather's family in Russia &amp; Belarus is that Russians in that age bracket (people in their 50s and 60s) automatically assume anyone who they can't account for must have died in WWII.  They dismiss it was Stalin or anything else.  One family tree I found listed my great-grandfather as dying in WWII, rather than emigrating to the US.  When I contacted the person who made it (a Russian woman in her 50s outside Yaroslavl), she couldn't fathom that someone fled Russia due to the Bolsheviks. (estimates are over 2 million Russians fled)  It was bizarre trying to communicate with her. I assumed if I got in contact with distant cousins in Russia, they would know what happened to family members. But they really seem brainwashed that anything bad that happened between 1918-1960 was all due to Nazi Germany and not anything else.

But that does make sense if someone grew up in a world where so much emphasis is placed on what happened during WWII, and very little one anything else.

1753,[],False,,MosesZD,,,[],,,,text,t2_8ud9i,False,False,"&gt;\*Russian artillery is superior in quantity literally hundred fold and they can shoot at Ukraine for years without running out of ammunition.

No, not 'literally' hundred-fold.  At the beginning of the war Russia had about 18,500 pieces in it's entire stock.   Ukraine had 3,700.   That's about 5x.   Not, literally, a hundred-fold.  

Further, Russia cannot redeploy all of its artillery because they have other military deployment and defensive needs besides being embarrassed by Ukraine.  Theatre wide, the forces are probably equal and Ukraine, with modern NATO artillery, now out-ranges the Russians and has more accurate artillery.  Whereas early in the war, the Russians had the range on the Ukrainians.

And, of course, despite the huge stock, most of the Russian artillery is in storage (if it hasn't been stolen or sold for parts like so many of their reserve tanks that have disappeared from satellite images taken of their storage yards over the years).  They don't have that much they can bring to bear.   

Or let's put it this way, with army significantly larger, the US can't really deploy all of its 4.200 artillery pieces. There is no reason to believe the Russians can considering how small the combat portion of their army really is.

Next comes effective life.  Barrells wear out and the Russians don't have capability or capacity to refurbish them as Russia has become very dependent on the West to manufacture much of its equipment.  OTOH, the Ukrainians can just ship theirs out and have them refurbished, or just buy new barrels. 

With all these, and many more factors, it's clear to see that Russian artillery, despite your vast over-statement of its size, is going to effectively counter the Ukrainian artillery and that Russia will just be able to artillery-barrage their way across Ukraine.",fca08034e5f34f07e6f6c7f9e40ffe65967babdf,True,False,,,,,0,1654534980,,0,{},ibdwvpk,False,t3_v64est,False,True,t1_ibdifn6,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v64est/what_if_ukraine_wins_victory_in_the_war_would_not/ibdwvpk/,1654534997,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654506180.0,

&gt; In what is seen as a slap on Russia&amp;#039;s supposed prowess in the cyber warfare space, the collective has managed to - yet again - intrude into the bank&amp;#039;s cyber innards.

&gt; Unlike previous attacks, the Anonymous operative&amp;#039;s latest exploit allowed them to gain control of the &amp;quot;Russian software system&amp;quot; used in running the CBR. In addition to taking control of the system, the hacktivist also leaked some data that belongs to the central bank.

&gt; The Central Bank of Russia Federation did not confirm that it was hacked in March, and it is likely that it will confirm the latest intrusion.

In order for Ukraine to achieve a victory it would have to 1) utterly crush the Russian military within it's territory to such a point that the Russian military has to withdraw to pre-2014 borders and 2) Russia would not use nuclear weapons in response to an impending defeat of their conventional forces.

There was few facts I didnt know:

\*One of the most critical is that Ukraine has more soldiers than Russia twofold at this very moment. Russia has about 150 000 soldiers left, of which are 30 000 separatists with low military training. Ukraine has 200 000 elite soldiers, 50 000 National guards and 50 000 border guards, with about 100 000 reservists. In preparation there is still about 500 000 people.

\*Sieverodonetsk counter offensive dealt huge damage to Russian army and now they retreated back to safety in west in something like Azovstal. They will most likely do more counter attacks like that, minimal casulties and massive damage.

\*Melitopol is on the brink of fall due to guerilla wars.

\*Counter offensive northern from Kherson is to cut off Russian bridge Kherson-Crimea due to important railroads. If this happens, Kherson falls within weeks.

\*Railroads are only possible means of transport for Russians.

\*Ukraine needs 700 howitzers for serious counter offensive.

\*Putin cannot claim ""all mobilization"" or ""we are at war"" due to public outbreak, as Russians would directly feel the consequences.

\*Ukraine is heavily dependant on Western support. France, Germany and Italy are trying to negotiate peace at this stage, sacrificing territory for ""peace"". Russia might recover in few years and continue the attack.

\*Russian artillery is superior in quantity literally hundred fold and they can shoot at Ukraine for years without running out of ammunition.",0d55b69fd66901c27135a53a59c3bd06baa517a5,True,False,,,,,0,1654528769,,0,{},ibdifn6,False,t3_v64est,False,True,t3_v64est,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v64est/what_if_ukraine_wins_victory_in_the_war_would_not/ibdifn6/,1654528781,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654499969.0,

If such a humiliating defeat of Russian forces were to occur, there would inevitably be mass instability within Russia with coups, regional rebellions, etc. Such a loss will massively weaken the Russian state both in material and perception. All legitimacy of the existing regime will have vanished, and no new ruler will be able to quickly assume and consolidate firm centralized control over the vast state.  
  
Thus, the defeat of Russia in Ukraine could very likely lead to the dissolution of the Russian state as we know it, with significant potential for a civil war.  
  
In the midst of this chaos command and control of nukes will dissolve and we could see both the use of nuclear weapons by the various parties of the civil war against one another (i.e. within the collapsing Russian empire), as well as the sale of nukes to many parties around the world as various generals and war lords try and make a quick buck by selling off arms during the chaos.  
  
The great news for Ukraine is that such a collapse of the Russian empire will make it highly unlikely it will be attacked again in the foreseeable future. Even better, Ukraine will have a very good chance of purchasing nukes from one of the greedy Russian generals during the civil war period, and thereby be able to have a credible deterrent of its very own. Of course, there could be dozens of other nations that are able to acquire nukes in a similar way.

2574,[],False,,gooblaka1995,,,[],,,,text,t2_axrj2kb,False,False,"It's easy. We already do know exactly the reasons Russia is invading Ukraine.

First and foremost: Putin wants the proven natural gas and oil reserves on Ukraine's land and in their territorial waters. 

Putin and other Russian elites have been very upset that huge swaths of natural resources are no longer under their direct, centralized control (ever since the dissolution of the USSR).

Putin likes the money to be made from selling Europe its natural gas and other energy resources. It allows him to make exorbitant profits and exert political pressure over Europe during the winter when they need the natural gas the most.

Second: Putin yearns for a time when Russia was considered a global power that could exert influence over other nations (as well as having a Moscow based, heavily centralized political bloc).

Third: Putin is mad that he cannot puppet Ukraine like he does Belarus. If Ukraine is independent of his influence, it discredits him and undermines his perceived authority. (Also, if Ukraine joined the EU, the natural resources they possess would completely undermine and undercut his profits from his own natural resources).

Fourth: Racially motivated. Putin not only dislikes an independent, pro western Ukraine that has the potential to cut into his energy cartel profits, he also hates the idea of a Ukrainian national identity. Hence why he said Ukrainians are just Russians. If they viewed themselves as Russian, it gives him an easy claim over the region. It also allows for his propaganda of a united Russian peoples. This is why he is so adamant in destroying Ukrainian culture, forced abduction and assimilation of Ukrainian children into Russian culture, and of course the eventual banning of all Ukrainian cultural symbols, real or perceived, if he conquerors the region and/or puppets the nation.",eebb66adf44171cd757fc369207f684099f846ab,True,False,,,,,0,1654525333,,0,{},ibdb1f0,False,t3_v61075,False,True,t3_v61075,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v61075/survey_33_of_finlands_80000_russianspeakers/ibdb1f0/,1654525349,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654496533.0,

Which is frankly laughable, when you know, as someone else pointed it out, that modern style democracies are only fairly recent. 

Furthermore, the French,for example, fought 2 colonial wars, in Algeria and Vietnam, well into the 50 and 60. 

I suppose you haven't paused to reread yourself in order to notice, how idiotic this statement is 

&gt; colonialism has nothing to do with the structure of the &gt; government doing the colonizing.

I mean a group of people (government) holds another group of people(the colonized) ,with the main justification being white supremacy (their inability to govern themselves, since they're not civilized), as subject (they cannot determine their own fate). And then call themselves ""the free world"", is literally hypocrisy. There's  a difference between few white dudes writing about something and then that something being applied. Also you kinda have forgotten or didn't know, but one of the precepts of enlightenment is rationality and logic, something you obviously lack.

Which brings me to my other point. It doesn't take a fortuneteller to notice that you're probably an American, I mean the sheer level of arrogance and geopolitical ignorance that just oozes from that reply. The group you're identifying is the West and the USA. And how is it relevant? It's the hubris, the idea that you're living in a society with the best possible social structure, that makes you completely oblivious to any form of critical discussion of that system. I mean it isn't your fault, it's the system. And unlike the Russians, the West is pretty good at propaganda.

Oh and before you go off calling me a Russian troll, let me just tell you my stance on what should the West do in Ukraine. The West should directly intervene, and legally they could, according to the Budapest memorandum. Since they would be defending the values of self-determination, something you clearly don't understand. Instead they're trying to stretch this war out as long as possible, since human lives don't matter, unless it's your own constituents and wars are good for profit. Russians are winning? Ok here's more weapons, but just enough so you don't lose or win.

Russia is a dictatorship and everyone would be much safer if it wasn't a one. But don't paint an idealistic fantasy picture of the West, it's better than Russia, but isn't some captain America freedom for all fantasy world.

I don't know what either of those things are, so I'm going to guess that explains why we have a different set of understandings about how world history actually is, rather than how well it sells to children and the uninspired.

Never understood why people are so fascinated by equipment when it is the people who are important and far more interesting. Probably explains the gamification you were mentioning earlier. It's too much to ask people to understand complex international relationships when ""pew pew"" is available.

Again, your fundamental misunderstanding of scholarship is that you believe you can convince anyone if you can just come up with the correct ***ONE*** argument to explain everything.

A captured economy is a standard result of capitalism if it is left unregulated, and capitalists make it a habit to inhibit democratic processes to ensure they control the people making the regulations. Having a strong independent labor movement is the only way to combat that. I'm not arguing that the British empire was not corrupt to the core obviously.

&gt; If Ireland had a market free of colonial ownership then they would have owned their own land, and they would have reinvested the wealth locally, creating jobs and a middle class. This would have enabled further local ownership and ensured more local prosperity. That in turn would have expanded the food access and reduced dependency on a single food.

Shit it's almost as if the capitalist structure of that system of ownership was at the root of the problem. There are great similarities between feudal ownership of land and capitalist ownership of property/resources.

Correspondingly you have an increase in UAF losses, you like it or not.

In your theory, the experience of Versailles should have been predictive of disaster after WWII because we refused to give in to German demands. We took a total surrender, not even close to what supporters of Ukraine demand. In fact it is entire standard deviations away from what supports of Ukraine demand, which is just their land back. We offered a plan after they were brought low. Not one second before Hitler ate his gun would any of the Marshall Plan been considered. 

In your theory, we should have let Hitler live, with some of the territory he had taken, so he wouldn't be embarrassed. Clearly that was never a feasible solution at the time, and human nature is yet again proving that the attacked will *rarely* just accept being genocided.

He cheers for their victories but he's scathing when it comes to their failures. He's not dismissing this counter-attack as Ukrainian propaganda and he's doesn't believe the Russian official claims to still be in control of the town. He's waiting to hear from his own people there (he used to be the big cheese in the separatist areas, probably the guy behind the whole thing when it started back in 2014) before he can accurately gauge what happened. He's a war criminal bastard but I've been finding his opinion on the Russian war effort in Ukraine interesting to follow.

&gt;Russia is directly responsible for any deficits in international grain trade - Borrell

&gt;Russia, which has waged an unprovoked war against Ukraine, is fully responsible for the shortage of grain on the international market and the associated threats to global food security.

&gt;According to Censor.NET, EU High Representative Joseph Borrell wrote about this on Twitter on Sunday .

&gt;‚ÄùAggressive wars must not be allowed. EU sanctions are directed against Russia's ability to continue this war. They are not aimed at wheat. Agricultural products and their transportation are completely excluded from sanctions. Russia's constant blockade of Ukrainian ports hinders exports of tons of grain such as corn and wheat, wheat and wheat are currently blocked in Ukraine, which is one of the world's major producers, ""the statement said.

&gt;Borrel stressed that Russia is ""directly responsible for any deficits in international grain trade, and instead of stopping its aggression, is actively trying to shift responsibility for the food crisis to international sanctions. This is misinformation.""

&gt;Read on ""Censor.NET"": Putin pursues a policy aimed at destroying grain stocks to provoke global hunger - Borrell

&gt;""The EU will continue to show its full solidarity with countries around the world in overcoming the consequences of the war. President Putin must end the war against Ukraine.

The Ukrainian Armed Forces are assisted by 1.5,000 Bilorussian citizens in an attack on the Russian Federation.

Svitlana Tikhanovska spoke about this in an interview with the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, reports Censor.net with reference to UNIAN.

According to her, after the start of the full-scale invasion by the Russian Federation, many Belarusians wanted to help the Ukrainians and a battalion was formed.

""At the moment there are 1,500 men. In fact, it (the battalion - Ed.) is not alone: there are several of them in different cities, under the supervision of the Ukrainian army,"" she said.

Tikhanovska confirmed that the ranks of those willing to fight on the Ukrainian side continue to grow.

""Many in Belarus want to help Ukraine and are currently being trained in other countries. I am not allowed to say how many of them there are and where they are located. Often these are people who require training because they have no experience of war. But the number of Belarusian servicemen in the Ukrainian army will certainly grow,"" an opposition activist said.",f2d37485f7723aaf1e2e08bd07924d9ba37ce0e5,True,False,,,,,0,1654513869,,0,{},ibcrgg6,False,t3_v60sbq,False,True,t3_v60sbq,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v60sbq/15_thousand_belarusians_are_fighting_against/ibcrgg6/,1654513885,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654485069.0,

The Irish farmer employees didn't own their property, and they weren't deciding what to grow. 

The famine had three causes - the blight, the dependency on potatoes due to the small plots available from tenants to farm, and foreign landowners who didn't reinvest but rather remitted the money to England.
The last one is what you refer to when you speak of land lords -but you're not addressing the fact that the government (comprised or noblemen) wouldn't regulate themselves. This is a factor of aristocracy and not free markets.

If Ireland had a market free of colonial ownership then they would have owned their own land, and they would have reinvested the wealth locally, creating jobs and a middle class. This would have enabled further local ownership and ensured more local prosperity. That in turn would have expanded the food access and reduced dependency on a single food.

Russia would not feel threatened if Ukraine still had a corrupt^[1] puppet regime like Yanukovich, aligned with Moscow.

Putin's been working to destabilize Ukraine since the Maidan revolution, because the biggest threat to his regime is a prosperous, democratic country with close cultural ties^[2]  to Russia. The orcs are already impressed that they have paved roads in small villages, that they can afford Nutella, and they steal fucking toilets, presumably not because they live like kings in Buryatia.

Ukraine developing with EU funding, and prospering would be a nightmare for the rusnia kleptocracy.

They don't *need* Ukrainian resources; they just want Ukraine to be a failed state so they can tell their population ""see what happens when you don't have a master strategist in power?""

[1] Not to discount the fact that corruption still exists in Ukraine; it will take some time to fully eradicate it, just like in some of the newer EU countries.

I'm primarily interested in this because of the many Ukrainians I know and my interest in areas of the world around there. The thought of Russians massacring and raping in places where I've been sitting drinking and having locals buy me their food to try or invite me into their homes to feed me is horrific. This is even more so given that I have had many Russian friends as well and know that quite a number of them hate this war. 

At the same time, I regularly use the ""impose costs"" type arguments. I'm frankly deeply disappointed that the Syrians were unable to come up with a clearly secular united force that could be safely armed. The failure of the Georgians to properly use the weapons they were given was also terrible waste. The ""help those that help themselves"" argument is really strong.  Not only do Ukrainians effectively kill Russian murderers and rapists, they clearly accept surrender from those that are willing to give up making this one of the most moral chances there will be to solve the problem. They even make their own weapons when given resources and time. 

 What worries me most is insufficient kill ratio with too many Ukrainians dying for every Russian killed. My guess is around 2:1 or 3:1. I would like to see at least 10 Russians dead for every Ukrainian and preferably 100.  to send the weapons to the Balkans, Baltics or Taiwan depending on where Russia or China attacks first.  I accept that some of them have to be spread around in case of surprise attacks. That number should be limited.

Likely Putin ends up dead, either naturally and replaced by his chosen successor or through an assassination by one of his ""Loyal"" friends (how else could they get close). In either way, we have a high chance of ending up with another similar dictator facing the same problems and the logic that external warfare is a good distraction from internal problems.

Firstly, I'd say that there's no such sentiment in the UK _at all_. After things like the nerve agent attacks in Britain, Brits understand this talking with Russia clearly as the appeasement it is. This is not a general Western problem.

Secondly, I'd say you have to be really careful with what Macron says. Lots of things are attributed to him and said about him which are lies by the pro-Brexit (and thus Russian compromised) media in the UK. I know he discussed territorial trades _directly with Zelenski_ but I have seen no evidence that he's suggested the same to Putin or in public. 

A private discussion of realities with the Ukrainian leadership - ""you know we might not be able to help you all the way if Russia comes back stronger; what compromises do you think you will be able to live with"" is not the same as appeasement of Russia by making offers to them directly. 

It's really important to be careful with anti-French and anti-Macron sentiments.

This is not Putin's first defeat or even the first time he sent his top fighters to die. Look at the history of the Wagner group in Syria where Putin experimented with allowing them to attack the USA.

He has a history of experimenting, watching the result, stopping, retiring, learning, regrouping, rebuilding and trying again elsewhere with better results. 

The main hope from this is that Europeans and others worldwide suddenly came out of the ""End of History"" delusion and realized that if Russia and China are building massive armies then the people that they might attack have to have some way of matching them.

How? You and who's army? I can imagine the West imposing tariffs on Russian imports and exports, however China will almost certainly back Russia with the aim of gradually taking over control there. 

Ukraine's military will be maintained below that of Poland's, which is a good, and soon to be better, NATO army but no match for the UK, let alone France, and in the end just a holding force compared to the US army.

I don't see any way this will force Russia to change. That has to come from inside and is going to get more and more difficult.

&gt; A visit to Serbia by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has been cancelled after countries around the Balkan nation closed their airspace to his aircraft, according to media reports.

&gt; Serbia, which has close cultural ties with Russia, has fended off pressure to take sides over Russia&amp;#039;s invasion of Ukraine and has not joined Western sanctions against Moscow.

&gt; Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Serbian counterpart Aleksandar Vucic agreed last month that Russia would continue supplying natural gas to Serbia, while other countries have been cut off for refusing to pay for Russian gas in roubles.

I agree with what he says. 

&gt;Recently, I am often in Severodonetsk and its environs, and I am surprised by the repeated inadequate statements of some leaders regarding the operational situation in Luhansk region. On the day of President Zelensky's visit to the Luhansk region, the head of the Gaidai Armed Forces announced the offensive and liberation of 50% of the city. Unfortunately, this information is not true. 

&gt;In war, the enemy must be misled, not its citizens. ¬∞

&gt;In this case, Ukrainian society should receive information close to reality, we need real victories, not fictional ones. 

&gt;The risk of self-deception in war is that then under the guise of false fabrications and unjustified optimistic statements adjust units, people, and make decisions in ways that also do not correspond to the situation. Stop these word games, you don't have to. Ukrainian soldiers hold their positions in a difficult situation, and this situation requires, if not the whole truth, then at least the absence of lies. 

&gt;Otherwise, it is worrying whether managers understand what is happening. 

&gt;Two days ago, the enemy came out on the outskirts of the city, and now our troops are defending the Severodonetsk industrial zone and the adjacent quarter.

I think you need to study recent history and particularly Putin's actions and statements more. There's lots of messaging around 'Putin felt threatened' and 'NATO expansion threatens Russia'.  The important thing to know is that earlier on Putin himself was encouraging NATO expansion with the aim of Russia joining. He knows that NATO is a defensive alliance and so not a threat because the difficulty of invading countries after joining NATO will be part of why he didn't join.

A key thing here is the historic USSR and/or Russian empire and Putin's feeling, together with a number of Russian nationalists around him that it should be restored. 

However, that is only a part of the truth Putin's main true motivations are quite easy to see when you see where oil comes from and goes to and what the potential routes for transport are. Syria, Georgia, Armenia and Ukraine are all parts of those routes. 

Were Putin to succeed in all this war, there's little chance that he can stop there. War is his great distraction from the economic failure of modern Russia. If they have to rebuild into Ukraine, especially under sanctions, their economic problems will get worse. It is almost certain that the solution will be to invade the next place. The same will apply if he gets to some form of stalemate which allows him to claim partial victory.  He will regroup for 10 years and then continue until, at some point, probably once he feels ready with sufficient armaments he will trigger NATO article 5 and WWIII

The only possible route to world peace is the solid defeat of Russia. Even if you are Russian you should be rooting for this to save your own life and that of all your friends and family.

Yakovenko was placed in a pretrial detention centre, a press service representative of the border police said.

Viorel Tentiu, the head of Interpol in Moldova, said in a statement that Yakovenko was put on the list following accusations from Belarus of bribery and corruption.

A search of public records for wanted persons on the Interpol website for Yakovenko's name did not produce any results on Sunday night.

Ukraine and Belarus officials could not immediately be reached for comment.

Yakovenko was elected to the Ukrainian parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, from the Donetsk region, according to information on the parliament's website.

Fears have grown recently that Moldova could be drawn in to the conflict in neighbouring Ukraine, after pro-Russian separatists in a breakaway region reported a number of attacks and explosions there, which they blamed on Kyiv.¬†read more

What if a another country had tried to liberate the Indians from us, or what if a completely different country had tried to liberate those who were slaves in the us from the entire us? To the outside country it would be easy to see us as just the bad guy.. A bad guy today can be the good guy tomorrow.. as far as the war I think Putin felt threatened about losing some control and when people feel threatened they act for self preservation.. over the course of thousands of years guns, bombs, and money were all a bad idea because the are to gain control. 

One would think that since putin already controls a population that would have been enough to feed his desire for control of a people but with the neighbors joining and Ukraine wanting to join nato I think he feels like the nato allianced countries could attack him. He probably has psychological issue in the matter. However and on the flip side of that humanities solution is to use guns and weapons to destroy their enemies which begs the concern that control is/was/and may forever be the route downfall of us as a people.. 

If we ever populate another planet I wonder if we will take our failures and mistakes with us..

I think folks just want to live and not be at war not necessarily that they prefer their government though. I mean if they had to pick be at war or have their government Im sure they would say they would take their government‚Ä¶ if that were their only 2 choices in life that is.. 

Until then and for the sake of this thread I do hope that Ukraine and Russia can end their conflict.

We need to learn from the past, this is an enemy that wants the destruction of the west, they have decided that this is an existential battle. We didn‚Äôt want this, they brought it to us, and now we have no choice but to view it in the same way. This is the same mistake that we made with Hitler. Avoiding direct conflict now just means that it will be inevitable later, but later means it will be far more painful because they‚Äôll have had time to coalesce, strengthen themselves, and learn from their mistakes. They won‚Äôt lose their ambition, and this loss is going to do more to strength Russian chauvinism and internal support than it will to weaken it if we do not finish it with a denazification-of-Germanyesque level of control and deprogramming. 

If we let these animals crawl back into their lair and lick their wounds they will be supported and strengthened by China, and when the next moment is opportune and the West is weakened, they will attack, and you can be sure that they will not show the same graciousness, regard for human life, or mercy, that you want to show them now. 

This is the best chance we will ever have to strike a major, potentially fatal blow, to the authoritarian, aliberal forces that lurk in the East and seek the destruction of the West and democratic governments (i.e., Russia, China). Depriving China of Russia, of Russia‚Äôs resources, and vitally, of Russian‚Äôs direct access to geopolitically and strategically important land masses and a direct, massive land barrier with the West is perhaps the most important and deciding battle we need to have of the 21st century. 


I agree that world war and global scale conflict, especially with nuclear weapons, must be avoided to the maximum extant possible. Right now, China has made it clear that they are unwilling to engage in such a battle, Russia is the weakest that it will be in our lifetimes, and we have our Casus Belli. This is the moment, a deciding juncture in history, and we cannot back down. We need to look beyond just our immediate circumstances and look at the bigger picture.

But then my second thought is: if the goal of a Marshall-esque Plan is to prevent Russia from turning into Germany of about a century ago - sorry, too late!  That's just their (very!) longstanding national identity: they've been an utterly brutal, genocidal imperial power with global ambitions since well before Germany dabbled with that, and have remained so pretty much to this day, with perhaps a brief pause during the anomalous Gorbachev years which filled most of us with false hope.

Or from the other angle: how could harsh treatment make them even worse?

The only answers my feeble imagination offers are that it'd suck if Russia retained its same essential ambitions and brutal complete disregard for the lives of others, but somehow :

(a) got its corruption under control and became more effective, and/or

(b) became so nihilistic that it really would start launching nukes at the drop of a hat, mutually-assured self destruction be damned, and not merely talk about it hourly.

Like the dictatorship that runs them, the command structure is highly authoritarian.   Orders are to be obeyed without question, low level officers are not trusted to make decisions. 

This is why we see Russian soldiers throwing themselves repeatedly into the various Ukranian meat grinders.  Morale is ridiculously low, and combat effectiveness is abysmal. 

It's a strategy that works well enough when you're winning easily, and falls apart with the slightest disruption.  Because this chain of command results in very weak front line leadership, Russia has no choice but to send Generals to the front lines to enforce authority and keep the conscripts marching into the meat grinders.   That's why they're such an easy target and they're dropping like flies. 

Ukraine started training in more Western/NATO doctrine for many years before this happens.  This doctrine empowers NCOs and low level officers with tactical decsion making, they're provided broad strategic objectives but have signfiicant autonomy in the tactical solution, and they're free to adapt on the fly.

Note that Russia has been trying to kill Zelenskyy from day one of this war and failed. If Putin had the opportunity he would take it and try to kill Zelenskyy or other important Ukrainian leadership.

It is functionally impossible to have systems in place to intercept an SLBM on launch. Their range is too great, and physics is a thing. Physics is also why it's near impossible to effectively intercept their warheads.

Mirv's exist, and you can have up to 12 warheads on a single SLBM. They'll be moving at incredible speeds, which makes it even harder to intercept. That's assuming you can accurately guess where they were landing. 

That's why nations adopted a launch on detection strategy.",329526440f66ea48b3e37034e28249b8e590b561,True,False,,,,,0,1654489934,,0,{},ibbzk5m,False,t3_v5dusb,False,True,t1_ibbmndq,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v5dusb/russian_artillery_firing_at_ukraine_from_russian/ibbzk5m/,1654489946,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654461134.0,

&gt; HELSINKI - NATO kicked off nearly a two-week U.S.-led naval exercise on the Baltic Sea on Sunday with more than 7,000 sailors, airmen and marines from 16 nations, including two aspiring to join the military alliance, Finland and Sweden.

&gt; He said from Moscow&amp;#039;s perspective, Finland and Sweden joining NATO will be &amp;quot;Very problematic&amp;quot; and leave Russia in a difficult military position as the Baltic Sea&amp;#039;s coastline would be almost completely encircled by NATO members, except for Russia&amp;#039;s Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad and the Russian city of St. Petersburg and its surrounding areas.

&gt; Turkey, a NATO member that has had good relations with Russia, has objected to Finland and Sweden joining the military alliance, citing their alleged support for a Kurdish group that Turkey labels as terrorist.

See [here](https://www.lexico.com/definition/culture) and [here](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/culture). You're using 'culture' to mean ""the general state of the economy, political and justice systems"", and that's not only wrong, but it's the root cause of your entire argument.

Obviously you have freedom of speech; you can use whatever words you like, but this basic mistake is why people are disagreeing with you.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Yes, of course.

...and it's leading to opinions like this. If you genuinely believe ""British culture"" is more to blame for that conflict than the actual, specific reasons I highlighted, you have no idea what the word 'culture' means. The same applies to many of your other comments, e.g. on Mexico.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Why do you think there are fewer drug gang related decapitations in US and Canada? Just because they had better geopolitical luck? Sometimes luck is what you make for yourself. You cannot say that US was always lucky

The US has had one of the easiest, luckiest existences of any country in global history. They were settled by a technologically advanced people on the edge of a gigantic, very lowly populated landmass rich in water, fertile agricultural land and natural resources. Their only opponents were small numbers of technologically backward natives. They have two huge oceans protecting them, their only neighbour to the north was a fellow British colony and peaceful country, their only neighbour to the south was weak, corrupt and dysfunctional. They were able to buy gigantic amounts of valuable land at a very good price because France desperately needed the money. Even their colonial master was knee-capped during their independence war by rival European colonial powers. As the US rose to dominance, every potential rival was busy fighting (and crippling) themselves during devastating world wars. The worst thing to ever happen to America was self-inflicted (their own civil war).

The USA is a *terrible* example of the idea that ""you make your own luck."" No, you don't. Countries are products of their environment. Afghanistan is invaded by technologically superior superpowers every few decades.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That's exactly when you can talk about culture

But not in terms of a specific conflict, that's the point.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Everybody is their own person based on their merits and faults not based on various groups they are part of (especially when belonging to the group is not a voluntary thing).

I'm glad we 100% agree.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Yes, of course, even now there are shitty elements about American culture, but as a whole is much less shittier than Iraq, or Afghanistan, or Mexico, unless you perhaps have another opinion?

I think the general political, economic and judicial state of the USA is clearly superior to Iraq, Mexico and Afghanistan. But that's not because ""American culture"" is superior. Again, we come back to what that word means.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I haven't even touched onto the ""why""

Which is exactly the problem. Declaring a place to have inferior culture due to xyz conflicts but making neither effort to understand, nor willingless to accept, the ""why"". If you don't know or care about the ""why"", then by definition how can you make any conclusions about the culture?

France could get hit by a meteor tomorrow and be reduced to an apocalyptic wasteland. It would be crazy to say ""French culture is clearly shit"" without bothering to account for the giant rock hitting them from outer space.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Think about Japan or Germany after the WWII

It's almost as if having a stable geo-strategic situation, unconditional military protection delivered by the USA, decades of peace, gigantic marshall plan aid, a long history of strong institutions, a highly literate and well educated population, and a foreign power to forcefully clean up your political systems and prevent violent non-state groups from spreading is helpful.",52e1c0fe98ebff6a95f850c2b0006c5923a2149c,True,False,,,,,0,1654484460,,0,{},ibbqu9d,False,t3_v4jkzh,False,True,t1_ib7hypz,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v4jkzh/bond_between_americans_and_ukrainian_forces_they/ibbqu9d/,1654484477,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654455660.0,

Basically, Ukraine poses a threat to Russia's hydrocarbon monopoly on Europe because Western oil companies are funding projects in former Soviet states like Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan with the pipelines planned to run through Ukraine.  Also, one of Russia's largest pipelines to Europe already runs through Ukraine.  And Ukraine was beginning to develop its own eastern oil and gas fields (located, you guessed it, in Donbas).

When Russia had Poroshenko in power, and then Trump in office, they could use those tools to obfuscate former Soviet states from challenging their energy monopoly.

With Biden and Zelenskyy in office, Putin had to take more violent measures.

&gt; KYIV, Ukraine - Russia took aim Sunday at Western military supplies for Ukraine, launching airstrikes on Kyiv that it claimed destroyed tanks donated from abroad, as Vladimir Putin warned that any Western deliveries of longer-range rocket systems would prompt Moscow to hit &amp;quot;Objects that we haven&amp;#039;t yet struck.""

&gt; The Russian Defense Ministry said air-launched precision missiles were used to destroy workshops in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, including in Druzhkivka, that were repairing damaged Ukrainian military equipment.

&gt; Ukraine&amp;#039;s General Staff said Russian forces fired five X-22 cruise missiles from the Caspian Sea toward Kyiv, and one was destroyed by air defenses.

Turkish operations in Syria are not as clear cut and there are multiple reasons for the tank losses. It mostly boils down to the infantry force used, that force being the much less trained TFSA Syrian militias to keep the Turkish losses low. 

Another reason was the antiquated tactics employed and not seeing that the region was full to the brim with atgms of all kinds. 

As for operation against ISIS in 2016, which saw the biggest tank losses and not the ones against YPG, that same army was in a coup attempt 3 months ago and some cadre was lost in the purges, so it was a troublesome time. 

You go to war with the army you have. Even with all that, operation against ISIS was a resounding success, at the cost of more than 60 Turkish KIAs. 

In the following operations tank crews got used to operating in such an atgm heavy theater and losses decreased. Modernization programs for tanks were started, etc.

In 2015 that company sold 38 of those to Indonesia.

Belgium tried to by back the 26 remaining  to ship them to Ukraine but the the company asked a 10 fold of what they bought them for.

Meanwhile they are sold. 

Maybe Ukraine paid more then Belgium and bought them.
