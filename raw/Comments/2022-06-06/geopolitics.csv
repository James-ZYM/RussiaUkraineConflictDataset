&gt; Despite the carnage that has been inflicted on the people of Kharkiv, they say that their relatives in Russia refuse to believe that anything untoward has happened to them. The irony, Galina says, is that “Kharkiv is — or at least was ― a pro-Russian city! Everyone here speaks Russian and has family over the border.” But now sympathies for Russia have evaporated, replaced with burning hatred. Perhaps unexpectedly, it is here in the Russian-speaking east that you hear the most passionate denunciations of Putin and the Russian attack on Ukraine.

&gt; Animosity toward Russia has sharpened among people in the east for two main reasons. First, eastern Ukraine has borne the brunt of the indiscriminate destruction that Putin has unleashed. Kharkiv and Mariupol have suffered brutal and cruel bombardments. The second factor is proximity to Russia — and not just in geographical and cultural terms. For many, this feels like a deep family betrayal, as if it is their siblings and cousins firing the shots. In some cases, it is.

It's not a civilian war. Local Russian puppets kidnapping men off the streets in Donbas and treating them as disposable with little training and ancient weapons.

I would not characterise my position as denialism. Denialism  implies discomfort or irrational dislike of the truth. I appreciate geopolitics. I don't discuss this topic because I think Russia or Ukraine has a right to win, or ought to lose, or any kind of personal investment in the outcome. 

I will admit that I am *highly* sceptical. Unless I see the source of this photo and can then verify that its not Ukrainian, not DPR or LPR, and that its actively involved in front line duties that ought to be done by T-72's, I'll not make any assumptions. I pointed out the possibility that the T-62 might be useful for garrison duty or for holding checkpoints. 1/5th of Ukraine is larger than all of Austria. T-62's are cheap and reliable, Russian's have a long history of using cheap, reliable, but admittedly outdated equipment. 

Regarding the grim picture of the Russian Army, sure...I can see that picture being painted.  My point is that you can make as many calculations as you like, but unless you are confident in your inputs you cannot be confident in the outputs. I simply am not confident enough or trusting enough of either sides propaganda to make such calculations. At the end of the day, I don't care to theorise on whether Russia is truly running out of T-72s or whether they are simply ensuring they have enough in reserve in the event of escalation or whether they simply determined that the T-62 was a conveniently cheap solution or even whether the T-62's were just nearby (Russia is big...)

I see Kiev is still under Ukrainian Control. That's a fact. 

I see most of Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia under Russian Control, with significant gains in Donetsk. That's also a fact. 

Ongoing conflicts are a pain to predict. The propaganda is wild. I'm simply too sceptical to look at a few abandoned vehicles and start hooting about the imminent collapse of the Russian Army. I can draw some preliminary conclusions that Russian logistics are sorely lacking. But anything substantially more exciting than that would be me attempting to twist the facts to suit my theories, as opposed to forming theories based on the facts. My current 'theory of the case' is based on where the front line currently is, where the troops currently are, and how the war appears to have evolved into an artillery war based on reports from both sides and nature of the terrain in Donbass.",a6b2cbc0e004438ca1cee39a1954f8b02cf62cb7,True,False,,,,,0,1654558485,,0,{},ibfdek4,False,t3_v61j7c,False,True,t1_ibf60dr,/r/geopolitics/comments/v61j7c/climbing_the_ladder_how_the_west_can_manage/ibfdek4/,1654558500,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1654529685.0
[],False,,exoriare,,,[],,,,text,t2_7n1sq,False,False,"&gt; There was no coup in Ukraine, their president tried to quell protests against his policy by force and then run away.

""They are trying to scare me. I have no intention of leaving the country. I am not going to resign, I'm the legitimately elected president,"" he said, looking shaken. ""Everything happening today is, to a large extent, vandalism and banditry and a coup d'état. I will do everything to protect my country from breakup, to stop bloodshed.""

 -- That was Yanukovych after [being deposed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/22/ukraine-president-yanukovych-flees-kiev). But that's the problem with a coup - the supporters of a coup always find some reason not to call it a coup. 

&gt; And I am not talking about going with what the protesters say but for example doing a referendum, pushing the can down the road, or proposing a compromise.

That's precisely what Yanukovych did. He agreed to early Presidential elections. He agreed to pull back the security troops. [He agreed to everything the opposition had demanded.](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2014/02/21/yanukovych-agrees-to-early-vote-in-bid-to-end-crisis-i). 

And remember, this was a guy who'd already won the bogus 2004 election [where the US spent $14M to beat him](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/nov/26/ukraine.usa) then cried foul when their guy didn't win.  According to Victoria Nuland, the US spent $5B on helping the pro-EU, pro-West side to take control. 

&gt; And support from the West was tenuous at best, to change the outcome the West would need to actively reject Ukraine. That would be not only against interests of the West but also against popular opinion (in the West).

Yanukovych's 2010 election was deemed fair by the OSCE. Endorsing the violent removal of an elected leader should have given the West pause. The US spent a decade trying to help the Saudis return Yemen's elected President to power after he was forced to flee. Why was Yemen's election so sacrosanct, while Ukraine's was not? 

&gt;Bosnia is a failed state with no future and most of it's young population in the EU. According to polls Ukrainians prefer the current situation to that (with more support for fighting the closer You get to the front lines).

What matters is that Bosnians and Kosovars and Serbs aren't fighting and dying and killing each other. Within a generation or so, all of these borders will probably be irrelevant, but the goal is to stop the fighting now. If people want to live in a throwback rump state like Transnistria, we should let them do their thing. 

&gt; Ukraine's status quo before the Russian full scale invasion was better for both the Donbas and the rest of Ukraine. Outright annexation by Russia of the DNR and LNR (in their occupied borders) would be the way forward if Russia was interested in the well being of people living there

You're describing what would have eventually happened under Minsk, which was agreed to by everyone except Kiev's nationalist factions. And yes, if we'd done that we could have probably resolved Kosovo and everything else, all according to a process of law. 

&gt; But that was to little for Russia, they decided that Ukraine if out of the Russian sphere it had to be destroyed and now we are here.

Russia hasn't even destroyed the Rada building. Ukraine still has electricity. There haven't even been any vengeance bombings of the sort that central Donestsk is subjected to. Yes, Russia wants to wreck Ukraine as a unitary hostile state. So long as Galician nationalists can play a pivotal role, Russia will insist on federalism and demilitarization, but there's no racial animus from Russians when it comes to Ukrainians - there's no flipside of OUN vilification as subhumans. 

&gt; Russia is mostly interested on putting checks on their neighbors not in attaining a situation where the people involved can prosper. The only place they actually invested is Chechenya.

I agree that these rump states are one of the few cards Russia can play to stall NATO expansionism, but I think there are a few countries in the world that have managed to prosper without NATO. So maybe the solution is to figure out some mechanism for security guarantees that doesn't involve NATO expansion. (but we only need that if we genuinely care about these places prospering, and aren't cynically using them for power politics). 

&gt; Now after years Ukraine tried to do the same. All Russia's issues come from the fact that their kleptocracy stole what was left from the Soviet Union and got completely outcompeted as partner that is worth do business with not only by the West as whole but even by their former slaves in Central Eastern Europe.

Yes, Russia started over from scratch 20 years ago after their disastrous experiment with the prescribed ""shock therapy"". Yes, they are much farther behind than countries that didn't go through Commie hell. 

What I have a problem with is Western Triumphalism. In 2013, Russia suggested a compromise on Ukraine - maybe they could preserve their trade relationship with CIS, and still pursue membership in the EU. This would have preserved the strong ties Russia had with Donbas, while still allowing Western Ukraine to puruse its vision of a future in the EU. 

And the EU said NO. ""It is against our rules."" 

That was where this maelstrom started - when the EU said Ukraine had to go all one way or all the other. That was where the historic split between East and West got exploited. And the expectation was that the West would drag Donbas kicking and screaming out of their Russian bosom, but they'd have no choice. 

And it would have probably worked, if we hadn't let it come down to a single coup.",868656ffca9f02d5b1e24f74369dd26d92b0272f,True,False,,,,,0,1654558484,,0,{},ibfdeg3,False,t3_v61j7c,False,True,t1_ibf1s1n,/r/geopolitics/comments/v61j7c/climbing_the_ladder_how_the_west_can_manage/ibfdeg3/,1654558500,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1654529684.0
[],False,,GrAdmThrwn,,,[],,,,text,t2_v46ip,False,False,"Sure, although there are a number of factors that we can use to differentiate this from the Afghan War. For example, the terrain in Afghanistan is completely different, the distance to Moscow far greater, the ethnic and linguistic boundaries between the invaders and the natives much more impactful. 
And even then, the war lasted 9 years and it took a change of government to really make the Soviets withdraw. 

By contrast, Ukraine's terrain is much more friendly and much more familiar, the distance to Moscow is not only easier on logistics but also easier to justify in the hearts and minds of the soldiers and people, and the ethnic and linguistic boundaries are much easier to traverse and in some cases, barely there, making it much easier to recruit spies, soldiers and supporters from the local population, something which appears to be happening as there are no extensive reports of post-conquest resistance in Kherson, Melitopol, Mariupol or Berdyansk. 

As for casualties, until the war is over, I don't see much point in basing any assumptions on that. The Ukrainian's have put out some pretty wild figures, as have the Russians. I've seen estimates of both sides casualties that seem to be either unrealistic or conflating the word casualties with killed (as casualties include surrenders, injured, deserters, etc). If the Russian Army is still taking territory and inflicting casualties on the Ukrainians, then I won't be making assumptions on when they will finally run out of men. Keep in mind, early in the war there were all sorts of optimistic predictions. Based in some media pieces I'm pretty sure at this point we are over a month or so past the point when the Russian Army has run out of fuel, munitions, trucks, tanks, money and people. 

Patience with Hungary for acting in their own economic interests can wear thin, just as patience with Turkey or Croatia for blocking Sweden and Finlands membership to NATO (again, for their own national interests) can wear thin. But what can we actually do about it? Sanction them too? Kick them out of the alliance? Exert tit for tat political pressure on them? That is a recipe for disaster, so unfortunately, the internal divisions of NATO and the differences in member states unique national interests will only begin to assert themselves more as this conflict drags on and the consequences become more apparent. 

Hmmm...I think if Putin was overthrown tomorrow, or had he been overthrown a year or two ago, unless he was replaced by a US puppet, this war would still happen. Ultimately this was far more than just Putin waking up in February and deciding to just roll the dice. The factors that contribute to this war are so numerous that there wasn't even a point in debating the if, only the how and when. It could have been more limited in scope, if Russia could organize a coup and flip Ukraine with minimal direct military involvement. It could have been far greater in scope, with mass mobilisation and a large scale strategic bombardment preceding the invasion. But either way, Russia was going to intervene in Donbass and secure the water for Crimea and coopt or dismantle the Ukrainian Army and on and on and on. The fact that its still ongoing, months after being disconnected from Swift and having their foreign reserves confiscated, indicates to me that the stakes were always this high from their perspective and we are entering into a proxy war where we don't truly appreciate where the other sides redline truly is.

Ukraine doesn't field any. And the picture was easily geolocated to its position behind Russian lines. As for saying it could've been there since 2014...that's pretty laughable considering its nowhere near the areas of prior fighting nor were T-62s even used.

This is just straight up denialism at this point. There's plenty of evidence Russia is pressing the T-62 into service now.

It's not really guesses. The fact that russia is deploying T-62s *at all* means they don't have spare T-72s or T-64s to replace combat losses.

Just that fact alone allows people to calculate the remaining stocks of modern Russian tanks (and, at the same time, make a rough estimation of how many Russian tanks are in an unusuable state).",f2b4be3310fe5b386d9b7b29bffa2d59bd3f720c,True,False,,,,,0,1654554824,,0,{},ibf60dr,False,t3_v61j7c,False,True,t1_ibf5h65,/r/geopolitics/comments/v61j7c/climbing_the_ladder_how_the_west_can_manage/ibf60dr/,1654554835,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1654526024.0

If the artillery is still firing and the various conflict maps keep updating, then I'll not make assumptions. I prefer to look at which units are deployed where, whether they are regulars, volunteers, conscripts or territorial defense, when the maps change and when multiple maps show the same lines of control, and when both sides make statements that align.

[],False,,old_faraon,,,[],,,,text,t2_ddaqw,False,False,"&gt;You're right. If we'd known it would come to this, the West probably wouldn't have supported the 2014 coup in the first place. 

There was no coup in Ukraine, their president tried to quell protests against his policy by force and then run away. If your policy is so unpopular to bring a hundreds of thousands people to the streets in winter then maybe You should reconsider. And I am not talking about going with what the protesters say but for example doing a referendum, pushing the can down the road, or proposing a compromise. Yanukovych tried to force a solution on the country that was so widely unpopular that people protested. And the used excessive force protests. He probably would have been impeached if he didn't run away before. 

Coups are organized beforehand not after. 

And support from the West was tenuous at best, to change the outcome the West would need to actively reject Ukraine. That would be not only against interests of the West but also against popular opinion (in the West). 

&gt; The process we used to resolve the Yugoslav wars is about the best we've come up with (and that conflict involved even more bitter hatred based on creed, ethnicity and historical grievances). 

Croatia won it's war of independence with military operations (with Krajina Serbs escaping, which might be one of few examples of self imposed ethnic cleansing). Bosnia is a failed state with no future and most of it's young population in the EU. According to polls Ukrainians prefer the current situation to that (with more support for fighting the closer You get to the front lines). 

Ukraine's status quo before the Russian full scale invasion was better for both the Donbas and the rest of Ukraine. Outright annexation by Russia of the DNR and LNR (in their occupied borders) would be the way forward if Russia was interested in the well being of people living there. Ukraine could do nothing and would have to put that to rest to join the EU. But that was to little for Russia, they decided that Ukraine if out of the Russian sphere it had to be destroyed and now we are here. 

&gt; Russia hasn't shown much regard for viability - they're more motivated by culture and historic bonds. Transnistria has asked to be annexed by Russia for 30 years. 

And they haven't been accepted because the current situation is preferable for Russia. Crimea was because of it's strategic importance. The rest of Russian supported breakaways  the best they can get is a Russian passport and emigration because Russia will niether take then or let them be reabsorbed by their de jure countries (in whatever process might be developed to safeguard their autonomy). Russia is mostly interested on putting checks on their neighbors not in attaining a situation where the people involved can prosper. The only place they actually invested is Chechenya. 

&gt;Girkin was in Donbas in 2014

He was not the only Russian plant there just the only one that survived till today, surprisingly most where taken out by Russia themselves.

&gt;If we had any decency whatsoever, we'd be earnestly trying to figure out ways to solve what are the minor issues created by such a colossal collapse rather than just screaming ""me, me, mine"".

Former Warsaw pact countries solved those issues when they joined the rest of Europe in trade and modernized (including fighting corruption). Now after years Ukraine tried to do the same. All Russia's issues come from the fact that their kleptocracy stole what was left from the  Soviet Union and got completely outcompeted as partner that is worth do business with not only by the West as whole but even by their former slaves in Central Eastern Europe. It wasn't western machinations that did it, it was Russians that rule Russia that brought this on. 

&gt; They could have fought - it could easily have been a complete bloodbath and nuclear war. 

They fought just with each other, Nagorno Karabach, Osetia, Abkhazia, Chechenia.

If You mean fight the West they could have burned the world that's true. But it takes some special people for that king of extended suicide. And as for a conventional war, the Soviet Union would have to first fight the rest of the Warsaw Pact before it even came to blows with NATO.",6c572a3cd16bfba32d87359ee088af2632f18925,True,False,,,,,0,1654552827,,0,{},ibf1s1n,False,t3_v61j7c,False,True,t1_ibenw9r,/r/geopolitics/comments/v61j7c/climbing_the_ladder_how_the_west_can_manage/ibf1s1n/,1654552841,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1654524027.0

To be seen as valid, a referendum requires monitors from third-parties. In Europe, this is usually the OSCE. The OSCE refused to participate in any referendum that didn't have Kiev's blessing (and rightly so). Without the participation of all stakeholders, any referendum is illegal and irrelevant (and again, rightly so). 

&gt; Russia is not interested in fair referendums and splitting these territories along lines that would end up with. Mostly because those territories are not viable in the those borders. That's why Russia is set on conquering outside those lines.

Transnistria is about the most untenable rump state imaginable, but Russia has supported it for 30 years. They haven't militarized it, and it has no discernable strategic value (other than the world's largest cache of long-expired Soviet ammunition).

That has never been a productive approach. It's like saying ""Biden Laden attacked us for our freedoms"".

I strongly disagree with this. States are almost never truthful about their real reasons for pursuing a conflict. They publicly state the reason they think they can sell best to their own population. That's why Iraq was about WMDs, and not middle eastern oil. And that's why Russia is selling this idea of self-determination for Russian Ukrainians, instead of whatever the real reason is.

It's entirely possible that in the negotiations they've already tried they've realized that the Russian position is inflexible. I don't disagree that negotiations should be tried if they'd lead to an acceptable outcome, but we should also be equally open to the possibility that Russia has already been clear that an acceptable outcome is impossible.

I agree that China reliance on Gulf State gas is a powerful lever for the West. 

I also agree that the Saudi's and Israel see a conflict with Iran as inevitable and would like to take it on their terms. My argument was more that the West will never agree to help the Saudis in an aggressive action against Iran. 

It would be very hard for the Saudis to economically pivot to China in terms of a store of capital. Sure, they'll take Chinese weapons and security guarantees, and I'm sure they'd like to diversify their assets away from a majority of western reserves, but China's capital market don't offer a means to store economic value like the West does.

Economically, it's just not possible unless China decides to completely reform their capital markets, and I think that's highly unlikely. 

I agree that this conflict is mainly a conflict about Russian decline, and the goal of the West should be to manage that decline to the softest possible landing. Maybe you're right that the softest landing would be to let Russia rewrite the security policies for Ukraine (and Poland and the baltic state) like they asked to do back in December.

&gt;  control over the largest Russian speaking population outside of Russia (at a time when native Russians are experiencing a demographic collapse

There's no significant difference in demographics between Donbas and Russia. There's a lot of old people there. And the Baltic States are even worse - the *average* age is 42.7. You don't get much of a leg up on the future by taking over post-menopausal countries, so I think that again shows us that it's nonsense. 

&gt; If that's the case, negotiations could be counter-productive if Putin is not negotiating in good faith.

That's the way negotiations always work. You try to solve the issues. If one party suddenly says ""oh also we want rights to Black Sea gas"", then obviously you stop negotiating. But having a war today over something that might happen tomorrow is not a prescription for anything but endless wars. 

&gt; China is also an incredibly complex factor in any gulf politics. They are utterly reliant on the gulf states for energy and have a heavy incentive in the stability of the region.

The West is better off with China being reliant on Gulf oil. What should horrify us is the prospect of Russia and China creating an energy bloc. So long as China needs GCC oil, those supplies can be interdicted. 

&gt;  The Saudi oil fields are geographically way too close to Iran, and any conflict between the two states would have such a high risk of threatening that production.

The Saudis *want* a war with Iran. And Israel too. They're willing to sacrifice some of the world's energy security in the short-term to solve what they see as a long-term threat. 

Our other danger now is that the Saudis could pivot to China (which I fear has already started happening). Part of this is economic (if you're a sheik and you see Russian reserves being seized, you don't need much imagination to see that happening to your own regime). Part of it is China's agnosticism toward universal human rights. China would be fine if KSA took away women's driving licenses. They make a much more natural ally for GCC states than the West does with our progressive social mores. 

To my mind, Russia has already lost this war. They knew they'd lose it going in, but they did it anyway because they felt they had no choice. That's Russian fatalism - they see a good chance that this conflict will devolve into WW3. Ukraine is their last chance to grasp what strategic options they had left and force a confrontation on terms that don't force them into the Manichean choice of accepting either capitulation or annihilating the planet. 

The only other faction that needs to lose are the war mongers in the West - the hawks who have been pushing NATO bases and missiles eastward for 15 years now.

Your point about a food crisis is a good one, but sadly I don't think will impact the calculus much as far as supporting Ukraine as the countries most impacted by food and fertilizer shortages do not have much geopolitical power. 

The energy crisis is much more likely to have a real impact and Germany is probably the biggest flashpoint, as they have a dedicated underwater source of energy through Nord Stream that the Russians can use as leverage on Germany to try to split them from the greater European consensus. 

I think the real questions for NATO's continuing support is what the internal NATO calculus is on Russia's long terms aims. A proxy war in Ukraine is more manageable than a direct conflict if they think there's even a small chance that if after Russia takes Ukraine that they'll next aim at a NATO country.

This is bureaucrat-speak for ""we have no ideas except for escalation"". Such people are recklessly insane and should be gently escorted away from any access to power. 

Russia wants a referendum in Ukraine, with each region voting for whether they stay in Ukraine, or gain autonomy, or gain independence (which presumably will entail joining Russia in some cases). This is similar to how we resolved Kosovo and Yugoslavia and successfully ended those conflicts. Borders are important, but once as much blood has been spilled in Ukraine as in 2014 and 2015, those borders should take second priority. We already agreed to this in Minsk, Kiev just failed to implement it due to an internal power struggle. That's okay - Serbia couldn't abandon its claims without external help either. 

If we do this right (by including Transcarpathia in the process), it's not about Putin winning - it's about the nationalists losing. 

&gt; maintain the presence of recent reinforcements on NATO’s eastern flank for the near term (3–5 years);

&gt; strengthen tactical nuclear systems in Europe to enhance deterrence;

This kind of thinking is half of what precipitated the crisis. Deploying tactical nukes has been a goal of the US hawks for a *long* time. They believe that they can pull off regime change in Russia and that a limited nuclear war is winnable. And these aren't cranks - this has been the doctrine of PNAC/CNAS for 30 years now. These are the same people who gave us the humanitarian miracles of the Iraq Invasion and regime change - literally every time they get their way, they leave behind a legacy of ashes. The only ones who thrive are the defense contractors who sponsor them. 

&gt; sustain comprehensive economic sanctions until the desired end state is achieved;

What they're talking about is spending trillions of dollars on economic dislocation, and that's not including the cost of unrest that occurs when Africa runs out of wheat. So far, all we've managed to do is *increase* Putin's foreign earnings - our increased energy prices are literally paying the cost of this war for Russia. 

&gt; reduce and eliminate dependence on Russian energy and rebuild energy security; and

In the medium term, this means shifting to an even greater reliance on the Gulf States and especially Saudi Arabia. The problem with that as a Plan B is that there simply is no Plan C. That gives these countries huge leverage over EU and US policy at a very dangerous time. The Saudis have refused to accept Biden's phonecalls. They've said ""they're done with him"". The one thing the GCC wants more than anything from the West is for us to go war with Iran for them. If that's the price for their co-operation, what do we do? 

&gt; conduct a sustained diplomatic effort, leveraging international organizations, to generate and maintain global pressure against Russia.

There is no ""global pressure"" against Russia. China and India think the West is being absolutely foolish and reckless. Without their co-operation, the chance of economically isolating Russia is a very expensive fool's errand. 

--

It's nonsense to conclude that Russia is on some Napoleon plot to conquer Europe. Even if he was, the West is more than capable of stopping him at the borders of Poland, where we can and would use the full conventional force of NATO to hold Russia back. Russia's entire defense budget is $65B/year, which is less than the Pentagon spends on toilet paper. Russia in no way represents a conventional threat to Europe. 

So instead of spending another $1T or 2 on another military adventure that turns into regime change (because after 6 months of inflation and no energy, Europe is going to be *begging* to take Russia out and solve this mess we've gotten ourselves into) - instead of wasting another vast fortune and tens of thousands of more lives, maybe we should try stepping back from the brink for once. 

* No NATO expansion to Eastern Europe. These countries can have adequate security guarantees provided by non-nuclear European states (Poland, Germany, etc). 

* All regions of Ukraine get to vote on their future. 

* We spend the $1T or so we'd have spent on this war (both via weapons and inflation and global disruption) and we instead spend that on renewable energy manufacturing in Ukraine, to help them rebuild. A portion of all Russia's energy earnings go toward this effort.

Everything else? Are you suggesting these companies are boycotting Russia out of some sudden rediscovery of corporate morality and reverence for the UN charter? That's just laughable. On that note, since when has the UN Charter prevented any member of the Security Council from acting in a manner that it deemed to be necessary to secure their interests? 

With regards to apt comparisons, okay...lets not compare the first Iraq War. Lets use the second. Or the coalition air campaign in Syria. Or the countless interventions in Latin America. Or the Vietnam War. We're talking about civilian death tolls that far exceed the highest projected casualties in Ukraine by a factor of hundreds. Where was corporate morality then? Or were *those* civilians simply not important enough to take a share price hit over? 

Your last point is purely emotional and I think, can be safely dismissed as irrelevant. Geopolitics isn't about whether a country is a thief or a murderer. All countries, big and small, attempt to do what they deem necessary to secure their interests. Sometimes they get it, sometimes they don't. Bigger countries get away with it more often than not. Even when they don't get away with it, the rest of the players manage to forget and forgive a lot quicker when bigger countries are involved. I do recall Russia being called out as an international pariah back in 2008...and in 2014...and right now.

The numbers of heavy equipment we are sending are simply insufficient to maintain parity with the Russian forces arrayed against them in the Donbass and the amount that actually reach the front are surely a far cry from the amount we have allocated for them. While this is cheaper than fighting the Russian's ourselves, its certainly not free and that's not taking into account the food crisis that both the invasion and the sanctions on Russia have caused, or the energy crisis that is only going to get worse (and lets not forget what happened last time a food crisis hit the Middle East. Another Arab Spring would not just mess with the current situation a little, it would send it into utter chaos).

As for Russia and their T-62's...until we see current imagery of them off the rails and on the front lines, its safer to assume they are simply being moved around (old hardware gets moved around all the time, when space is needed, for cleaning or treatment, for shipment) or being utilized by reserve units on garrison duty in the territories currently under Russian occupation. A T-62 can hold a bridge or sit at a checkpoint just as effectively as a T-72, which frees up the newer vehicles for frontline service. Keep in mind, the Russian's have occupied roughly 1/5 of Ukraine. That's a lot of territory to defend from partisans and protect against counter offensives. 

With the amount of misinformation pouring out of both sides, the only thing we can do is look at maps and assess the real measurable results. Everything else, from alleged casualties, to rumoured offensives and counter-offensives, to the goals of the Russians or even the morale of the soldiers on either side, is something we are unlikely to be fully clued in on until after this war has reached its conclusion. I think it speaks for itself that some experts say it could last years, others think the Russian military is long overdue to collapse , and others still view a coup in Ukraine in the coming weeks to be inevitable. We simply do not know enough to say whether this course of action is even viable, let alone worth risking escalation over. We do however, know that escalation is very likely and the consequences will be dire for all sides involved and it seems a bit naive to place our hopes in the notion that the Russian's will act exactly as we expect them to should our aid to Ukraine actually cause a situation where the Russian's cannot win conventionally.",10167ecafb9009afc0e6067e0899fd706a856122,True,False,,,,,0,1654524945,,0,{},ibda8cn,False,t3_v61j7c,False,True,t1_ibcx8i7,/r/geopolitics/comments/v61j7c/climbing_the_ladder_how_the_west_can_manage/ibda8cn/,1654524958,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1654496145.0

All of this at the relatively cheap material cost of supplying and training the UAF. Furthermore the public/political willpower to support Ukraine is present in pretty much all member states, unlike the conflict in Afghanistan so if it does come to a protracted war the chances are high of this material support continuing, and NATO's combined military industrial complexes and economic strength will certainly outlast Putin's.

The Confederacy, for example, sought British and French support during the Civil War. As did the Native American confederation that sided with the British during the War of 1812. In all of these cases, what happened was that the Union / US federal government effectively managed the war on both fronts. The Civil War was won by the Union; the War of 1812 was mostly a draw, or even a defeat, for Americans - but effective diplomacy prevented any lasting damage, since the British were themselves weary from fighting Napoleon.

The fact of the matter is that cross-Atlantic / cross-Pacific support is difficult. Especially if you don't control the ocean. The British did during the War of 1812 and the American Civil War, but logistics were poor enough that they were not really able to supply their local allies with the keys to victory. A similar problem faces the Russians and the Chinese. Threatening a military response is only credible if you can deliver on it.

Now, of course, if the Russians and the Chinese controlled the seas, then it'd be a different story and we may see more practical threats and attempts at instigating American separatism.
