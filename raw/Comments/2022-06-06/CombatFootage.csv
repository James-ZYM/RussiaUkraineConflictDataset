UN document outlining Turkey committing ethnic cleansing. Not to mention that they ship their jihadist TFSA to Libya and Azerbaijan too.

 &gt;   throughout the Afrin region, multiple accounts indicate that the property of Kurdish owners was looted and appropriated by Syrian National Army members in a coordinated manner. For example, in September 2019, civilians in the Shaykh al-Hadid subdistrict (of the Afrin region) described how members of Division 14, Brigade 142 (the Suleiman Shah Brigade) of the Syrian National Army had gone from door to door instructing Kurdish families with fewer than three members to vacate their houses to accommodate individuals arriving from outside of Afrin


&gt;    After civilian property was looted, Syrian National Army fighters and their families occupied houses after civilians had fled, or ultimately coerced residents, primarily of Kurdish origin, to flee their homes, through threats, extortion, murder, abduction, torture and detention.

 &gt;   Also in Afrin, in December 2019, a senior member of another Syrian National Army brigade went from door to door in a large residential building, requesting proof of ownership only from the Kurdish inhabitants. One resident, unable to provide such documentation, was forced to appear at the brigade’s security office, where he was verbally abused and told “if it were up to me, I would kill every Kurd from 1 to 80 years old”.

 &gt;   Similarly to in Afrin, the civilian properties of Kurdish owners in the Ra’s al-Ayn region who had fled battles during Operation Peace Spring in October 2019 were also appropriated by Syrian National Army forces. Members of Division 22 (the Hamza Brigade) of the Syrian National Army engaged in widespread and organized looting and property appropriation in Ra’s al-Ayn, including by marking house walls with the names of individual brigades.

Torture by Turkish officials

  &gt;  In detention, civilians – primarily of Kurdish origin – were beaten, tortured, denied food or water, and interrogated about their faith and ethnicity. One boy described to the Commission how he had been detained by the Syrian National Army Military Police in the city of Afrin in mid-2019, and held for five months in the Syrian National Army headquarters, before being transferred to the Afrin central prison and released in March 2020. While detained, both Syrian National Army members and Turkish-speaking officials dressed in military fatigues were present. The boy was handcuffed and hung from a ceiling. He was then blindfolded and repeatedly beaten with plastic tubes. The boy described how the officers interrogated him about his alleged links to the self-administration. In another case, two women were detained by the Syrian National Army in November 2019, at a checkpoint operated jointly with Turkish officials in the Ra’s al-Ayn region, when returning to their homes. One of the victims described how, during interrogation, she had been threatened with rape and beaten on the head by Syrian National Army members, in the presence of Turkish officials. The Commission also received information on joint arrest operations launched by the Syrian National Army Military Police and Turkish police forces in Afrin, including criminal forensic units.

Use of rape

 &gt;   During the period under review, cases of sexual violence against women and men at one detention facility in Afrin were documented. On two occasions, in an apparent effort to humiliate, extract confessions and instil fear within male detainees, Syrian National Army Military Police officers forced male detainees to witness the rape of a minor. On the first day, the minor was threatened with being raped in front of the men, but the rape did not proceed. The following day, the same minor was gang-raped, as the male detainees were beaten and forced to watch in an act that amounts to torture.57 One eyewitness recalled that Turkish officials had been present in the facility on the first day, when the rape was aborted, suggesting their presence may have acted as a deterrent. Another detainee was gang-raped in the same facility some weeks after this incident.",7ed6b4f303f8b21215501b97c6a5e013b274bba5,True,False,,,,,0,1654559361,,0,{},ibff48l,False,t3_v6a4o0,False,True,t1_ibf4u4a,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v6a4o0/turkish_commandos_destroys_pkk_caves_resulting/ibff48l/,1654559372,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654530561.0,

Because the T-72 is still the workhorse of the Russian force making up the bulk of their forces. But around half of those documented in your link are the latest T-72B3 variants upgraded in 2010 and 2016. There's also more T-80s and T-90s on that list than there are T-64s.

But the point wasn't that Russia's equipement is super up-to-date but that it was *more* up-to-date than Ukraine's. The *majority* of Ukrainian tanks in service are T-64 variants and most of the remainder are T-72s just as old as Russia's but fewer have been upgraded as recently.

To understand this mindset you have to understand that they still see the world in what the west would think of as a ""WW2 mindset"". If you are strong you get to say what the borders will be, and that questions about historical borders are perfectly fine to settle with war. So in this worldview the expansion of NATO and the EU represents the ""western empire"" conquering eastern europe rather than individual countries acting in their own self interest. Hence there is nothing especially different about them expanding their own empire, and to do so via war just highlights how strong they are, which is a point of pride. 

Overlaid on this is that many Russians see the loss of Ukraine and Belarus as historically core Russian territories that ""belong"" to Russian. Even at the height of the communist revolution where one of the officially rejected great evils was the Russian empire enslaving non Russian peoples, the Russian communists still had no qualms about invading Ukraine and forcibly aligning them with Russia.

On this subreddit there is plenty of video evidence of Russian troops leaving their wounded or passing them. That doesn't require a long list of videos, that is something anyone who has spent only a few weeks of time here could see for themselves.

&gt; Your messenger has not provided evidence. 

Neither have you, but he has listed a long list of very likely explanation of *why* we see the Russians treating their comrades so poorly.

&gt; Thats not smearing.

Well, the guy I reacted to wrote: ""Oh, and the reason I brought up his bio is it's never a good idea to flag up that you started a Masters program, but didn't finish...best not to mention it at all."". 

When one starts going into someone's education level, they are clearly trying to discredit him and his qualifications. What does his education have to do with how well he analysed the motives for the distrust by the Russian troops in one another?

&gt;  Also Ukrainan army comes from the same Soviet army as Russian army does so hazing would be problem in both. 

Sorry, what?

There is no logical link between an army ""coming from the Soviet Army"" and them considering hazing to be the norm. Or do you now also want to claim that the same level of hazing happens in the three Baltic states as well? After all, they ""came from the Soviet army"" as well as Ukraine! 

Everything we have seen shows that the Ukrainians have a different approach towards camaraderie than the Russians.
Maybe that is because they were trained for a number of years by western military, or maybe it's the ""us vs them""-feeling because they are fighting for their own land against an invader, but it's clear that the Ukrainians have a different fighting spirit and different attitude towards their fellow soldiers than most of the Russians. 

&gt; We dont see a lot of russian troops failing to take care of their wounded. We see some, ***we also see the same for ukranian soldiers***. 

Nowhere near ""the same"": We see a *lot* of Ukrainians helping their own wounded, not so for the Russians.

&gt; There are many videos of russians helping wounded ukrainans. I would say both sides do their best to help their wounded, but sometimes in heat of battle it just happens that you leave them behind. 

I disagree. We see a few videos of Russians taking care of wounded Ukrainians, usually when they know that there is a camera rolling, and especially when there are whole news crews standing and recording. 

That says little to nothing about how much care the Russians give to their own comrades, especially on the battlefield. The videos of Russians walking straight past their wounded comrades paints a very different image. Sure, sometimes there is nothing they can do, but in plenty of situations that we were shown here on r/combatfootage that doesn't seem to be the case.

&gt; There has been so many lies in this war that i dont trust anything that isnt backed by proof. I dont mean to be hostile to you or anything im just tired of all the propaganda. Im not gonna pretend that everything UA side says is true without proof. Im not saying they are lying but no proof = no believing.

Well, I do agree that being critical of the information being fed to us is important, but so far everything we have seen here shows a considerable difference in the way Ukrainians and Russians deal with their wounded comrades, *especially* in battle!",4f6c940f1399b92e065bf48937a1083925774ea6,True,False,,,,,0,1654550476,,0,{},ibewoag,False,t3_v5xl5r,False,True,t1_ibejawv,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v5xl5r/largely_unedited_footage_of_a_russian_quadcopter/ibewoag/,1654550491,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654521676.0,

NATO doctrine is now low intensity warfare. It's built around fighting small, limited, low intensity conflicts. 

Russian doctrine may be trying to transition to this, but they haven't been able to divorce themselves of the kit that was designed for Soviet total war doctrine. Their equipment is designed with the knowledge that tanks are not indestructable, and in peer on peer conflict they are going to be big metal coffins IF they are targetted by atgms/rpgs or air assets.

The 2006 Israeli Hezbollah war showed how this, and this wasn't even a peer on peer engagement. In a matter of a week or two, when the Israelis pushed their Merkava IVs into Lebanon towards the end of the war. They brought 300 tanks. They had 5 tanks destroyed. Another 20-22 knocked out (disabled) out of 50-55 that were hit and damaged but not knocked out. That's a low intensity limited conflict. One of the worlds most highly trained and best equipped fighting forces, fighting an irregular militia. In a couple of weeks, they took what represented nearly 10% of their total fighting force in losses. 22/300. In high intensity conflict, many of those 22 disabled tanks would have been destroyed by their crews when they were abandoned.

The point being, and RPG-29 is going to kill or knock out an Abrams just like an NLAW kills a t-72. It may not kill the Western tank outright, but then the T-90m that made the rounds a couple weeks ago. It turns out it wasn't killed either. It was disabled and the crew demo'd it to prevent it being captured. I'm not saying they (T-90m's) can't be killed, but a tank disabled and then burned by its crew is still a destroyed tank, be it a T-90m or a Challenger, or a Leopard etc.

TLDR. The Russian military is still geared towards high intensity/mass warfare. The west has shifted towards a doctrine that is geared towards lower intensity/limited conflicts, where they have less to fear from the opforce regarding the opforces capabilities in anti-tank and anti-air.",f1f373e2787b1720a8e2d91944b82a03736edf98,True,True,,,,,0,1654548636,,0,{},ibeshmd,False,t3_v61qqf,False,True,t1_ibe7hl2,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v61qqf/russian_spetsnaz_fighting_in_a_forest_in/ibeshmd/,1654548653,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654519836.0,

[Here](https://warontherocks.com/2022/06/not-built-for-purpose-the-russian-militarys-ill-fated-force-design/) is an article about Russian force structure that I found interesting.

&gt; The new motorized rifle platoon has three squads of seven soldiers without a platoon headquarters. Only the platoon commander isn’t part of one of the squads, and the first squad is led by the deputy platoon commander. A seven-man squad would mean that each BMP or BTR vehicle would have four available dismounts not including the crew of three. But many of these squads only have five or six soldiers. In practice, this means that many Russian motorized rifle squads only have enough soldiers to operate their vehicles, but not to dismount and fight on foot. Indeed, there have been cases where Russian BTR and BMPs only had a crew of three, without any dismounts.

That's not right. I see only half the squad ever leave their original positions. 

&gt;They do not do so with their rifles raised, they do not cover one another, they do not advance slowly.

They certainly do cover one another. And they advance in two leaps, in between which they kneel with their rifles raised. Two guys go directly to the wounded guy, but stop before they get there while one guy goes above and another below to get a visual on the other guys. Only then do they advance to the wounded guy. This entire time they are still being covered by the other half of their squad that never moved.

&gt;They just start sprinting to provide first aid, while the guys laying on the ground still have their rifles and are able to return fire.

By the time they are providing aid, their teammate has already gone up to the two dead bodies so there is no danger there. As they advance to the wounded guy, they also have a teammate with his rifle on him ready to blast him away. 

&gt; The behaviour of the troops changes in a split second

Yes. And that could be friendly fire. But it could also be that these are extremely well trained troops who have sprung into phase 2 of the operation after they've unleashed the ambush. IF they are SSO, then they know you have to move quick and force a surrender with violence of action. If they just waited behind their concealed positions, the Ukrainian could have decided to make a last stand thus ruining their op.

Or, would Russia beat the Ukraine you want Germany, Turkey, France or the UK to get to fight against in that hypothetical war? 

As to the US, I think it would greatly depend on the force involved. If the US took a force similar in size to the one Russia did, I have no doubt the US would be doing better, but I'm doubtful conventional combat operations would be complete at this point. Ukraine is a significantly larger, and more difficult foe to deal with than Iraq was. Few key points. Ukraine has a significantly better air defense grid, that is more difficult to locate due to terrain (forest vs desert). Ukraine is nearly 50% larger than Iraq. Ukraine has a highly motivated military, Iraq did not. Outside of a few Iraqi units, most of them were just waiting to surrender.

You don't and you explain your point properly.

It is a know topic in the armed forces. In the 90's everything was cut back: the nuclear force, the fleet, conscription was ended, etc. It was only with Afghanistan that the various limitations were made obvious. But when it take a few years to disarm, it takes consistent effort and spending over a decade or more to rearm. At the moment it is public knowledge that the armed forces have various skills and capabilities more rarely enough depth in all of them to sustain attrition or what we call ""high intensity conflict"". In 2016 already a report from the army (Action Terrestre Futur) pointed out the need for ""masse"" and ""endurance"" to sustain such incoming conflict especially in theatres with strong demography or urban warfare.

In short France has a wide array of skills and a variety of equipment (with some limitations one of the worst one being no more heavy helicopters) but is lacking in numbers and reserve.

The issue being that keeping those skills and increasing strategic depth and reserve would require a defense spending in the area of 4% of GDP (it was 5% in the early 60s for instance).",a8ded3bc0974af4c6ed8471384d7d61ecb1f9f08,True,False,,,,,0,1654545593,,0,{},ibeljae,False,t3_v5r33z,False,True,t1_ibd8wl1,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v5r33z/a_day_with_the_ukrainian_artillerymen_using_the/ibeljae/,1654545606,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654516793.0,

&gt;  
&gt;Learn to google, little lady. God knows you have enough time on your dainty little hands ;).  
&gt;  
&gt;The trail of tears was evil, and I've already said that U.S. policy to natives was reprehensible. But, do you know what is actually worse? What China is doing today, in the 21st century, and what Hitler did during WW2, what Japan did to your people during WW2, and I can go on and on.  
&gt;  
&gt;Again, this comment wasn't about imperialism, but about nation building in faraway distant lands. The nuances required to deal with cultural and linguistic barriers, being able to stick with it for the long-term, dealing with the initial monetary drain. The U.S. has no real experience with it, and it was always going to struggle once it quickly accomplished its military goals. Most of Europe and most of Asia possess that historical blueprint. Their populations are aware of the way these things go. The U.S. doesn't.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's amusing to me how hard you're trying to turn a conversation around tactical battles to a broader conversation that is now venturing into societal ills. You've left all pretenses of trying to make this about geopolitics, even though that wasn't even the genesis of this conversation, to an indictment on the U.S. criminal system? Lol. And, just to play along, I think the U.S. attitude towards recidivism is fundamentally flawed and broken. I believe that its, again, morally reprehensible and inhumane for a society to essentially incarcerate 0.5% of its population at any given time. But, yet again, the way China deals with its criminals is worse. And just because you jail fewer people doesn't mean a whole lot when you consider broader individual liberties and freedom. Incarceration is not the only metric you can go by.  
&gt;  
&gt;I didn't bring up imperialism for ""some reason"". Further, you can look at the meta research on this topic. The vast majority of scholars, do not view the U.S. as an imperialistic power.  
&gt;  
&gt;That's literally not what I said. I gave you a recent example of when the U.S. was asked to leave a country with its base, and it did. Soft power/hard power, it didn't matter. They were asked to leave, they left. You are trying to lump things in to fit your presupposed and prejudiced viewpoint. Words have meanings. When those meanings don't conform to your incredibly narrow worldview, it doesn't mean you suddenly get to change what those words mean. Secondly, if you disagree with a premise, at least definitionally, you should offer something of substance that the other person can respond to.  
&gt;  
&gt;Wrong. The vast majority of U.S. bases are in developed countries, and if you go purely by troop count, a very small fraction are in developing countries. And, I'm not even going into the reality around how much the U.S. and American taxpayers spend on defense so other countries don't have to on their militaries.  
&gt;  
&gt;Here's the difference between the West and China, on a fundamental level. We have the right to and utilize this right to, criticize our government, leaders and policies. In this comment, and throughout my comment history, I readily admit to the failures of the U.S., where its fallen morally short, where its not done right by its founding principals and where it needs to learn from other countries (including China) and do better. Show me where you can be self-critical and self-reflective. Instead of pivoting and deflecting and countering any and every critique of your nation show me that you have any ability to question things.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Chinese have done an incredible job. Their leadership over the past 30 years has been ruthless, but fundamentally the most effective leadership in the world. Too bad it has to deal with citizenry like you, though ;). Leave the West and go back home.

Would highly recommend checking them out. Russia has wasted most of its high tech guided ordinance on nonspecific civilian targets. Ukraines strategy in severodonetsk has been to hug as close as possible to Russian lines so they can’t use their artillery or superior air power due to the large area of effect for risk of friendly fire, while Ukraine has access to highly precise NATO artillery that can be used in this capacity. There is a not so insignificant amount of high tech equipment being used by Ukraine to great effect, compared Russia seemingly wasting their equipment away. 

There’s also to consider, Russia isn’t technically at war. The units they have allocated are peacetime military, and much of their equipment is not their top of the line due to this. Just exactly how much is due to them running out, or simply not allocating what they have, we cannot possibly know. But considering how many people they are losing every day and not accomplishing a single objective to great embarrassment, it’s not logical to conclude that they aren’t trying everything they can to accomplish something other than waste equipment and lives.

So to actually answer the question, using the the M777, each round will be off in range about 0.3% of the total distance fired and off in deflection(left or right of impact) 1m/per Km. This will make a sort of circle called a MPI(mean point of impact) with those dimensions.

And, again, your broad-based approach to international relations would get you a F at any reputable university. You lack any measure of nuance, subtility and understanding of historical context. 

&gt; Can you show me a figure for how many Uyghurs China has killed?

Learn to google, little lady. God knows you have enough time on your dainty little hands ;). 

&gt; Holy shit you're evil. How do you make the trail of tears look humanistic?

The trail of tears *was* evil, and I've already said that U.S. policy to natives was reprehensible. But, do you know what *is* actually worse? What China is doing today, in the 21st century, and what Hitler did during WW2, what Japan did to your people during WW2, and I can go on and on. 

&gt; Yes, because that's not how imperialism works in the 20th and 21st centuries. That's like saying there isn't labor exploitation because there aren't child sweatshops.

Again, this comment wasn't about imperialism, but about nation building in faraway distant lands. The nuances required to deal with cultural and linguistic barriers, being able to stick with it for the long-term, dealing with the initial monetary drain. The U.S. has no real experience with it, and it was always going to struggle once it quickly accomplished its military goals. Most of Europe and most of Asia possess that historical blueprint. Their populations are aware of the way these things go. The U.S. doesn't. 

&gt; America has imprisoned more people (people that tend to be of certain racial and socioeconomic statuses) than China has, despite China having 4x the people.

It's amusing to me how hard you're trying to turn a conversation around tactical battles to a broader conversation that is now venturing into societal ills. You've left all pretenses of trying to make this about geopolitics, even though that wasn't even the genesis of this conversation, to an indictment on the U.S. criminal system? Lol. And, just to play along, I think the U.S. attitude towards recidivism is fundamentally flawed and broken. I believe that its, again, morally reprehensible and inhumane for a society to essentially incarcerate 0.5% of its population at any given time. But, yet again, the way China deals with its criminals is worse. And just because you jail fewer people doesn't mean a whole lot when you consider broader individual liberties and freedom. Incarceration is not the only metric you can go by. 

&gt; You brought up imperialism for some reason so you thought it was at least of baseline relevance, and I just quickly responded because what you said was kinda dumb

I didn't bring up imperialism for ""some reason"". Further, you can look at the meta research on this topic. The **vast** majority of scholars, do not view the U.S. as an imperialistic power. 

&gt; Ahh imperialism is going to war huh. Big brain you got here

That's literally not what I said. I gave you a recent example of when the U.S. was asked to leave a country with its base, and it did. Soft power/hard power, it didn't matter. They were asked to leave, they left. You are trying to lump things in to fit your presupposed and prejudiced viewpoint. Words have meanings. When those meanings don't conform to your incredibly narrow worldview, it doesn't mean you suddenly get to change what those words mean. Secondly, if you disagree with a premise, at least definitionally, you should offer something of substance that the other person can respond to. 

&gt; because it has rolled over smaller countries and constructed military bases there

Wrong. Vast majority of U.S. bases are in developed countries, and if you go purely by troop count, a *very* small fraction are in developing countries. And, I'm not even going into the reality around how much the U.S. and American taxpayers spend on defense so other countries don't have to on their militaries. 

&gt; They have the highest GDP PPP in the world, and it's only getting higher. America's is literally declining this year

Here's the difference between the West and China, on a fundamental level. We have the right to, and utilize the right to, criticize our government, leaders and policies. In this comment, and throughout my comment history, I readily admit to the failures of the U.S., where its fallen morally short, where its not done right by its ideals and where it needs to learn from other countries (including China) and do better. Show me where you can be self-critical and self-reflective. Instead of pivoting and deflecting and countering any and every critique of your nation show me that you have any ability to question things. 

&gt; Also raised 800,000,000 people above the international poverty line in 40 years. Kinda crazy

The Chinese have done an incredible job. Their leadership over the past 30 years has been ruthless, but fundamentally the most effective leadership in the world. Too bad it has to deal with citizenry like you, though ;). Leave the West and go back home.

Two reasons as my limited understanding has it (They're the experts I've just been listening to their podcasts). 

First, because they've suffered truly horrific attrition because of a shitty strategy, logistical problems and that same lake of infantry. Even the most modern high-tech tank going into urban and forested terrain without infantry support is a really bad idea.  Second, while it is happening it's probably not happening to quite as great a degree you might think if you're only paying attention to the rah-rah cheerleading on reddit. Every single time an outdated piece of soviet era kit is seen on TikTok we know about it... meanwhile we're contradictorily cheering when the latest and greatest Russian wunderwaffe weapons shows up destroyed on the battlefield. We're also ignoring that in at least some cases the kit Ukraine started out with is the same outdated soviet era kit that some Russian units are now *reduced* to. 

It's true that western equipment is being shipped and starting to trickle out onto the battlefield. The longer the war goes on the more Ukraine will have an advantage in both manpower *and* in  equipment. 

Now, they could be wrong. I was just listening to a couple of seemingly well respected expert analysts talking about what they were seeing in the war and I was just struck by how it contradicted the popular narrative I hear on forums like this.",4174a61464c58b216345c5bb888f7bd348f85526,True,False,,,,,0,1654541766,,0,{},ibeco9t,False,t3_v5yj4i,False,True,t1_ibe77m1,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v5yj4i/video_of_azovs_sso_in_a_firefight_and_storming_a/ibeco9t/,1654541780,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654512966.0,

[Answering The Call: Heavy Weaponry Supplied To Ukraine || Oryx || 2022](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/04/answering-call-heavy-weaponry-supplied.html)

The assumption is that Ukraine is continuing to defend where reasonable and make Russia use up it's already lacking infantry and then counter attack with Ukrainian units that have been training on the newest equipment.  

This is costly for Ukraine but also costly for Russia.  Ukrainian is betting that Russia will not be able to keep grinding at this tempo but Ukraine will with western supplies/assistance.

The summary of the 102nd day of Russian invasion to Ukraine, as of 22:00 – 5th June 2022 (Kyiv time).

Kharkiv Frontline: There was no change on the ground in Kharkiv Oblast.

Siverskyi Donets: The enemy intensifies attacks on the left bank of Siversky Donets towards Svyatohirsk and Stary Karavan, trying to push Ukrainian forces to the right bank. Russian sources claim that Ukrainian troops retreated from Shchurove.  Based on the available footage, it’s safe to assume Russian forces captured Yarova near Svyatohirsk.  Ukrainian forces conducting counter-offensive operations in the city of Sievierodonetsk. The enemy concentrates its main force in the eastern district.

South-Eastern Front: Russian army has reportedly changed its tactic and focuses on targeting units in the rear, trying to disrupt Ukrainian supply lines.

Kherson Frontline: Ukrainian General Staff reported fighting in the vicinity of Sukhyi Stavok and Lozove. Russian troops reportedly attempted to recapture previously lost positions, but the attack was repelled.",146862c434c77a4e48505e26a93154cea89bb385,True,True,,,,,0,1654540352,,0,{},ibe9f1b,False,t3_v5d4n0,False,True,t1_ibdxsrx,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v5d4n0/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_6622/ibe9f1b/,1654540368,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654511552.0,

1991, still around 80% of the strikes were unguided. Today US has a far longer range and more/better guided munition.

&gt;As those also work only against old and shitty SAMs

Maybe we can talk about jamming against modern SAM systems being ineffective, but notching? Russians are able to bend the laws of physics?

&gt;So if they are outside anti air range. What kind of dark magic that they are inside airforce range?

An ideal range of S400 - &lt;400km (real will be lower)

A standard range of the MALD - &gt;900km

Range of the cruise missile - 1k+km

SLAM-ER - 270km

&gt;What kind of dark magic 

Different types of propulsion and the fact, that SAM system won't maneuver.

&gt;So your whole idea is that airforce in a limited weight and space has better capabilities and equipment than something on land without any of such limitations? Like it is impossible to launch anti air earlier, from further away and as accurately.

I have no idea what are you trying to say here. Please, try to explain your sentence.

&gt;And if that is not enough, there is even more anti air than what you have listed? In a decent war with near peers there is no way more fighters would be allowed to exist than anti air vehicles and systems are capable of dealing with as they are just cheaper.

You do not need a lot of airplanes to create a lot of targets. I have already explained to you how.

&gt;You can ignore large part of them, as many do not pose risk to anti air equipment as not all of it will be spotted and locked into. Shooting plane down is a priority as it can just load new missiles.

You don't know, which target is a threat and which isn´t. You have to shoot down all. MALD is designed to look like any missile/plane on the radar thanks to its signature.

&gt;Shooting plane down is a priority as it can just load new missiles.

The plane will be at a safe distance when it launches.

&gt;Or it is hidden in some underground parking, factory and when number is decent enough you won't locate and destroy them as easily as in the barrn dessert.

You can not hide your air defense underground.

Ukrainian anti air is basically a rag tag mix of a bunch of different soviet stuff, how much of which has been maintained is unknown. They rely heavily on mostly long range and short range systems, they have S-300s, not many of which were actually active prior to the war. Otherwise they rely mostly on MANPADS, which aren't super effective against modern multiroles/fighters.

&gt;Ukraine has modern ATGMs

True enough, though I'm sure they're pressing older systems in service as well.


&gt;relatively capable tanks(T-64BV

Ehhhhhhhh idk. They have around a 100 or so BMs, which are supposedly decent and at least have modern ERA and fire control, another 100 or so 2017 model BVs which have better FCS and thermal imager. But the issue mainly is going to be how old they already are, sure they've under gone modernization, but they're very old vehicles that are inherently less reliable and more difficult to maintain, especially all of the non-modernized T-64s. They also don't seem to have received new internal armor, the BMs have new ERA, but underneath its still a T-64B and is going to be vulnerable to modern anti tank systems and especially to other tanks. 

Another big issue is ammunition, afaik Ukraine hasn't been developing/producing new ammunition (other than gun fired ATGMs) for their 2A46s. They're probably still rolling older soviet stock and producing those same rounds to spec because they don't have the capability to develop more modern penetrators. A tank is a tank and is valuable for fire support, but going up against modern MBTs in a T-64, modernized or not, isn't something I would enjoy.",6dfd29ce50fcd37bdc1fa29c9c99cc132ca4023e,True,False,,,,,0,1654538977,,0,{},ibe67m3,False,t3_v61qqf,False,False,t1_ibdkpt1,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v61qqf/russian_spetsnaz_fighting_in_a_forest_in/ibe67m3/,1654538993,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654510177.0,

Kinda yeah lmao

&gt;As shameful as the U.S. history with Native tribes was/is, China is taking it to an entirely new level with the genocide of the Uyghurs and that's happening in 2022.

Can you show me a figure for how many Uyghurs China has killed?

America has imprisoned more people (people that tend to be of certain racial and socioeconomic statuses) than China has, despite China having *4x* the people. 

&gt;makes the U.S. treatment of its native population, look like downright humanistic. 

Holy shit you're evil. How do you make the trail of tears look humanistic?

&gt;Yet, no serious person calls Australia an imperial power.

Yes, they do? Australia is a partner to the imperialist West?

&gt;the U.S. doesn't have a lot of experience with non-contiguous expansion and never truly pursued it with vigor and as a matter of policy. Unlike monarchial powers like Great Britian, or the Ottoman's, there was no Empire building going on.

Yes, because that's not how imperialism works in the 20th and 21st centuries. That's like saying there isn't labor exploitation because there aren't child sweatshops. 

&gt;his wasn't a conversation around the international relations definitions of imperialism, but one around nation building specific to Iraq and Afghanistan. 

You brought up imperialism for some reason so you thought it was at least of baseline relevance, and I just quickly responded because what you said was kinda dumb

&gt;Any and all of those countries are welcome to boot the U.S. out. When they were asked to leave Subic Bay, guess what? They left. Does the U.S. apply soft power? Of course it fucking does. But it's not going to war for any of those bases.

Nobody is expecting them to go to war over bases, also lmao that's the point. The US uses it's ""soft"" power to create a global front of military influence. The US is implicated by regional conflicts because it has bases in those countries, despite its contiguous territory being literally halfway around the world. But this gives it license to intervene militarily somehow, in a conflict that has nothing to do with it, because it has rolled over smaller countries and constructed military bases there.

&gt; That's definitionally the opposite of imperialism. 

Ahh imperialism is going to war huh. Big brain you got here

&gt;As to China...lol. What do you think the Belt and Road initiative is? 

Where are China's military bases? I see them constructing docks, roads, airports, infrastructure, ya know, the things developing countries need...idk maybe you disagree

&gt;And no shit they don't have bases in Mexico and Canada. China has come a long way in a short period of time, but you were a literal shithouse country 50 years ago. I have deep admiration for the Chinese people and what they have been able to accomplish, but let's not try to polish a turd too hard.

Where did this come from? I literally just used China as a toss-in example where I had half the mind to use Russia. This just looks obsessive lmao

They have the highest GDP PPP in the world, and it's only getting higher. America's is literally declining this year

Also raised 800,000,000 people above the international poverty line in 40 years. Kinda crazy

And yet we point at ISIS making compilations of Syrian soldiers getting shot with traditional arab music over it and we scream ""what soulless monsters,"" but to the people those videos are meant for; its propaganda, same as this.

And that works only if air defense is way inferior, like shit lever and can't shoot down those who try to supress it.

&gt;Yes and no. They had a quite potent anti-air defense. 450+ long range SAMs. They were worse than modern SAMs but so was US air force worse than it is today.

45km and from mid 50s? That was bad by 90s standarts. Number is let's say usable in a local conflict,  but not against US. Distance and technology, was way too ancient and definitely not something US had to worry about too much at least not to the level of fully sabotaging the invasion.

For better systems from 70s 15-25km wasn't really enough against US.

&gt;You have literally ignored all the other ways of defending against SAM system.

As those also work only against old and shitty SAMs.

&gt;F16 can carry at least four malds and B52 can carry more than 20. If you deploy just 10 B52 bombers you can have more than 200 air targets flying towards IADS from outside of their radar range.

So if they are outside anti air range. What kind of dark magic that they are inside airforce range?

&gt;Implement some anti-radiation missiles from a few f15/16/18/35 multirole fighters and some 100 cruise missiles (one Arleigh Burke-class destroyer can carry up to 96 of them) and you should be able to overwhelm IADS. If it won't be enough, you can send in a few AH64s and destroy anything left standing, because it will be already spent.

So your whole idea is that airforce in a limited weight and space has better capabilities and equipment than something on land without any of such limitations? Like it is impossible to launch anti air earlier, from further away and as accurately. 

&gt;If it won't be enough, you can send in a few AH64s and destroy anything left standing, because it will be already spent.

And if that is not enough, there is even more anti air than what you have listed? In a decent war with near peers there is no way more fighters would be allowed to exist than anti air vehicles and systems are capable of dealing with as they are just cheaper.

&gt;You can not shoot at the planes when you have to shoot at the missiles and decoys coming your way. Not to mention MALDs and Cruise missiles outrange any SAM system.

You can ignore large part of them, as many do not pose risk to anti air equipment as not all of it will be spotted and locked into. Shooting plane down is a priority as it can just load new missiles. 

&gt;Because Russia is not nearly as capable of SEAD as US air force.

Or it is hidden in some underground parking, factory and when number is decent enough you won't locate and destroy them as easily as in the barrn dessert.",5dd7f5ea8765c4fedf7d5baacf93107a296aa126,True,False,,,,,0,1654536337,,0,{},ibe01tv,False,t3_v61qqf,False,True,t1_ibdy31j,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v61qqf/russian_spetsnaz_fighting_in_a_forest_in/ibe01tv/,1654536348,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654507537.0,

Did I now? No, I didn't. I listed a couple of reasons why Russian soldiers seem to react in a less than comrade kind of way to their comrades. I also posted a link to an analysis that gives very convincing arguments why we have seen so much footage of Russian troops not taking care of their wounded comrades.

&gt; You dont have evidence that Russians are not taking care of their wounded.

Please be so kind and point out ***exactly*** where I claimed that ""Russians are not taking care of their wounded"".

&gt; If i post some pro-Russian guy talking all kinds of wild claims without proof would you accept that as facts? Or would you just dismiss it based on the messenger? 

What exactly does that have to do with the validity of the arguments brought by that Bulgarian? It doesn't! You're merely trying to smear the messenger because you have failed to give a single valid argument to counter the long list of reasons (hazing, theft, protection rackets, etc.) for the distrust between so many of the Russian troops. I have also not heard a single counter argument against the deep rooted corruption within the military influencing that distrust.

&gt; You should also realize that Russia is not waging a total war. They have not taken out electricity, they are still pumping gas thru the Ukrainan pipeline and so on. They are of course not doing this out of goodness of their heart but because they want to control those territories so they dont want the people to hate them too much.

And what does *any* of that have to do with the issue at hand: namely that we see a lot of Russian troops failing to take care of their own wounded, compared to many examples of the Ukrainians looking after their wounded comrades.",1b45676fcdd36ba06d40c34bf13e773192361ef7,True,False,,,,,0,1654536217,,0,{},ibdzrqc,False,t3_v5xl5r,False,True,t1_ibdwvew,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v5xl5r/largely_unedited_footage_of_a_russian_quadcopter/ibdzrqc/,1654536232,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654507417.0,

Napalm munitions disperse a sticky, flaming liquid over a wide area. By contrast, a fuel-air explosive detonates the very air itself: a small explosive inside the FAE munition spreads a chemical cloud in the air through an aerosol effect. The gaseous cloud seeps effortlessly into buildings and caves, and down into slit trenches. A secondary explosive then ignites the cloud, causing a massive and long-lasting explosion.

&gt;While the heat generated by FAEs causes lethal burns in a wide radius (roughly two hundred by three hundred meters) the overpressure created by the sudden combustion of the air is even deadlier. The fiery blasts create a partial oxygen vacuum that kills and maims in a variety of grotesque ways and cannot be mitigated with body armor or hard cover.

&gt; The pressure generated by a TOS-1 blast amounts to 427 pounds per square-inch—for comparison, most conventional bomb blasts create roughly half that amount, and regular air pressure is fourteen pounds per square inch. Victims near the center of a TOS-1 blast radius are crushed to death. Further out, the overpressure can break bones, dislocate eyes, cause internal hemorrhaging, and rupture eardrums, bowels and other internal organs. It also sucks the air out of victims’ lungs, possibly causing them to collapse, leading to death by suffocation.

There's not much to be learned here except that a massive, rich country with a modern military can pummel a small, impoverished country with an outdated military.

&gt; Ehhh, the SAM bubble was effective, but that was equally because Israel's plan to take it out got shelved because of problems on the Syrian front. The Sagger missiles and the primitive night vision in Soviet tanks were effective and advanced for their time.

Oh, so Soviet gear was actually effective and didn't fail miserably in every engagement with NATO-equipped troops. Who knew?

&gt; How did the war end again for those troops who crossed the Suez canal?

It went well for them as long as they were under their Soviet-built SAM bubble. It went badly for them when they left their SAM bubble and overextended themselves by attacking deeper into the Sinai. Then the superior Israeli air force came into play, and with the help of American intelligence, the Israelis were able to exploit a weak point in the Egyptian line and break through. If the Egyptians had held to their original plan and not overextended, they might have ended up in a better position.

As I said, this was a close-run thing, in which both sides scored impressive tactical victories.

Yes, that is correct. That is why you first fly sorties to destroy or suppress enemy air defense.

&gt;In Iraq longest range anti air missile they had was from 1950s with max 45km range. That was ancient and really not impressed.

Yes and no. They had a quite potent anti-air defense. 450+ long range SAMs. They were worse than modern SAMs but so was US air force worse than it is today.

&gt;Fly lower ant that is where more modern MANPADS have an effect

You have literally ignored all the other ways of defending against SAM system.

&gt;And that pretty much works only when it is insufficient to counter airforce at the first place. If it was good anti air it would have an advantage due to higher power radars, more powerful missiles with more fuel for longer distances.

MALDS, HARMS and Cruise missiles are cheaper than missiles used by S400, especially for countries with the production capability of the US. 

F16 can carry at least four malds and B52 can carry more than 20. If you deploy just 10 B52 bombers you can have more than 200 air targets flying towards IADS from outside of their radar range. Implement some anti-radiation missiles from a few f15/16/18/35 multirole fighters and some 100 cruise missiles (one Arleigh Burke-class destroyer can carry up to 96 of them) and you should be able to overwhelm IADS. If it won't be enough, you can send in a few AH64s and destroy anything left standing, because it will be already spent.

&gt;If they deplete surface missiles them air ones would be even more depleted due to smaller capacity on planes.

You can rotate squadrons attacking the site, the US has a lot of planes and ships. But as I have mentioned above, you do not need a lot of airplanes, if you know what to do. 

&gt;You also give away your location and it seems like you imply you can't shoot back at those planes with decent systems.

You can not shoot at the planes when you have to shoot at the missiles and decoys coming your way. Not to mention MALDs and Cruise missiles outrange any SAM system.

&gt;Even old s300 doesn't allow Russians to freely fly above Ukraine and they launch around a dozen of cruise missiles daily.

Because Russia is not nearly as capable of SEAD as US air force.",cc6472095435008c37730c82dc62aee3c977a1e6,True,False,,,,,0,1654535495,,0,{},ibdy31j,False,t3_v61qqf,False,True,t1_ibdtbp9,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v61qqf/russian_spetsnaz_fighting_in_a_forest_in/ibdy31j/,1654535511,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654506695.0,

(no, they were a part of the Persian Empire BEFORE the war), that ""Persia enjoys uncontested dominance of the Med for 100 years"" (they did not, they were banished from the Ægean). 
These are unsubstantiated claims pulled from your ass, and are contrary not only to scholarly consensus but also common sense. 

As regards the consequence of the peace, the Britannica writes:
&gt; In exchange for peace, Artaxerxes I of Persia recognized the liberty of the Greek states in Europe and Asia and vowed to keep the Persian fleet out of the Aegean.

That is Greece as a whole, independent from Persia. 

Diodorus Siculus, the main source on the Peace of Callias, writes that the Persian satraps, responsible for taxation, were barred from Ionia. 
Herodotus notes simply that the Persians were expelled from Ionia. 

The Cambridge Ancient History vol. 4 notes:

&gt;

&gt;Victory was complete. The remaining task was to record it for posterity,
in battlefield trophies and tombstones, in the dedication of spoils both in
the home towns of the participants and at the great panhellenic
sanctuaries, and in the foundation of memorial festivals whose annual
celebrations would stir the hearts of generations unborn...which he was joined by Ionians and Hellespontine Greeks in the flush of
enthusiasm to spread to others the liberty they had just taken for
themselves from Xerxes...


Aeschylus writes:

&gt; 
Ch. Yes, for all Greece would have become subject to the King ...
&gt;
At. What shepherd is in charge, lord of their host?
&gt;
Ch. They are not called the slaves or subjects of any man.

2782,[],False,,LTagrastas,,,[],,,,text,t2_hhmj7cz4,False,False,"&gt;Anti air defense is not as simple as you may think. S300 series can have an impressive range on paper (300-400km) with some missiles, but in reality, there are a lot of factors to consider. In reality, you can get something like 50-100km with the longest range systems. Still, an impressive number but that can be further diminished.

At least that makes US planes vulnerable. You start to weight options that you might loose significant number of planes. In Iraq longest range anti air missile they had was from 1950s with max 45km range. That was ancient and really not impressed. Decent systems from 70s had only 25km range.

&gt;You can use electronic warfare and try to jam the radars, you can fly lower, use stealth or you can notch the radar.

Fly lower ant that is where more modern MANPADS have an effect.

&gt;SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defense) and DEAD (Destruction of Enemy Air Defense) are tactics that aim to deny any action of SAM systems of the enemy. 

And that pretty much works only when it is insufficient to counter airforce at the first place. If it was good anti air it would have an advantage due to higher power radars, more powerful missiles with more fuel for longer distances.


 

&gt;For example, the S300 system can track around 6 targets at once, depending on the variant. You can use multiple aircrafts to launch HARM antiradiation missiles combined with air launched decoys MALD and cruise missiles to overwhelm air defense. Suddenly air defense sites have to deal with hundreds of air targets. It can do nothing else than to try and destroy all incoming targets. Some will get through and destroy systems, others will just deplete missiles of the system and they cannot be replenished immediately.

And then you likely spend way more resources and money for that one system then it even costs.

If they deplete surface missiles them air ones would be even more depleted due to smaller capacity on planes.

You also give away your location and it seems like you imply you can't shoot back at those planes with decent systems.

Even old s300 doesn't allow Russians to freely fly above Ukraine and they launch around a dozen of cruise missiles daily.",61d21eb848a86a55c02c7aaff7f3a5e25b235291,True,False,,,,,0,1654533476,,0,{},ibdtbp9,False,t3_v61qqf,False,True,t1_ibdrdxo,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v61qqf/russian_spetsnaz_fighting_in_a_forest_in/ibdtbp9/,1654533490,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654504676.0,

I've been listening to the War on the Rocks podcast done by professional military analysts and they think this is very much the case. The popular narrative is that the Ukrainians are better trained and better equipped but the Russians outnumber them. 

Their take is that in the big picture the exact opposite is actually true. Overall the Russians have a lot more, and generally *better*, equipment particularly when it comes to the big stuff that packs a punch. BUT, they are outnumbered by the Ukrainians in the field because they're attempting to fight a major war with only their peacetime military which is NOT designed to fight a real war at all without a general mobilization. It's a massively over-equipped but massively undermanned placeholder that newly called up conscripts are supposed to attach to and fill out with manpower in the event of a war... Without the call-up that their whole force structure is predicated upon they're fucked up.. they have a ton of artillery, tanks, and infantry fighting vehicles driving around (almost) empty except for the crew because there's no infantry to sit in the back to support the heavy equipment.",c604f6ddd8b8820e1817c5a905e63293eca645e3,True,False,,,,,0,1654533014,,0,{},ibds8v8,False,t3_v5yj4i,False,True,t1_ibcspgv,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v5yj4i/video_of_azovs_sso_in_a_firefight_and_storming_a/ibds8v8/,1654533026,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654504214.0,

Because that's how any of this works....

The volunteers are long since spent. There are boys being rounded up in Chechnya and other rural regions and ***forced*** into going to war.

Look... I'm all for exposing what a fuck-wit Putin is. I'm all for showing the horrors of war in the hopes of ending the war.

&gt;And how many of those US have? Enough for full scale war? Or just for insurgencies?

I am sure they have enough. Production is limited now because there is no use for high numbers of ammunition. If full scale war broke out between the US and any near-peer opponent, production would surely be started again.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In Libya Europe had problems with insufficient number of smart bombs.

Not really. Europe forces used just around 7k pieces of munition. Almost all of that was guided in some way.

In the second gulf war and some years after US used 100k+ munitions of various kinds with around 80% of them being guided.

Production numbers for guided munition are lower than they were a few years back, but still US is producing 20k+ yearly.

If you are interested in current numbers: 

	Maverick: \~40k 

HARM: \~19k

CALCM: +300

JSOW: \~24k

Paveway (all): \~60k

JDAM: \~87k

WCMD: \~40k

And of course, you have more guided weapons, launched from different platforms, like a tomahawk.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Flying that far away and that high makes them exposed to normal anti air sike s300, s400, s35, Tor.

Anti air defense is not as simple as you may think. S300 series can have an impressive range on paper (300-400km) with some missiles, but in reality, there are a lot of factors to consider. In reality, you can get something like 50-100km with the longest range systems. Still, an impressive number but that can be further diminished. You can use electronic warfare and try to jam the radars, you can fly lower, use stealth or you can notch the radar. SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defense) and DEAD (Destruction of Enemy Air Defense) are tactics that aim to deny any action of SAM systems of the enemy. 

For example, the S300 system can track around 6 targets at once, depending on the variant. You can use multiple aircrafts to launch HARM antiradiation missiles combined with air launched decoys MALD and cruise missiles to overwhelm air defense. Suddenly air defense sites have to deal with hundreds of air targets. It can do nothing else than to try and destroy all incoming targets. Some will get through and destroy systems, others will just deplete missiles of the system and they cannot be replenished immediately.

The way Russian troops treat their own (from dealing with their wounded, dead, but also the examples of officers threatening to kill their own men and men even attacking or leaving behind their officers doesn't fit with the projected image.

The analysis by this Bulgarian analyst gives a very logical explanation for all of that.

You counter that pretty solid analysis by attacking the person and claiming that his views aren't facts.

They have a number of weaknesses. They don’t have full coverage around the aircraft, and usually can’t detect signals directly below and above the airframe - so during a banked turn, they may not detect an incoming missile that would ordinarily be visible.

Additionally, they are *radar* warning receivers. They can’t detect missiles using other tracking techniques, such as laser or infrared. Some very modern fighters have IRST (infrared search and track), although this may only be forward facing and for target acquisition.

Finally, some anti air systems have no emissions at all. In particular, a number of ex-Soviet systems can guide the missile optically, so there’s nothing to detect except perhaps the launch itself. Most missile systems only burn the rocket motor for a few seconds and then coast through the air, so unless you see it at the time of launch a missile will typically be invisible.",5e8bb039e38855c8ad07b1aaaf3c6a4091839985,True,False,,,,,0,1654531918,,0,{},ibdpoeb,False,t3_v5mes3,False,True,t1_ibbkkj3,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v5mes3/fighter_jet_of_unclear_origin_shot_down_in_the/ibdpoeb/,1654531933,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654503118.0,

Seen backwards by Billy, the story went like this: American planes, full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England. Over France, a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards, sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen. They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground, and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation.  
  
The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames. The bombers opened their bomb bay doors, exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires, gathered them into cylindrical steel containers , and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes. The containers were stored neatly in racks. The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own, which were long steel tubes. They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes. But there were still a few wounded Americans though and some of the bombers were in bad repair. Over France though, German fighters came up again, made everything and everybody as good as new.  
  
When the bombers got back to their base, the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America, where factories were operating night and day, dismantling the cylinders, separating the dangerous contents into minerals. Touchingly, it was mainly women who did this work. The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas. It was their business to put them into the ground, to hide them cleverly, so they would never hurt anybody ever again.”

1.  Some towed, like the M777, can be easily carried by a helicopter and moved rapidly to critical areas faster than an SPG. Some SPGS have tires instead of tracks and are heavy, making it hard to navigate in certain terrain/weather conditions.

2.  As someone mentioned, if an SPG's engine needs maintenance, you lose the whole gun.  With a towed piece, you just tow it with a different truck.  Way less maintenance.  The m777 specifically is also light enough to be towed by a regular truck which is another benefit for armies lacking dedicated military vehicles for their artillery.  Much more flexible. 

3.  You can put a towed piece a lot more places (on top of mountain inaccessible by road, in deep forests, in a farm shed etc..), hide it better (it is much smaller), and you also don't have the same, large, thermal signature. 

4. Although an SPG is much faster to set up, shoot, and move, modern towed pieces are also very fast too and the difference is much smaller than it used to be.

5. Some mentioned faster training, I haven't heard that before. Maybe some of the more complicated SPGs like the Pzh 2000 require more training and (obviously) you need training on driving/maintaining an SPG where a towed piece more-so just needs set-up, shoot, and take-down. 

6. Cost. You can buy a tracked, western, SPG for around 4-10M.  An older M198 developed during the same period costs like 500K and used ones are likely cheaper.",e6262e2bfb033690ed4fae530b67ab20bb3ff462,True,False,,,,,0,1654528894,,0,{},ibdiptt,False,t3_v5d4n0,False,True,t1_ibcx8lu,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v5d4n0/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_6622/ibdiptt/,1654528912,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654500094.0,

&gt;And the Russians, fighting a limited war against Ukraine with UN estimates of civilian dead only at ~1200, while Ukraine has a shit ton of logistical support from all of NATO, tens of thousands of ATGMs and MANPADs, and real time intelligence support?

&gt;Kind of important context when it comes to evaluating the Russian performance. It's apples to oranges to compare the two conflicts.

&gt;Not to mention everyone seems to be taking Ukrainian propaganda at face value, again and again; while questioning and dismissing any viewpoint which challenges the narrative that the Russians are too incompetent to even load their rifles correctly, and that they are completely demoralized and just about in wholesale retreat.

&gt;There is a very incomplete picture of what is happening in Ukraine on social media. And everyone has been awfully quick to decide that Russia has somehow ""failed"" because they didn't steamroll a NATO backed country like the US did Iraq. Zelenskyy isn't desperately begging every NATO country that he can get an audience with for a NATO enforced no-fly zone and more weapons because of how well things are going.

In the military the most similar spetsnaz unit is probably the SSO. They were formed in 2009 as a direct counterpart to JSOC and, as I understand it, fulfill a similar mission set. They’ve been heavily active in both Syria and Ukraine. 

Outside of the military the most similar is probably the FSB’s national CT units like Alpha and Vympel. They’re probably the most famous of Russia’s spetsnaz units, having originally been KGB units in the Soviet Union. They operate both in and outside of Russia, but their most famous actions, besides the attack that started the Soviet war in Afghanistan, have been domestic hostage crisis situations like the Moscow Theater Hostage Crisis and the Beslan School Crisis.

For the rest yeah, it sucks that france sell weapons to KSA, that's the less savory aspect of realpolitik. The lack of mention of yemen isn't some french press exceptionnalism tho. And comparing the number of caesar sold to ksa vs ukraine is dubious, simply because it took time to sell and manufacture them for ksa, time we had. Here it's a matter of weeks/months, far too short of a delay to build more caesar, in particular when the company doing them is already making as many as they can with ongoing commands. So I don't really see your point. Is it just to go on a tangent to say that france suck because of its alliance with ksa?

By that definition, most countries are imperial nations. Including your home country of China. As shameful as the U.S. history with Native tribes was/is, China is taking it to an entirely new level with the genocide of the Uyghurs and that's happening in 2022. Even Australia, in many ways, makes the U.S. treatment of its native population, look like downright humanistic. Yet, no serious person calls Australia an imperial power. 

Either way, regardless of whether you want to call the westward expansion in the U.S. and the war with Mexico imperialism, my specific point was that the U.S. doesn't have a lot of experience with **non-contiguous** expansion and never truly pursued it with vigor and as a matter of policy. Unlike monarchial powers like Great Britian, or the Ottoman's, there was no Empire building going on. 
You're clearly arguing for the sake of arguing, because this wasn't even the edifice we were discussing. This wasn't a conversation around the international relations definitions of imperialism, but one around nation building specific to Iraq and Afghanistan. And tactical battles and the quality of specific troops. 

&gt; 750 military bases in the territory of at least 70 other countries. Imagine if China had active military bases in Mexico and Canada lmao

Any and all of those countries are welcome to boot the U.S. out. When they were asked to leave Subic Bay, guess what? They left. Does the U.S. apply soft power? Of course it fucking does. But it's not going to war for any of those bases. That's definitionally the opposite of imperialism. As to China...lol. What do you think the Belt and Road initiative is? And no shit they don't have bases in Mexico and Canada. China has come a long way in a short period of time, but you were a literal shithouse country 50 years ago. I have deep admiration for the Chinese people and what they have been able to accomplish, but let's not try to polish a turd too hard. 

Again, I'm not getting into a deeper argument about what constitutes an imperial power and what doesn't. There are literally hundreds of books written on this topic with scholars on both sides of this debate. Read some of them so you stop having these child-life half-baked, half-understood ideas of these topics. Also, keep fan-girling me and following me around, lol.",725784a66b7cb4b5be9b373ea6fc6faa94796fc9,True,False,,,,,0,1654524884,,0,{},ibda3xx,False,t3_v5d4n0,False,True,t1_ibb2mq1,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v5d4n0/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_6622/ibda3xx/,1654524897,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654496084.0,

There are explosions in places where no rockets are landing, some of the explosions aren't even fuel air explosions and there is no way that they would fire this close to the front line, as any Ukrainian soldier with an anti-tank missile could take out the TOS.

There also isn't anything visible of the ""target"": no trenches, troop movements or anything else that indicates there being a genuine target.

Add the position of the camera, that is clearly stations in such a position to catch both the launch and landing of the rockets, and it ticks off all of the ""signs of this being propaganda"" boxes!

Even another 6 units will see the French Army suffer the equivalent of nearly 17% attrition in their stocks. 

Interestingly, the CAESAR is designed to replace the AMX-30 AuF1 of which France procured nearly 300 units (only 32 are in active service). 

Also of note is that the French army procured over 700k FAMAS rifles. It is being replaced with only 102k HK416F rifles. Not even enough to arm half of its armed forces. 

The point is, while France does have an active and advanced defense industry it is not capable of surging the numbers of weapons needed in a full scale war nor do they have the reserves needed to fill the gap while industry ramps up. The same can be said for the US but to a lesser degree. 

I do not want to have this sound like I am hammering away at the French. I happen to like France a lot and respect its military quite a bit. Heck, they deploy a *stunning* percentage of its active forces at any given time. There is simply not enough in reserve. And this is true of all of the European - and other - nations. 

With all that said, this war seems to have opened the eyes of the various Continental powers to the reality that minimal deterrence is not enough, that attrition happens extremely fast. The war in Ukraine has shown that companies and even entire battalions can be exterminated in a matter of hours - or less - along with their equipment. It has shown that troops in the field consume vast amounts of munitions, far more than peacetime planners ever imagined. Again, even the US with its much ballyhooed defense budget and procurement has discovered that it is burning through stock at very high rates. As with the consumer economy, resiliency was not given a premium or even much of a positive value for several decades.

It reminds me back in 2009 when I was at West Point for a summer seminar before applying. The “war on terror” was in full swing, and I always had a more pensive view than the gleefully patriotic ones that were around me. 

I remember stepping into the hallway filled with plaques covered in names of graduates who were killed in battle. 

I remember taking a shit one morning and seeing a memo posted on the back of the door that was essentially about compartmentalizing killing the enemy. 

I remember firing the 50 cal. browning (it had blanks), having the hot oil hit me in the face as I was firing, and the instructor using (and I’m not kidding) “Die, iraqi, die” as the phrase for timing your bursts to not warp the barrel. It was like full metal jacket come to life. 

And I just came away feeling more numb than ever towards the industry of mechanized killing. I’m not a pacifist, I know every great nation needs a great military. No shade to those who did it and graduated with honors. 

But me? I just imagine myself or a private under my command wriggling in a pit and dying. For what? 

At least for the Ukrainians their sad demise has meaning. It has glory. These guys? Just left in the dirt like the invaders they are.

The guy who invented IED tactics in the Spanish Civil War, Ilya Starinov and then went on to found the USSR Spetznaz (before being purged by Stalin, then being brought back) disseminated all of his knowledge to the USSR. 

Who then taught many different revolutionary groups across the globe, including Iraq/Afghanistan. I think the USSR had some contact with the IRA as well. 

If anything these are standard tactics, once the enemy has taken your land, partisans/special forces will deploy IEDs (either in advance or afterwards) to cause havoc in their rear lines. Like, they had a bomb in a hotel in Kharkov which was set to detonate upon a signal... which when detonated 3 weeks later killed Wehrmacht leadership of an entire army group.

He developed hundreds of IEDs and trained hundreds in how to make and deploy them against the Germans in WW2. Said teachings have continued through and no doubt Ukraine has its own school of thought base on his teachings.

As you've noted, I doubt it's the case. Corruption is flawed by design if we're looking from a country perspective, because the goals of corruption are different than the goals of having a prosperous country. Yes, we can argue that there are different levels of corruption (as every country has it, and there's a huge difference between them). I also think it's impossible to remove corruption.

In case of Russia, I think it's impossible and my gut feeling (which could be completely wrong) is that it's impacting Russia a lot. Why? You could compare companies with countries in regards to an organizational structure as well as a few other things. And something that makes a company successful (talking about bigger companies) are the strength of their processes, the quality of high level managers as well as the strength of middle-managers.

And corruption in the case of ultimate power to one person / short circle of people, means you favor loyalty more thank skill (probably there's more of a middle-ground here, but loyalty would be the core focus). And if the main gain is ultimate power for you (as well as wealth), you won't be building processes and systems that can work in a stable fashion, with a focus on efficiency. The key from the system is that you have power, not necessarily that it's the best system out there.

And there's no way 1 person is smart enough to create a perfect system that works this way (I find Putin incredibly intelligent, but he's far off from being able to create a perfect system where economy isn't impacted negatively).",ee8bfb542f2c15820cfcd0d95465aec99f0379a3,True,False,,,,,0,1654517565,,0,{},ibcwqy1,False,t3_v5d4n0,False,True,t1_ibcskbl,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v5d4n0/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_6622/ibcwqy1/,1654517577,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654488765.0,

As a typical pro Russian poster you certainly would say that. A few ""Signs of camaraderie"" from the Russians is easily countered by a lot of clear video evidence of the opposite happening.

But even more condemning is proof like this, which shows how pervasive the corruption and absolute lack of trust between the troops is in the Russian military:

It is clearly no surprise that the Russian military performs so much worse than the image of ""the world's second most powerful military"" that they have tried to uphold.

Those ""feelings and emotions"" don't change the fact that Russia is a very corrupt state with a military that is rotten to the core, with protection rackets, hazing, selling off of essential supplies on the black market and corruption being the norm, and not the exception.

The situation with ""closing the cauldron"" in the area west of Lisichansk is also unclear. Our people claim they are gradually advancing. The Ukrainians claim they ""firmly hold and counterattack"". We'll see. In any case, the stakes are quite high. It is unlikely that the AFU command already has the capacity to withdraw its grouping from the Severodonetsk-Lysychansk-Zolote area in an organized manner without defeating the retreating units and suffering very heavy losses in equipment and men.
The fiercest battles are now taking place there, with massive use of artillery, aviation and armored vehicles. And neither side can afford to end the battle ""in a draw"". The encirclement of the Ukrainians would be a severe defeat for them. Both militarily and politically. Failure to encircle would leave the Russian command unable to defeat even part of the enemy group in Donbass (after the failure to defeat the entire group already took place).

This has already happened, though you have to stretch the word 'friendly' to include KSA.. It's weird to me nobody on reddit mentions Yemen anymore.. Funny that. Just a quick google 'yemen bombed to the stone age', 'yemen genocide'. Nobody cares that France is the main driver of that. But every news channel is creaming over 18. Yes. Just 18, 30 year old artillery pieces sent against an army with thousands of artillery. 

&gt;Saudi Arabia: In 2006, GIAT announced a 76-unit sale plus a 4-unit option to an unspecified foreign customer, later confirmed to be Saudi Arabia.[16] The 4 optional units became firm sales in January 2007. The two first units will be assembled in France as the 78 other ones will be assembled in Saudi Arabia.[17] In March 2010, the Saudi Arabian National Guard (SANG) accepted its first four of a projected 100 systems.[18]

KSA will soon have more than twice as many CEASARS than France lol.


 France is the biggest arms dealer behind US and Russia. The top three countries who have capability to produce but don't gaf who the weapons are sold to. We replaced the UK because of the growing pressure on UK politicians through parliamentary committees and media backlash about bribing princes to secure contracts to arm genocide. The French press is much more controlled since the Gulf oil company debacle in the 70s, when French people demanded the end of Françafrique (which was reignited by Sarkozy- convicted of taking bribes from Gadhafi- and with a whipped French media that is controlled to never again mention the dirty murderous alliances to the mainstream).

Will Self, wrote a great polemic about this stuff that reddit and most people don't discuss properly.

The videos you posted are all three months old back from March. Two of them are short news reel clips containing nothing but talk and claims - still no footage appears of actual strikes. The third video seems to be a random set of clips with the title ""Ukraine's Top Fighter Jet Pilot, Known As Grey Wolf, Killed In Air Combat With Russian Troops"".

Does Ukraine have, or rather had, jets? Without a doubt. Are their airforce active? We have no way of knowing other than to deduce from the lack of footage from the Ukranian side regarding airstrikes compared to the Russian side. And the most likely answer here is no - their airforce is currently not active or existing in a coherent form.

Anti-drone tech in many regards is probably similar to traditional anti-aircraft technology. You've got heat-seeking technology using infrared cameras (and possibly other wavelengths of light) that use various ways to identify aircraft in an image, most likely using some form of edge detection and convolutional neural networks to identify and track high-contrast images. 

What I can say is that computer vision has dramatically improved in the last 10 years, but is now again starting to reach a local ceiling in terms of development. We can very successfully identify humans, cars, buildings, and various other objects in an image, and track them quite clearly. 

I'm assuming companies like Raytheon and other weapons manufacturers have been working on this problem for decades and know far more than I do. This might be a disappointing response, but I assume the next frontier of drone warfare in the near future is the asymmetrical costs for attacker vs. defender. Drones are cheap. Anti-drone missiles are not. It will be a game of numbers to overwhelm systems, with drones eventually being aided by anti-missile lock features such as quick lateral movements to evade various types of missiles. 

There was a video the other day of a drone getting shot down by a missile, and I assume that drone was at least 30-50cm wide, the sky was probably blue (not overcast) and within a specific range of the anti-aircraft battery. Drones that are 10cm across and stay low to the ground will be exceedingly difficult to shoot down or stop. I imagine this is where micro-drone warfare is headed. Lots of tiny drones flying low to the ground, probably armed with small explosives: anti-personnel drones designed to take out a single individual.",d86d0a291b4398e51dd8ceaef945e441e982ba4e,True,False,,,,,0,1654511380,,0,{},ibco2c6,False,t3_v2daev,False,True,t1_ib7j09x,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v2daev/ukrainian_drone_dropping_munitions_on_russian/ibco2c6/,1654511392,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654482580.0,

Those videos are posted in places where there is a large audience of interested people.  None here.  Relevance here? There are occasional posts from the Iraq made by insurgents.  There are many, many times more on Arab networks … ya know, for the audience.  

If you are telling me that English speaking majority of this sub is mostly Jonesing for Yemen shots vice Ukraine War (which caused this sub to explode), I’ll call bullshit.  

Day after day, some guy posts a few Houthi videos and not once have I seen even one of guys ask, “where are the Saudi videos?”  From the same war. They do exist. 

But if you find it odd that the Houthi, or someone terribly into them and no other, is suddenly posting videos from the same source on and English language sub?  This isn’t a smattering of someone who came across one or two he thought was cool, it is day after day of some guy posting just Houthi shit.  

Wouldn’t it make more sense just to post the link to the original source so you can Jones out to all the gore?

I get why Ukrainians post here and why Russians do.  There is significant interest by both sides in interacting with English speaking audiences given the flow of supply.  Neither the Saudis nor the Houthi, or even Iran for that matter, have any real interest in showing English audiences anything at all. Does Iran want a US audience to watch and wonder where Iranian backed rebels are getting there stuff?  At a time when Iran is bargaining for sanctions being lifted?

There maybe a perfectly logical reason, but it’s not to feed the pent up demand of just the Houthi in the Yemen War since 2014 for any English audience.  There is a small, mostly professional group of people I converse with about Yemen.  Behind that?  Americans genuinely don’t give a crap about Yemen.

Artillery projectiles can travel at around a kilometre per second, the difference in time is going to be a matter of seconds. Greatly improved accuracy will help make up for this.

&gt;If it will be necessary, then RF will turn it into ""experience ground"" for new conscripts or something different

Where are these new conscripts going to come from if Russia hasn't mobilized? If they haven't mobilized, Russia can't introduce conscription. Which means when the existing soldiers' contracts run out, or they want to rotate away for leave, there will be nobody to replace them.

&gt;Throw Ak-47 on UA soldiers and they them to fight tanks?

UA has enough ATGMs now to last forever, and NATO is not going to run out of ATGMs to supply to them. Russia on the other hand has lost a LOT of vehicles. https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html

&gt;No matter how low on soldiers RF would be, using enough artillery to not allow big coordinate assasult on RF positions would be pieace of cake for RF.

How can you not understand that if RF doesn't have troops to man a position, *there is no position?*

Let's say half of Russia's 200,000 men choose not to renew their contracts in the next couple of years, because nobody wants to be on a frontline of a nasty war forever. How will Russia replace them? They will have to literally give up large areas of territory in the Donbas, like half of what they've taken, because they simply are stretched too thin to hold the front.

And they're definitely not operating from NATO airbases, they would be too far from the front to be of use, and would be impossible to hide (and you can guarantee the Russian's would make the most of such a propaganda opportunity if they had any evidence).

  
The Russian's made a small attempt at hitting the bases in the first days of the war but failed. They haven't bothered much since then, they have neither the weapons or doctrine to do it. They now don't operate over Ukrainian territory beyond a couple of miles past the frontline so the Ukrainian air force is essentially able to operate as normal. The only weapons that the Russian's can use on Ukrainian airbases are a very limited number of Iskander, Kinzhal and cruise missiles. All are dependent on up to date intelligence and are inevitably planned hours before they can actually hit the target. The Ukrainian's have dispersed their aircraft effectively and move them regularly.

  
This war has utterly exposed the Russian Air Force's weaknesses. They cannot operate over enemy territory, they cannot get air superiority, limited stocks, limited quality and ability to use PGM's, practically zero ability to hit moving targets, very limited ISTAR capability, inability to use intelligence rapidly....basically a complete shitshow.

And that was exactly *one* example, one that surprised everyone who has been following this invasion!
 
&gt; It would be straight up ignorant to assume there is no sense of camaraderie between Russian soldiers.

It would be straight up ignorant to ignore the following:

-Draftees that get told beforehand that they need to pay contract soldiers of the unit that they are going to, just to prevent getting harassed.

-Draftees that need to pay a monthly protection money to prevent getting their boots and other stuff stolen by the contract soldiers.

-Draftees having to pay superiors for their own food when they are drafted!

-Draftees being put through a hazing ""ceremony"" when they get to their unit.

-Russian superiors selling off stuff that is supposedly allocated to the soldiers, such as the armour plates of vests, fuel for their vehicles and money allocated for exercises, while keeping the troops in the barracks.

-Russian officers buying their position in the military through bribes, without showing any capabilities of being capable of handling such a position.

I haven't even mentioned the stuff the Russian maffia does to soldiers... The ones coming back from Syria had to pay a considerable part of their pay to the maffia.

-Then there are the commanders who have kept inflating the numbers of soldiers under their command, taking the pay for the guys who signed up but who left before the grace period was over, while staying signed into the roster.

And that is all before even going into battle, because there things get much worse:

-Russian superiors pulling back from the front lines while letting their lower ranking soldiers sit there, taking incoming fire, not knowing what to do.

-Russian soldiers walking past wounded members of their unit and just leaving them to fend for themselves!

-Russian troops leaving dead unit members just lying there while they move out.

-Russian troops being told to go on suicide missions to the same spot on the front line, day after day, with units being treated like expendable cannon fodder.


&gt; Soldiers of Every nation get very close and build special “brother like” bonds with the men they serve with.

I was in the army. The way I was treated and how I treated my comrades was nothing like what we see in the Russian army!

You're trying to make this seem like it is the norm, but it most certainly isn't in the Russian army!

&gt; As much as you can disagree with what their government is telling them to do Russian soldiers are Human too

This has nothing to do with ""Russian soldiers being human too""! It has everything to do with the whole state being corrupt to the core, with human lives meaning nothing to the ones in charge of both state and military, and the lower ranks knowing full well that they are the ones who get to pay the price for that!

Poland would have a rough time with Ukraine (even if we remove support from the West for both parties). Keep in mind, prior to the invasion in February, based on reports, Ukraine had the second-largest army in Europe (by number of troops). It's a vast country that makes it hard to capture fully.

There are not that many countries, if any, that could have used their peace time army and had a favorable result in Ukraine. Capturing the whole country would be impossible, so more thinking of the lines of surrender.

We can say that every country would have struggles with Ukraine (some more some less), and aside of the US, any other country would have a big problem with Ukraine.

That is true, but people aren't mocking Russia while comparing it with other countries. People mock Russia because of perception the Russian government tried to create (let's even say, successfully created), that they're the second most powerful army in the world and others should fear it (even without counting the nuclear weapons here)

And then, you have a powerful country that makes the biggest blunder in the world. Not to mention, it's a country that, in the last 100 years, only in 2 of those (feel free to correct my count, I may have missed by a few years) they weren't part of a conflict.

That's why people mock Russia. Not because other countries would fare better. But other countries are not on the same level as Russia, on paper, at least.

This doesn't mean Russia will simply lose now, they may achieve some major objectives (whatever their objectives really are), but they had the worst possible strategy in a conventional war, at the start of it.",57c521e5d646f594da58343d8ee5056bce104b62,True,False,,,,,0,1654504460,,0,{},ibcgi23,False,t3_v5d4n0,False,True,t1_ibc98ub,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v5d4n0/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_6622/ibcgi23/,1654504470,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654475660.0,

The Egyptians did very well at the beginning of the war. They managed to cross the Suez Canal, which was a major feat. They repelled and inflicted massive losses on a large Israeli armored counterattack using ... Soviet anti-tank guided missiles. Their Soviet-provided SAM bubble neutralized the Israeli air force.

Everyone acknowledges the superiority of the Israeli air force. They dominated their opponents, even when they (the Israelis) were using manifestly inferior equipment. Training and experience make a massive difference for an air force (just look at how certain aces have vastly better combat performance than the average pilot), and Israel, at the time, probably had the best pilots in the world.

The Egyptians took heavy losses when they ventured beyond their SAM bubble and were exposed to the Israeli air force. Their initial plan had been not to venture out that far, but they eventually did so in order to relieve pressure on the Syrians.

I have no firsthand experience with laying artillery, but this is my understanding...

While I don't know what they see in that specific sight, in old school indirect fire without computer control and electronic sensors, you would need to look into a sight that showed the true inclination of the bore. I believe sights also incorporated azimuth from the zero line. The piece is not going to be perfectly plumb to earth, so you need to know true inclination, and when not plumb in in X/Y (think parking on a hill that is sloping down and to the side) changing the azimuth would also change the true inclination from your previous shot even without adjusting the pitch of the barrel. I imagine they have graduations allowing to quickly adjust based on range and direction adjustments. 

This is why they are turning the dials and checking the bore position through the sites. 

I imagine the expensive advanced indirect systems built in the present have extremely accurate gyro or laser sensors and it's a matter of entering in GPS coordinates, the gun is auto aimed (probably accounting for real time humidity, air temp/density and wind when available), and if a correction called you just input the correction distances and it calculates it all instantly and aims. 

That type of stuff is probably pretty expensive and but I imagine even on commodity level artillery they still have some amount of sensors/computers to help fix points in the sight and you turn the dials to put the sight on the point, and the electronics are on the fritz or go down you revert to full manual.

Hopefully someone who trained with big artillery can give a more informed answer, but the tldr is the sights don't actually see the target but need the sights to see exactly where the barrel is pointed in terms of elevation relative to earth and azimuth (direction of fire, usually relative to some type of fixed zero line). You need to be able move your bore to the exact inclination and direction once you have calculated what those should be set at.

\&gt;On February 25 1991 the war correspondent Leon Daniel arrived at a battlefield at the tip of the neutral zone between Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Daniel was one of a pool of journalists who had been held back from witnessing action the previous day, when Desert Storm's ground war had been launched. There, right where he was standing, 8,400 soldiers of the US First Infantry Division - known as the Big Red One - had attacked an estimated 8,000 Iraqis with 3,000 Abrams main battle tanks, Bradley fighting vehicles, Humvees and armoured personnel carriers.  
Daniel had seen the aftermath of modest firefights in Vietnam. ""The bodies would be stacked up like cordwood,"" he recalled. Yet this ferocious attack had not produced a single visible body. It was a battlefield without the stench of urine, faeces, blood and bits of flesh. Daniel wondered what happened to the estimated 6,000 Iraqi defenders who had vanished. ""Where are the bodies?"" he finally asked the First Division's public affairs officer, an army major. ""What bodies?"" the major replied.  
Months later, Daniel and the world would learn why the dead had eluded eyewitnesses, cameras and video footage. Thousands of Iraqi soldiers, some of them firing their weapons from first world war-style trenches, had been buried by ploughs mounted on Abrams tanks. The tanks had flanked the lines so that tons of sand from the plough spoil had funnelled into the trenches. Just behind the tanks, straddling the trench line, came Bradleys pumping machine-gun bullets into Iraqi troops.  
""I came through right after the lead company,"" said Colonel Anthony Moreno. ""What you saw was a bunch of buried trenches with people's arms and legs sticking out of them. For all I know, we could have killed thousands.""  
Two other brigades used the same tank-mounted ploughs and Bradleys to obliterate an estimated 70 miles of defensive trenches. They moved swiftly. The operation had been rehearsed repeatedly, weeks before, on a mile-long trench line built according to satellite photographs. The finishing touches were made by armoured combat earth-movers (ACEs). These massive bulldozers, with armoured cockpits impervious to small-arms fire, smoothed away any hint of the carnage. ""A lot of guys were scared, but I enjoyed it,"" said PFC Joe Queen, an ACE driver awarded a Bronze Star for his performance in the battle.",3662f705c0133d2c4b2b69796617cf0ae5290015,True,True,,,,,0,1654494612,,0,{},ibc5reg,False,t3_v5l8li,False,False,t1_ibc5bw8,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v5l8li/hts_tank_run_over_isis_militants_during_htsisis/ibc5reg/,1654494624,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654465812.0,

It's true that Russia in a number sense is more corrupt than Ukraine, but there are 2 fundemental differences here. Ukraine corruption is involuntary. Every president in the elections spoke up to fix, it. Peoples confidence relied on reforms, but they never escaped the problem after a decade it became hot topic (2012), causing a lot of problems for all the involving  circle of the Ukraine's prosperity. (there is a good economics explained Video on YouTube) 

Russia ( putin mostly) took its corruption problem, gifted from Yeltsins 2 term fails itself,  a more interesting approach, They steered corruption as a power exerciser. Putin guaranteed the oligarchs loyalty to him by mutual cooperation, you get spoils, I get spoils and extra wealth can go into the economy. I don't fight your corruption so the power structure and money doesn't get disturbed(there were people tried to disturb it but FSB and Putins inner circle is tight) . He used this power structure to create a deliberate autocracy after getting public support for ending Yeltsins failures in exchange for democracy. A strongman of Russia as feature history calls it...

As for the maintenance costs of a big nation.nukes are just ridiclous costly, to the point Ukraine had to dismantle theirs so that they can get some sort of economic relief from USA.

And rest of the Russia's military is the same... Expensive to maintain and cause for poverty in the country. But context matters about if it's spending more or less... Now biggest military in the world and"" overspend"", criticised and controversial US military slurps 3-3.5% of its GDP, Nato requires every member state to allocate at least %2 of its GDP.(Which countries openly reported they struggle to spend that much)While Russia spends 4-4.2% of its on its own Military. Which considering their size of it, the warheads, old stockpiles and its small base economy compared to powerhouse of the US.

The Polish military was planning on purchasing ~550 IFVs before this all started. Now it looks like they are going to purchase 1,000. Why? Because attrition is real. 

The US, with its seemingly ridiculous defense budget, is the primary source for weapons but even it is discovering that actual expenditures of weapons is dramatically higher than anticipated. 

Of course, this was all foreseen 30 years ago after the Gulf War. But, with the fall of the Soviets there was not much tolerance for procurement. Especially and particularly amongst the Europeans but even the US stockpiles suffered. Throw in a handful of conflicts and the depth of stockpiles never really recovered. Ever. Not even a little bit. 

Suddenly, there is a no kidding shooting war. One side has pluck, the other side deep reserves of munitions. The question is, will pluck endure long enough to overcome the crush of numbers?

Partially it is that Ukraine has chosen to defend the hardest in built-up areas - They know this terrain greatly amplifies the defender.

Partially it is to do with the way they use their BTG.

* The Russians pick a target and throw BTG at it (900 men, Heavy Weapons, tanks and APC).
* Because the Russians do not have a flexible command structure it might be 'take X building 1km into the town'.
* **This is not a small force and once the attack kicks off it is better to let it use its initial energy in pushing into town a way**. The Russians will be hyped on Adrenaline, Fear and also on the target they have been given.
* As they withdraw the Ukrainians pick off easy targets (Tanks, APCs, future Heroes of the Soviet Union who charge ahead). They withdraw into and through pre-arranged artillery zones making sure the Russians follow them.
* The Artillery hits, Ukraine mops ups the remnants
* Wash Rinse Repeat.
* After a while the BTG starts to weaken from tiredness, lack of supply and Command &amp; Control, casualties, fear etc.
* Due to the nature of Urbane warfare Ukraine will start popping up behind them, cutting them off, attacking them at their weakest.
* The Russians withdraw

So yeah... Russia 'takes' their objective but cannot hold it.

The only reason this is working so well is because the Russian BTG concept is inherently flawed (for them) and because they did not learn the lessons of Stalingrad it keeps getting repeated time and time again.",d4f62cc32fcb1e95665c264096b89ea8c43227b4,True,False,,,,,0,1654488059,,0,{},ibbwrxd,False,t3_v5jg8g,False,True,t1_ibbrl3k,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v5jg8g/footage_of_ukrainian_defenders_in_battle_with/ibbwrxd/,1654488076,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654459259.0,

Ukraine even did a report and found that the ammunition they were capturing was about 70%-96% from the Soviet era (smalls arms/grenades, not artillery).  That said:

1.  The Soviet era stuff got split up when the SU broke apart.  Russia got the Lion's share, but a lot ended up spread out in Poland, Czechia, Slovakia, East Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, Estonia, Ukraine, Moldova, etc... Especially shells, they're heavy and they need huge buildings to store them. There's a metric fuck-ton allegedly rotting away in Transnistria. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobasna_ammunition_depot

2.  A ton of the old Soviet stuff is worthless. Ukraine experienced this earlier in 2014 when they tried to use their Soviet era stockpiles.  Tons of poorly maintained shells didn't detonate properly. That said, corruption, poor maintenance, shell-types effects, etc.. vary.  Every country is different. Ukraine might have been particularly effected. https://englishrussia.com/2011/07/12/how-is-russian-ammunition-stored/

“Lately, I am often in Siverodonetsk and its surroundings, and I am surprised by the repeatedly inappropriate statements of some executives regarding the operational situation in Luhansk region. On the day of President Zelensky's visit to Luhansk region, the head of the VA Gaidai announced the attack and the release of 50% of the city. Unfortunately, this information is not true.

In war, you have to deceive the enemy, not your citizens. In this case, Ukrainian society must receive information close to reality, we need real victories, not fictional ones.

The risk of self-deception in war is that false fabrications and unjustified optimistic statements drive units, people, and make decisions in a way that too do not fit the situation. Stop these puns, you don't have to do this.

Ukrainian warriors hold positions in a difficult environment, and this environment requires if not all the truth, then at least the absence of lies. Otherwise, it causes concern whether the executives understand what is really happening.

Two days ago, the opponent went out on the outskirts of the city, currently our troops are defending the Severodonetsk industrial zone and the adjacent quarter.

The regular message of the desired instead of the valid causes concern.

The Su-57 is a 5th generation fighter by all characteristics, it was designed to be one from the start.

The only thing experts have said is when talking about the prototypes, especially mentioning the problem of hiding panel lines with the engines used, but these are not a problem in the [serial production aircraft](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EqFLx4YXAAEZsuK?format=jpg&amp;name=large).

The only other disadvantage the Su-57 has in it's stealth design is not using S ducts for the intakes but this is a compromise.

Could you tell me which experts are you talking about  Steve Trimble the one i found refers to problems with the prototypes not the serial production aircraft 

Sukhoi has never stated anything about the RCS of the, the only source is the sukhoi patents in china wich are from 2013 and should be taken with a grain of salt.

T-50 is the prototypes there is only 5 serial Su-57's 6 if you count the one that crashed in 2019 before entering in service",58d2200c223911e6c138ed010f170c9951418a19,True,False,,,,,0,1654484063,,0,{},ibbq4kb,False,t3_v5d084,False,True,t1_ibbm49y,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v5d084/alleged_use_of_the_kh59mk2_airtosurface_guided/ibbq4kb/,1654484074,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654455263.0,

The low RCS aircraft is backscattering so little energy that anything that returns to the radar can't be distinguished from noise. If you didn't filter out the noise, then the entire scope would be filled with noise. 

You're right that the target signal slowly increases as the target gets close. However, it doesn't matter if S/N is low and below the threshold of detection. 

&gt;This myth that planes are ""literally invisible"" on radar is just that. I have no idea how it started but on echo chambers like Reddit, it becomes ""fact"" after it is said long enough.  

Sufficient S/N is a prerequisite for visibility. By your claims, stars during the day are just as visible as they are at night. If the S/N is low enough, then the target is invisible. Just substitute ""undetectable"" for ""invisible"" if you feel like it.",b5a6e0878e342d3e7cc39ff9dc9bce03e3f99457,True,False,,,,,0,1654482863,,0,{},ibbnv0h,False,t3_v5d084,False,True,t1_ibb5q4h,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v5d084/alleged_use_of_the_kh59mk2_airtosurface_guided/ibbnv0h/,1654482874,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654454063.0,

Syria. Russia claims 63,000 troops were sent to Syria. In early January 2017, the Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Valery Gerasimov said that, overall, the Russian Air Force had carried out 19,160 combat missions and delivered 71,000 strikes on ""the infrastructure of terrorists""

  
At the end of December 2017, the Russian defence minister said that the Russian military had eliminated several thousand terrorists while **48,000** Russian service-members had ″gained combat experience″ during the Russian operation in Syria.  


The combat experience these 48,000 or so soldiers gained, could be everything from loading CAS jets with bombs at a safe airstrip, military policing, pilots, logistics to special forces kicking down the doors of HVT. Do I think most of these 48,000 are in Ukraine now? No I don't. But let's say all of them had ground based, real combat experience, and all of them are in Ukraine now. That's 24% of the total 190,000-200,000 estimated troops in Ukraine now.

The only way it would even know that the emissions are ""friendly"" is if it can detect them to then label them as such. Additionally, there is no way that the Russian military wouldn't know that radar emissions from Ukrainian migs are probably similar if not identical, and would likely not be filtering them out, as then you would be getting locked without knowing it. What is far more likely in my enthusiast opinion is that this was either a laser guided missile, or a heat seeking missle that did not require a radar lock to track, or it was a missile fired from a platform capable of track while scan missle operations. That being said, I find it unlikely that it would be fired from a tws lock, as the terminal stage of a missle fired in TWS mode would still have the missle transition to active radar target tracking.

By RODION_MIROSHNIK the ambassador of LPR in RF:


There is active destruction of firing points and equipment of Ukrainian militants in Lisichansk and on the Privolnyansky bridgehead.
From the suburbs of Lisichansk and Privolye, Ukrainian batteries fired incessantly at the suburbs of Severodonetsk, from where they had been knocked out not so long ago. The allied troops reached the western border of Sirotino and temporarily left Lesnaya Dacha due to heavy shelling from Lisichansk by the Ukronazis to save the lives of the civilian population. But the Ukrainian troops did not enter the Sirotino and Lesnoy summer houses areas.

At the same time, precision strikes were carried out in Lisichansk. At least 6 vehicle clusters destroyed. The remaining groups are hiding in residential areas and in the area of     the old car market near the concrete road, hiding behind a temple near the source. These places of accumulation of equipment will be destroyed in the near future.
 
In addition, there is an active destruction of the enemy grouping in the Privolye region. The Ukrainian terrorists, who were previously at the electric plant at the Privolnyanskaya mine, were completely destroyed - a cluster of equipment, personnel and ammunition. As a result, the shelling, along the same Privol, ceased.

Cleansing the suburbs of Lisichansk and Privolye from Ukrainian artillery will make it possible to stop the round-the-clock shelling that is still going on at Severodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kremennaya and complete the complete liberation of the “triangle”.

The Iraq invasion started in 2003 and this poll you are talking about was done in 2007, which is 4 years after. At that time Americans started to realize that the Iraq invasion was a ""mistake"". That's why people started to change their opinion.

Below poll is mentioned right in the Wikipedia page. Are you blind or something to not see that?!!

A Gallup poll made on behalf of CNN and USA Today concluded that 79% of Americans thought the Iraq War was justified, with or without conclusive evidence of illegal weapons. 19% thought weapons were needed to justify the war.[12]
