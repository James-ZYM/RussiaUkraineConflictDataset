According to some news, Russia has now deployed approximately 76 BTGs and more other troops such as 1-2 brigades of the marines (in total about 60000 men, which is pretty reasonable possibly 10 more coming from the Siberian fronts), in a one-half to one-third rule, there are about 25-39 of them currently fighting on the frontlines. A standard Russian BTG contained in normal brigades (instead of being independent battalions) is about 800-1000 men, containing \~10-20 tanks and \~50-60 IFV/APV/other vehicles each, if you evenly distribute these numbers into 39 BTGs (I know some areas suffered harder fighting, but this is just for convenience), it will be a loss of:

21 tanks, 54 IFV/APVs, and 538 troops per BTG.

Meaning that: in average a Russian BTG \~100% of the tanks, \~100% of armored vehicles, and 50-70% of men. 

Or if you count the 76 BTGs in total:

276 men, 10 tanks, and 27 vehicles.

Considering that most groups in the southern front didn't go through hard fighting and urban warfare, it means that at least 50% of the BTGS deployed in the Donbass area had lost fighting capacity or meaning that most troops deployed in there had suffered extremely heavy damage.

 Because one day someone will take that choice from us. It'll be our governments.

P.S there is a movie based on Britain going to war with itself I think, anyway. The point is; some regiments chose sides and we follow a character who is with lots of civilians... there was a farm they were taken to and slaughtered by what they saw as their own side. 

I wish one day I can walk amongst other people from any place on earth; and experience them living their lives. And one day I wish to express ultimate destruction protecting said peoples, from rogue elements in the societies. With a touch on their forehead and a laugh bellowing out; the aggressors vanish in blinding light. Perhaps only their clothes and equipment remain.

The largest advantage that the PLA has is its numbers and its ability to draw from a large pool of recruits.

Details: Wikipedia has a large article on rashism now. It explains the origin of the term, the history of its occurrence, the main characteristics.

Wikipedia defines rashism as a kind of totalitarian, fascist ideology, a symbiosis of the basic principles of fascism and Stalinism.

It became the rationale for the barbaric geopolitics of the Russian Federation, aimed at the occupation and annexation of the territories of other states, which is often stamped as ""the gathering Russian lands,"" and relies on local collaborationism and the support of the Russian fifth column.

Abe will be re-elected and will change

Then I could have continued to receive treatment for my illness.
Shit.
In the meantime, I have no choice but to die.
It is my only salvation.
And why change the Constitution now? Because we can force through a constitutional amendment now, which is full of unnecessary things and full of opposition!

Do the math. 2mill troops at a minimum. Japan has, what? 125mill people? 2 mill troops is conservative. More likely they need 2,5-3mill.

How many troops can they carry per ship with all of their equipment? 1000 give or take. Even if every ship did two trips before they got sunk that's easily 1000 deep sea capable ladning craft. Where on earth would they get them all from? Even China cannot build 1000-1500 landing craft any time soon.  

If China starts to build that kind of fleet, Japan will have ample time to stock up on  10000 naval strike missiles, that's 10 missiles per ship. Enough to make any landing attempt futile. They will not need to sink all, just enough to make any landing doomed, and the rest will just turn back. Japan is too far away.

But there are some videos on YouTube from official sources and from the bravest local testimonies recorded on video.   


 And for the Russians who were filmed giving humanitarian aid, you must be referring to the city of Mariupol maybe. It is given to those who are pro-Russian and have nothing at all against the occupation, or are simply exhausted people who have not been let out of the city or have not been able to escape, so they have no other choice. Because those people who resisted are simply killed or exiled to Russia with their papers/documents taken away. Around 400 000 people have been forcibly taken away. Because why would they keep people in the city who could interfere with the occupation, plus they can make nice videos for their national channels and for the international community about how well they are doing here and how they are saving people.   


One very basic fact to remember in this war is that it was Russia that invaded Ukraine, not Ukraine that invaded Russia. It is therefore particularly important for the Russians to create as many pretexts as possible to justify aggression.

Problem is that this images arent from the 1995 campaign but that of 1999 during the Kosovo crisis. Were Serbia army and the Albianan KLA were fighting each other for the future of Kosovo. The air campaign got a lot of flak internal and external as the focus became more and more Belgrade and ""military"" instalations there (a lot of the information collected by the intellegence was outdate causing bombing of civilian sites and the Chinese Ambessy). The public did not take it nicely that Nato was bombing civilians to stop Serbian bombing Kosovar Albians indiscrimenant. Add to that at the mid of the campaign Serbia wasnt stopping and own cruelties of KLA became more public. 

At the end Nato would switch more to military targets in Kosovo forcing the end. But the campaing remained controversial. Looking from diplomatic point, the early till mid stage of the campaign had been massive blunder. The high civilian causalties has made Serbia highly  hostile towards Nato (not the EU as Serbia is in the pre-programma of becoming member candidate), which caused to align more towards Russia again, and more dangerousily for the EU to China.

Now you can say so what, who cares about the Serbs. Well, for Nato and the EU Serbia is, in the long run, the last puzzle piece for the Balkans. Getting Serbia in the Nato would close the Balkan flank and make the integration of the remaining states possible, also solving some of the last frozen conflicts in the region. The solving of Bosnian compromise, making it functional state and getting it on its way to European integration, is only possible with Serbian infleunce, similar the with Kosovo.

They use two sources for this: Unnamed 'European official' with no merit, experience or background listed, at all. If source is unnamed (normal when subject is sensitive and anonymity is paramount), at least something should be given to make sure the readers could decide whether the source is trustworthy or experienced in the subject. Other source for any of this is Russian minister Shoigu who has vested interest to not tell the truth. So take everything in this news story with a grain of salt.

&amp;#x200B;

* The amount of troops is **between** 10.000 and 20.000, 16.000 said in few places. 
* ""there has been **some** ""transfer"" of fighters from Libya and Syria to the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine."" Note the use of word ""some"". As Wagner was at most 6.000 men strong, this would mean the ""some"" would have to at minimum 4.000 and at maximum 14.000 men from Syrian and Libya. It is possible the troops are still in transit, but there has been zero reports of this sized troop movements by planes or ships.
* Troops are just men, **no** vehicles, tanks or artillery.
* To be used against Ukranian resistance **only**.
* Troop cost monthly is between 12 million dollars ($600 per) and 60 million dollars ($3000 per). So in few months the cost will be closer to or exceeding hundred million dollars. There is no news where this money would be gathered as Russia has already been in trouble trying to pay their debts in dollars.
* The same source (European official) estimates current Russian force in the war as **only** 60.000 men or 76 battalion tactical groups. This is significantly less than just two moths ago. (as a context, at the start of the war, Russia had about 200.000 soldiers at borders ready to go).

So in the end, it's not as groundbreaking if anyone reads behind the sensational title.

Perhaps. But perhaps if we had actually taken a stand instead of bitching out whenever georgia got attacked, we could have stopped this from happening. Wishful thinking, perhaps, but even so.

\&gt; I think working on infrastructure and working to fix health care would definitely be better use of taxpayer money.

It would, yes. No one's denying that. I'm certainly not. 

However, do you really think they would stop with Ukraine? Fuck no. The moment they're done raping and pillaging and looting and slaughtering every man, woman and child and then absorbing whatever remains into their sphere of influence and putting up their puppet, they would have just moved on to the next country did the same thing, over and over again until they have their old Soviet satellites. Poland, like Ukraine, was one of their former satellites and Poland is now part of NATO.

All this time spent debating, pussyfooting around, that we're doing? It's just working more in Russia's favor than it is ours. 

\&gt; I still don’t see how chasing monsters abroad has helped foreign policy in the US. 

No one said it did. However, we have an obligation to the rest of NATO to follow through on our alliances with the rest of the countries in NATO. 

\&gt;Seems like it only weaken us and put so much debt on future generations. 

What weakens us is our political parties. 

None of these people, these politicians, who...honestly I don't even like even calling them human, ever gave a shit about us. If they did, then they would keep their word instead of blaming the other side for their failures. Then they rile up their bases and have people like you and I go to bat for them while they sit back and sip from another cocktail or whatever the fuck as they refuse to do their fucking job, while we fight and kill each other over the stupidest shit like mask mandates or vaccines. 

\&gt;Even senators are pushing to stop SS for gen z and below.

They would have done this regardless. Again, our senators, our politicians, mostly don't give a single solitary fuck about us. A big part of why we can't even get proper healthcare is because of this...mudslinging bullshit we have with our two main parties. Thing is, this would have happened even if Putin's forces didn't roll into Ukraine and start massacring and raping men, women, and children.",5ea8f9183d1251e0843f938855a5d8e2c2e51b34,True,False,,,,,0,1650526525,,0,{},i5l97pl,False,t3_u76hgq,False,True,t1_i5l6kct,/r/war/comments/u76hgq/11000_troops_and_high_tech_us_weapons_in_poland/i5l97pl/,1650526541,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1650497725.0,

Nobody should lay down their arms when a country tries to take over or conquer your country! What are you suggesting? Ukraine open the borders wide? Tell the russians to come and take what they want? That they belong to russia? 

Death isnt pretty, nobody wants death, nobody wants to be a corpse on a battlefield. You want to be at peace with your loved ones doing nice things.

BUT, in a world where laws arent honored, be that the local criminal robbing the mom and pop shop or the tyrant invading another country, bombing cities indiscriminately, your civilian populating outright targeted, you must simply lay down your arms? Next thing you will propably say is, ""well the civilians wont get killed if there isnt fighting."" Do you know what it is like living under russian rule? Being brainwashed and lied too, being arrested if you say anything against the ""special military operation""?   
A lot of the older people in Ukraine grew up under the old USSR, they now what it was and they know what will come if they sit back and welcome putins pawns. 

Yes I am typing this from my chair, not on the battlefield, its easy to type, but what is the alternative for these people in the actual situation? They have a military and civilians with a strong enough backbone to stand up, realizing they might die horribly. They are in the field and see every day what happens to a human body when struck with hot metal.

  
If I know a force is coming to cause harm to the ones I love, I would like to think I would stand up and fight, rather to see them hurt and suffer. History has told us, if we dont stand up and fight those trying oppress us, you suffer so much in the long run, especially under tyrants.

The difference is that Woke Up! is saying something that is counter narrative and sometimes mildly funny. Shocking! The media 'infers' its own bias and slant all the time. It's only noticeable when it's not the same tired pro-government propaganda. Maybe these guys are spouting nonsense. I don't know, but I don't trust them any more or less than NBC or CNN or Fox News. If you seriously think everything you read in the media 'is assumed that is a direct quote or idea' ... you're not paying attention. This leak is verified elsewhere. Look it up if you are open to being wrong. 

As to 'F'ing off about Russia, woke bs' as you so eloquently put it - I'm not pro-Putin and I'm not pro-Ukraine. I have no dog in the race of international politics that you or I can't change anyway (*unless you're Joe Biden, then you really can't change anything*). The world isn't black and white and I'm not going to cheer the 'heroes' and jeer the 'villains' that the government and media have written for us in their global theatre.

I have nothing to do with the website other than being a fan so I would suggest sending them an angry tweet or continue tilting at windmills here on reddit if you like. 

That's all for me friend. We're clearly not going to see eye to eye intellectually speaking ... as in that regard, you're clearly a midget (sorry, forgot to be 'Woke') a 'little person'.

While it also had some industry and still could used as an assembly area for German troops. But as we now know much of the information gathered about it was completely false or overblown.

David Irving who is responsible for writing the book Destruction of Dresden and this led to many of the ideas we believe today such as it being a refugee city, or there was no strategic target in the city, or even the large death toll of 185,000-350,000 are all false. Much of these were disproven when the document that “confirmed” these casualties, TB-47 was proven to be false. As A: the man who “confirmed” these casualties Deputy Chief Medical Officer Funfack was not even a Deputy Chief Medical Officer and was just an urologist and a civilian, not involved in anyway with the listing casualties. And B: the real TB-47 was found in the late 60s-early 70s and completely discredited all of Irving’s findings. The real casualty amount was around 18,000-35,000 instead of a 185,000-350,000 list. These higher numbers were actually made from Joseph Goebbles who used this as a propaganda piece and inflated the numbers from what they were actually were.

Even if you try to say this was a war crime even with the lower casualty list, it makes no sense to call it so. What the Germans did during the war are some of most heinous war crimes in human history. The blitz on London killed 60,000 people, double of what Dresden was. The attack on the neutral Netherlands and the blitz on Rotterdam, this left thousands homeless and killing hundreds, not to mention invading a neutral country. Or how about when the Germans went into Kiev during their invasion of Russia, gathered “undesirables” up and lined them across a riverbank and machined gunned them down weekly killing tens of thousands. Or the siege of Leningrad where 97% of the deaths were caused by starvation and this landed for two years. Where hundreds of thousands died of a slow painful, suffering death of hunger and hypothermia. And let’s not forget the Holocaust...

The point is that Dresden gets way more attention due to a lie perpetuated by a bad historian. And it has carried into our perception of history when the reality of the attack is that it was a valid military target and while tens of thousands died, it was not the hundreds of thousands that Irving lied about.",1fd1d09c8570b3c9666f35a4783863c5cbf17a0f,True,False,,,,,0,1650514808,,0,{},i5kso71,False,t3_u7ri72,False,True,t1_i5k5z5u,/r/war/comments/u7ri72/a_deep_bunker_could_not_protect_ukrainian/i5kso71/,1650514819,1,True,True,False,war,t5_2qhk8,r/war,public,,0,[],,1650486008.0,

This drastically changed over the cold war; where we seen the pinnacle of death machines I.e soldiers and combined arms of superior technological armies; in the Iraq Gulf war. 

Everyone is trained to kill; and to add to their experience they also have the ability to call in air strikes and artillery strikes. A team of soldiers who get hit by random ak.47 fire may return with Mortar fire; only to have a tank return greetings. After that an artillery strike is called in on the tank and then counterbattery is received and then we have the airstrike to deal with that and the whole entire reserve line that would be moving in to reinforce the original random Ak.47 team that is now dead.

One random encounter entails an ensuing series of escalation that can leave a thousand people dead from both sides.

These two dead soldiers is mere collateral and a small price to pay; there are countless people to fill their boots but perhaps not enough time to actively plan out the least riskiest battle plan. Yes; in close combat their superior local firepower resolves a conflict flashpoint really quickly. Firefights are vicious and can be over quickly. A lot of the shooting is suppression fire; random shots to keep heads down and to make sure there is a reply.

Infantry is the real rooted power of the military as they can hold ground. Their job is after all the fighting to do just that. All the weapons created are used in support of these people we dress up in cosplay tacticool.

One weapon system can devastate a hundred soldiers; guided by one skilled operator and a coordinator.

My comment/question is. Has the primary combat ""platform"" drastically changed or do military organizations ""hide"" or refocus the glorification of battle? 
My reason for this diatribe is, the idea that the likelihood of death or serious injury is significantly out of your hands and down to chance, as the result of an air strike or remote rocket strike VS being somewhat more in your control by hand to hand/ gun to gun combat.
