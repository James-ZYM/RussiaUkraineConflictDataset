The Kremlin’s declaration of victory in Mariupol is unlikely to enable the deployment of significant combat power to reinforce offensive operations in eastern Ukraine in the coming days or weeks.

Russian forces involved in the battle of Mariupol are likely heavily damaged and Ukrainian forces succeeded in tying down and degrading a substantial Russian force.

Russian forces continued offensive operations in eastern Ukraine but made only marginal gains.

It would not be difficult for Taiwan to conquer these objections. Unequivocal assertion of separation is a unilateral action. Recognition as a State distinct from China could be done by any of Taiwan's many diplomatic relations. If both things happen, Taiwan is a state for Crawford, since his primary criteria for statehood is effectiveness and he explicitly lists Taiwan as having effectiveness.

I grant that I omitted the second half, but it also seems a low bar for Taiwan to meet.

&gt; The one thing to note is that 2 criteria then was laid down, ""provided that the local entity was effectively independent,"" and ""the military opposition of the metropolitan State had to all intents and purposes ceased.""

This section of the book is historical. Crawford is reviewing previous modes of recognition. This is a 19th century understanding of state formation under discussion, a liberalization of the previous theory that succession could only create a state with the recognition of the metropolitan state.

&gt;And when you say ""more conservative constitutive interpretation of statehood"" you have to define that.
&gt; 
&gt;Because we are disagreeing on the basic definitions.

Under constitutive statehood, an entity becomes a state if, and only if, it is recognized as such by another state. Under declaratory statehood, whether other states recognize the entity is irrelevant; what matters is the capacity of the entity to effectively behave as a state.

The article details the rapid build up of the Chinese bases, but it was the three different strategies of other Asian powers in response to the Chinese build up that I found interesting.

Quote from the article:

&gt; Thus, one by one, countries across the Asia-Pacific have come to reassess their needs for military bases. The types of bases built since the late 2000s signal three distinct strategies.

&gt; First is a strategy of limited deterrence, the intent of which is to prevent Chinese forces from operating with complete impunity, rather than to thwart them.

https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/israel-s-next-war-we-ain-t-seen-nothing-yet-1.5464311

The article you provided was also written in 2014 when the Gaza War was still on-going, when the Iron Dome's effectiveness was more influential, **it was** particularly bad in 2012.

&gt;Scaling the damage rates relative to warhead weight can adjust for these differences. The damage claims per “standardized” rocket then become 4.4, 3.9, 4.3, and 1.5, respectively. The first three numbers’ closeness suggests Iron Dome had minimal influence in 2012. But the subsequent large drop implies it was very influential in 2014.

&gt;[...] It suggests Iron Dome intercepted 59 to 75 per cent of all threatening rockets during Protective Edge four years ago. “Threatening” means the rockets struck populated areas or were intercepted beforehand. The interceptions likely avoided $42 to $86 million in property damage. They also prevented three to six deaths and 120 to 250 injuries.

&gt;Those percentages include rockets anywhere in Israel. Therefore, the claim of a 92 per cent interception rate for only the areas defended by Iron Dome seems plausible.

&gt;By contrast, the 2012 Pillar of Defense interceptions apparently blocked less than 32 per cent of threatening rockets. They prevented at most two deaths, 110 injuries and US$7 million in damage.

You are going to have to demonstrate that. The following are directed quotations.

*It has been seen that the classical criteria for statehood (the so-called ‘Montevideo criteria’) were essentially based on the principle of effectiveness. The proposition that statehood is a question of fact derives strong support from the equation of effectiveness with statehood. Even if effectiveness was conceded to be a legal requirement—and not simply a self-evident fact—it was generally denied that there exist (or even that there could exist) criteria for statehood not based on effectiveness. For example according to Charpentier ‘les tentatives de développement de règles de légalité objective détachées de l’effectivité jointes à l’absence de sanctions capables de les faire respecter entraînent fatalement un conﬁt entre le droit et le faitdans lequel celui-là risque de l’emporter, constituant ainsi à lui seul un critère de validation de l’extension illégale des compétences.’*

*In the ﬁrst place it is necessary to distinguish two possible positions: that there cannot a priori be any criteria for statehood independent of effectiveness, and that no such criteria yet exist as a matter of international law. If the former position is correct there can be no inquiry into the effect of particular rules on statehood. But, clearly, effective entities have existed that have been widely or even universally held not to be States—for example, Rhodesia, Taiwan and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Conversely, non-effective entities have been regarded as continuing to be States: for example, the various entities unlawfully annexed in the period 1936 to 1940 (Ethiopia, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Baltic States), Guinea-Bissau before Portuguese recognition or Kuwait in the period 1990 to 1991. The proposition that statehood must necessarily be equated with effectiveness is not supported by this practice. Nonetheless, various arguments have been made in support of that view.*

*First it is argued that to apply rules of this type in the absence of an authoritative system of determination of status is impractical. Since there will be no certainty as to the application of peremptory rules in this situation in the absence of some form of collective recognition, no such rules can be accepted. This is a variant of an argument that is central to the constitutive position and that has been discussed in Chapter 1. No compulsory procedure for determining disputed questions exists in most ﬁelds of international law and the view that statehood is, exceptionally, a matter requiring such certiﬁcation cannot be accepted: why should the normal modes of international law-making and application cease to apply in this ﬁeld? Anyway the uncertainties can easily be exaggerated: the international legal status of most States most of the time is not in dispute, just like the existence of most treaties most of the time. ‘Collectivization’ of recognition may be desirable, but since 1945 there has developed through admission to the United Nations and in other ways a process of certiﬁcation that has fulﬁlled the function of certiﬁcation, without the attribute of a priori certainty that constitutive theorists vainly seek.*

....



*The ofﬁcial response of the government of Taiwan to the Anti-secession Law included the statement that, ‘based on the Montevideo Convention of 1933...it is undeniable that the Republic of China is a sovereign and independent state.’ According to the ofﬁcial response, the Chinese law ‘infringes upon the sovereignty of the Republic of China.’...As with earlier statements, these, while reiterating the separateness of Taiwan as a self-governing unit, do not contain a declaration of independence from China. The government in Taiwan continues to characterize itself as the ‘Republic of China’ and to stress its continuity, while increasingly practising discontinuity. It is still the case that Taiwan has not unequivocally declared its independence from China. It is still the case that there is no general international recognition of Taiwan as a separate State.*

*The conclusion must be that Taiwan is not a State because it still has not unequivocally asserted its separation from China and is not recognized as a State distinct from China. Its origins as a consolidated local de facto government in a civil war situation continue to affect it. But this does not mean that Taiwan has no status whatever in international law. Courts faced with speciﬁc issues concerning its status may treat it on a de facto basis as a ‘well deﬁned geographical, social, and political entity [with]...a Government which has undisputed control of the island’*


&gt;Speaking specifically of Taiwan, all that would be required to satisfy Crawford as to its statehood is its unequivocal assertion of separation from China. No treaty with China, or anyone else, would be required.

Quote him. 

&gt;This doesn't address state creation. This is a piece of a different and much more complicated issue -- what is the legal status of Taiwan?

Actually, it does. Because no state was created. That's my point. There was no new state, just two warring governments. 


&gt;The US met the Montevideo criteria in 1776.

I have quoted his opinion on the Montevideo criteria.

&gt;Under the more conservative constitutive interpretation of statehood, the US would be considered a state in 1778, when it was recognized by France. As the Treaty of Paris was signed in 1783, it cannot be the founding document.

The founding documents has nothing to do with an entity entering into the person of state. 

And when you say ""more conservative constitutive interpretation of statehood"" you have to define that.

Because we are disagreeing on the basic definitions. 

I think the distinction is more like when the US recognized former Spanish colonies who resisted the Spanish attempt and defended their independence, "" 'To continue to call that a possession of Spain, in which all Spanish occupation and power had been actually extinguished and effaced, could render no practical service to the Mother country' "", as Crawford quotes Canning, further elaborating

*Canning’s distinction between de jure and diplomatic recognition and his application of it to the Spanish-American colonies are signiﬁcant. It has been suggested that his third description of recognition—that relating to the ‘question of right’ between the belligerents—is equivalent to modern de jure recognition, but it is clear that this was and is not so: rather this recognition ‘of right’ reﬂected the then inﬂuential principle of legitimacy, in a sense the successor to Pufendorf’s principle of allegiance. No international legal consequences—at least so far as third States were concerned—were to be deduced from the failure of metropolitan recognition, provided that the local entity was effectively independent, and the military opposition of the metropolitan State had to all intents and purposes ceased.*


The one thing to note is that 2 criteria then was laid down, ""provided that the local entity was effectively independent,"" and ""the military opposition of the metropolitan State had to all intents and purposes ceased."" 

You aren't independent when you declare it, you are independent when you have effectively defeated the other claimant. 

In case of Taiwan, as I have stated, unless you have answered these 2 fundamental questions from the Chinese and convinced them for a peaceful resolution, Taiwan isn't going to be an independent state unless they win a war of independence.",70296fce086b2350717591b935a6e2f756fc68f5,True,False,,,,,0,1650578522,,0,{},i5o92tb,False,t3_u7ixz8,False,True,t1_i5nu9ww,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u7ixz8/chinas_grand_strategy_dr_mastro_of_stanford/i5o92tb/,1650578536,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650549722.0,

Take this paper. It's not a real study, it's a shared assignment for a Navy Postgrad school that three Army majors attended and co-wrote together. It's like a freshman in college writing a 1000 word essay on why skateboards are cool, he only picked a subject he knows a little about, is enthusiastic about, to complete a writing assignment for school.

Marksmanship training is abysmal in the Army in particular (Marines is better but not my much) largely due to funding issues, apathy amongst officers (who are mostly more ignorant on the subject than junior enlisted), lack of live fire training opportunities, lack of qualified trainers (especially Army), etc.

I toyed around with the idea of ""why don't they improve it?"" and ultimately it came down to even if they fixed everything else the turnover was high enough to not make it work.

When it comes to the infantry rifle squad it's a young force, with the trigger pullers mostly being E1-E4 serving a single 3-4 year enlistment, with a disturbing number who don't finish their enlistment due to injuries, admin discharges for bad conduct, injuries, mental disorders, etc. 

Team leaders generally have 2-5 years experience and squad leaders have 4-8 years (though now way more in the USMC). But SL in particular aren't supposed to be shooting, their job is mostly command and control, coordination, supervision of team leaders, etc. Team leaders shoot more since they have a ""follow me"" job description but they're still supposed to be controlling their team's fire more than firing, or else fire control/discipline suffers (very common in GWOT).

Advanced training is a good investment for SOCOM because their selection keeps most of the shirbirds out, they have great retention where individuals try to stay as trigger pullers as long as possible well into senior NCO ranks, and because officers are better and they give more power to more knowledgeable NCOs. 

However, all that said, the stuff I'm talking about isnt that much more expensive or time consuming than what we're doing now. It's just more updated, tweaked a bit for better optimization, a few tech items to greatly help that are cheap or already in the supply system, etc. All it requires is giving a shit.

Let me recommend ""The Tragedy of Great Power Politics"" by John Mearsheimer. His core thesis is that a world hegemony is impractical because oceans limit power projection. So America has an easy time establishing hegemony in the west, but cannot practically do so in the east.

He gives the example of 19th century UK action on the continent. The UK was the dominant power of the time, but did not opt to conquer Europe. That would have been expensive and inefficient, owing to the water problem. However, water works both ways, enabling the UK to act as an offshore balancer with extremely little risk of invasion in response to their balancing actions on the continent. So, offshore balancing is the cheap, efficient method of preserving primacy, allowing the UK to prioritize gains in other regions with weaker opposition.

Turning back to your question, the threat is that China will establish a regional hegemony in the east, which America will not be able to contest due to the power of water to block force projection. If China is able to consolidate regional hegemony, East Asia is a stronger region than America, which will lead to a reshaping of the international order in unfavorable ways for America. So Mearsheimer argues that America should form a balancing coalition in the east, with the aim of preventing China from achieving primacy.

&gt; That we interpret something as being not in our (western) interest does not make it hostile, even if it's convenient to portray it as such. Hegemonies rise and fall.

If you are the hegemon, you don't think this way. It's not ""easy come, easy go"". Great power politics is zero sum. Any action that disadvantages the hegemon is hostile to the hegemon.",d9754c8e6d8d2c261732288afeb7b483bbafbb78,True,False,,,,,0,1650577820,,0,{},i5o7hdh,False,t3_u8cu2e,False,False,t1_i5lkcq5,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u8cu2e/solomon_islandschina_deal_australias_leaders/i5o7hdh/,1650577834,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650549020.0,

Insurance records show how much damaged happened. Comparing before and after the introduction of the Iron Dome does not seem to  indicate a high level of success.

An MIT professor

&gt;The Israeli government publishes insurance claim data that occur during different time periods. This data would very clearly show a reduction in ground damage in the areas defended by Iron Dome. This could not be otherwise, given the large number of successful intercepts being claimed by the Israelis and the significant reduction in damage that would occur from destroying artillery rocket warheads that would otherwise explode on the ground, or in or near buildings.

[],False,,OhSillyDays,,,[],,,,text,t2_h1c0qtwi,False,False,"All good points. Here are my thoughts on it. 

&gt; 1) the new fancy 6.5 cartridges simply don't offer a significant enough increase in performance to justify retooling and replacing the gear for the entire US military. The M4 and other AR-15/18 derivatives are good enough that unless there is a significant technological development, any replacement isn't going to offer enough of a benefit especially when the 5.56 cartridge already is sufficient in the majority of cases.

It's actually not that expensive compared to training. A typical m4 costs somewhere around $1000, and the US military has maybe a million of them. That's a billion dollars. Each soldier training probably eats 10000 rounds. That easily takes out $10k. Not to mention food, salary, range, etc. The biggest cost would be retraining the troops on a new platform, not the platform. 

&gt; Considering that the Army has been sourcing data and trialing infantry small arms for decades now and the M4 and HK 416 are still being purchased, it would take a pretty significant improvement to knock 5.56 out. However, basically any significant improvement that the AR-15 platform can't take advantage will result in an replacement for the weapon and its ammo.

Armor seems to be the big reason for the bigger caliber. 5.56 is just insufficient against armor, even at close range. 

&gt; 2) you mentioned 700m+shooting, data still has the majority of engagement at 300m and and those extremely long range engagements were an outlier, mostly in Afghanistan. Sure some 6.5 can be point accurate at that range but the bigger concern is actually seeing and hitting the target, generally the rule of thumb (as was taught to me) is +1x for every 100m (4x at 400) and I don't know any widely issued 6x+ scopes on infantry guns in fact that was about when 1x red dots started being used. And if Afghanistan didn't make the military upgrade the standard optic then they definitely did not believe those ranges were anything other than outliers and the higher caliber guns in the squad or platoon were sufficient along with 5.56's sufficient accuracy for suppression and massed area targeting.

First, you aren't fighting yesterday's war, you are designing weapons today for tomorrows war. Which is likely to be an urban environment. Combatants are likely to be wearing body armor. 

Second, if you are going to build a weapon that is good at going through armor, you'll have a caliber better for long range shooting. At that point, it's probably a good idea to take advantage of that advantage. 

Three, Modern LPVO scopes can do 1-6x or 1-10X pretty easily. And changing the zoom is extremely easy - a big knob. Granted, it would take more training, but I don't see them as nearly as bad as they used to be. And they are testing out those scopes on the next generation weapon. 

Four, the addition of thermals and night vision or two reasons to add the extra distance. They may make it easier to acquire targets at the longer distances. 

&gt; 3)a general use cartridge that works for LMGs, SAWs and standard infantry rifles has been desired and attempted for many decades, but has never been successful long term, what significant developments has happened that makes the new 6.5 cartridges the answer to replace 7.62nato and 5.56 in general use? The USMC is currently attempting to blur out the SAW by making their infantry more suppression fire capable with their new M27 IAR (a heavy barrel HK 416 IIRC) in 5.56.

I personally don't think we should do away with 5.56. It still has a very good niche for carrying a lot of ammo. Especially for close quarters fights where volume is more important than accuracy or armor piercing. Especially for suppressing fire. 7.62 has lost a lot of favor though. 

If you look up at my post, I gave 5 reasons why advancements in technology means a new cartridge would be better than 5.56 or 7.62. 

&gt; 4)as an alternative to a full change to 6.5 why not simply update the m85 ball standard to something like one of the higher powered 70gr 5. 56 loadings on the market and get most of the difference without requiring a massive change to the weapon systems currently in use?

The problem is again the armor. 70g or even 77g is not nearly enough to get through body armor. Going to a 6.5 or 6.8 would essentially double the amount of energy in the bullet throughout the trajectory. Even against a heavy 75g 5.56. And having a 6.5 or 6.8 could do away with 7.62, as long as you carried .338/12.7mm for the really long range requirements. 

&gt; 5)6.5 Grendel is a higher power intermediate cartridge that could replace the 5.56 but considering that it is wider and higher recoiling, is the increase in range and body armor penetration worth the loss in magazine capacity (25 vs 30 rounds) and 5.56's capacity for quick follow up shots? 6.5 creedmore being much closer to 7.62nato would be an even more extreme trade off. One of the most important properties of assault rifle doctrine is extremely rapid follow up shots allowing a middling shooter to ""walk"" their shots onto target, is extra range and armor penetration worth trading that away to varying degrees?

That's a good question. I'm not sure. It seems the military is changing doctrine to ""less volume, more precision, more training, better equipment."" And ""walking"" in the shots isn't needed if you have better training with better optics.",3698eae57af9b62f63bfcd7dece0fd16601624dc,True,False,,,,,0,1650576942,,0,{},i5o5gka,False,t3_u8p84n,False,True,t1_i5nu3jl,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u8p84n/effectiveness_of_the_individual_riflemen_in_an/i5o5gka/,1650576963,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650548142.0,

Original mission was strictly anti-personnel

&gt;In May 2012, the United States Marine Corps began ordering Switchblades to allow troops to strike improvised explosive device (IED) emplacement teams and similar targets. Usually when air support is called in, attackers slip away before a large UAV, attack helicopter, fighter-bomber, or quick reaction force can arrive on station. Marines sometimes couldn't get support due to other units getting mission priority. 

and it was designed that way....

&gt;The warhead is specifically designed for controlled firepower to reduce collateral damage through a focused blast. It has a forward-firing shotgun-blast effect rather than a 360-degree blast, throwing pellets in the direction that the missile is traveling. 

So... a shotgun of shrapnel blasted out the front of the drone a set amount of feet from impact.

I'm not sure Ukraine needs that as much as ""some vehicle penetration thrown out the front of the drone"" a set amount of feet from impact.

You'd also have to wonder how much investment/planning went into it and whether or not the North Koreans put on their thinking caps and came to the conclusion that this artillery network was going to last about as long as it took the US to carpet bomb it or even nuke it once it started firing, and that stocking more than a dozen shells per gun was a waste of resources better spent on planes or missiles.

Something that stood out to me from the press releases on Sig Sauer and TrueVelocity's entries was that each apparently managed to reach 3000 ft/sec for a 135 grain projectile, but TrueVelocity's required a longer barrel. Excerpt from [this assessment](https://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/ngsw-apples-and-oranges-sig-sauers-277-sig-fury-vs-true-velocitys-6-8tvc/):

&gt; But that’s not where the differences end. If you look at the SAAMI spec sheets, you see that the 277 SIG Fury round achieved its certified performance from a 16-inch barrel. The 6.8TVC was certified using a 24-inch barrel (that’s not easy to see…you have to look at the bottom of the second velocity and test pressure page). The True Velocity web site indicates that the 6.8TVC round’s “ballistic data and specifications are currently confidential.”

Wikipedia's entry on [7.62x51mm NATO rounds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.62%C3%9751mm_NATO) claims 2800 ft/s for a 147 grain bullet. Considering kinetic energy would be 0.5 * (mass) * (velocity)^2, it seems from a back of the envelope calculation that the 6.8mm bullets should actually have more kinetic energy than the current 7.62 bullets- the mass is lower by a factor of (135)/(147) but the speed is faster by 15/14, for an overall ratio of (135)/(147)*(15/14)^2 = 1.05.

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"&gt;most half competent riflemen will probably be budget snipers at 500 meters

Define half confident. Technology doesn't solve the principles of marksmanship.

Think about the standard US Army rifle qualification. 25-300 meters, all inside the maximum point-blank range using a 300 meter zero that all those qualifying will just have confirmed immediately before qualifying. Judging by target size, minus hurricane force winds if they aim center mass they should hit every single target, 40/40. And yet the Army (including infantry) struggles with just qualifying with 25/50 hits, let alone perfect scores. Because point and click isn't how marksmanship works.

NGSW carbine and optic theoretically does all that, for longer longer ranges. It has a flatter shooting cartridge less affected by wind. It tells the shooter the range, cross referencing that with a ballistic computer that compares the known external ballistic math versus the density altitude (a mix of alt, temp, air pressure), possibly even wind (though there is no what that'll be accurate) to give the shooter a corrected aiming point, say at 500 meters. At which point they miss with nearly every shot.

Why? Because their positions suck. Their breathing sucks. Their trigger control sucks. Their sight alignment sucks. Etc. And that's on a flat range where they're not under stress besides time and they're given every encouragement to focus on accuracy. Nothing at all like combat where 99 out a 100 times the shooter doesn't even attempt to use the fundamentals because they're under stress, not thinking, not caring, not focused, not supervised, etc. 

The senior brass involved in NGSW went out of their way during the process talking up how they wanted to basically copy the M1 Abrams. They wanted max pressures. They wanted that badass fire control that tells you where to aim. They wanted a tech solution to fix the problems caused by poor training. But they skipped the key factors that make tank guns actually accurate. One, the guns are mounted to hydraulic recoil mechanisms that return them to the exact same position between shots. Two, they have stabilizing equipment so the gun doesn't move, every shot regardless of tank position or movement is like a rifleman's perfect front and rear sandbag supported prone without worrying about breathing for every shot. NGSW doesn't gain that, so they're still going to miss aplenty, but now using ungodly expensive rifle, scope, and ammo combo to do their missing.",988087e71ea81938240d6ff120834a0241d0ef50,True,False,,,,,0,1650573212,,0,{},i5nwfe5,False,t3_u8p84n,False,True,t1_i5nmuvt,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u8p84n/effectiveness_of_the_individual_riflemen_in_an/i5nwfe5/,1650573226,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650544412.0,

This is pure speculation on my part....

But I wonder if these are Switchblade 100's with a change to the explosive payload such that they can easily take out an artillery piece.

The original 100 has an anti-personnel charge ""equivalent to a 40mm grenade"". That suggests to me a relatively small charge with lots of shrapnel. They were designed to be anti-personnel primarily....and maybe take out *very* light vehicles (like a truck) at a push.

Ukraine needs to take out artillery pieces and I don't think a 40mm anti-personnel grenade would reliably do so.

OTOH, if you took that anti-personnel charge OUT..... then I suspect that would leave enough room/weight for another similar charge designed to ""crack an artillery piece"" if it hit. Essentially replacing the ""small charge+shrapnel"" of an anti-personnel round with a ""small shaped charge"" or ""explosive+thermite"" or even just ""more explosive"".

This would fit the parameters we've been told about so far of ""tailoring switchblades to be specific to Ukraines needs"" and ""designed to deliver a punch"" and ""able to be used by switchblade trined operators with minimal additional training"". 

It'd also explain the extremely rapid development and ability to deploy.

I am. If it helps, consider that I believe American support of Taiwan is considerably more oppositional than mere diplomatic pressure would be.

&gt;The US was in an informal alliance from the Chinese invasion of Vietnam till the Tiananmen Sq. They didn't care about a liberal China. They didn't care about a unified China.

The foreign policy orthodoxy in America from Reagan until Obama was that economic growth would lead to increasing liberalism in China, and that liberalizing China was an explicit policy objective. Lots of quotes from Presidents to that effect [here](https://www.aei.org/articles/president-since-reagan-wrong-china/).

&gt;Then I recommend reading some books on it. Laws are bizarre. Perhaps the ""The Creation of States in International Law"" by Crawford.

As I recall, Crawford holds with Montevideo, which is a model of declaratory statehood. Neither treaty nor recognition by other states is required under Montevideo. Speaking specifically of Taiwan, all that would be required to satisfy Crawford as to its statehood is its unequivocal assertion of separation from China. No treaty with China, or anyone else, would be required.

&gt;The cession of territory at the end of a war must await the peace treaty, and this may be the case even though the terms of treaty have been in part pre-arranged in binding form between belligerents. In other words the peace treaty could have ceded Taiwan to no other than the State of China: the problem was that, in 1951, there was no agreement to which government represented that State.

This doesn't address state creation. This is a piece of a different and much more complicated issue -- what is the legal status of Taiwan?

&gt;A unilateral declaration doesn't mean jack. The Treaty of Paris (and winning the Revolutionary War) was what created the US.

The US met the Montevideo criteria in 1776. Under the more conservative constitutive interpretation of statehood, the US would be considered a state in 1778, when it was recognized by France.

[],False,,mifter123,,,[],,,,text,t2_83jtb,False,True,"A couple of thoughts, in no particular order.

1) the new fancy 6.5 cartridges simply don't offer a significant enough increase in performance to justify retooling and replacing the gear for the entire US military. The M4 and other AR-15/18 derivatives are good enough that unless there is a significant technological development, any replacement isn't going to offer enough of a benefit especially when the 5.56 cartridge already is sufficient in the majority of cases. 

Considering that the Army has been sourcing data and trialing infantry small arms for decades now and the M4 and HK 416 are still being purchased, it would take a pretty significant improvement to knock 5.56 out. However, basically any significant improvement that the AR-15 platform can't take advantage will result in an replacement for the weapon and its ammo. 

2) you mentioned 700m+shooting, data still has the majority of engagement at 300m and and those extremely long range engagements were an outlier, mostly in Afghanistan. Sure some 6.5 can be point accurate at that range but the bigger concern is actually seeing and hitting the target, generally the rule of thumb (as was taught to me) is +1x for every 100m (4x at 400) and I don't know any widely issued 6x+ scopes on infantry guns in fact that was about when 1x red dots started being used. And if Afghanistan didn't make the military upgrade the standard optic then they definitely did not believe those ranges were anything other than outliers and the higher caliber guns in the squad or platoon were sufficient along with 5.56's sufficient accuracy for suppression and massed area targeting.

3)a general use cartridge that works for  LMGs, SAWs and standard infantry rifles has been desired and attempted for many decades, but has never been successful long term, what significant developments has happened that makes the new 6.5 cartridges the answer to replace 7.62nato and 5.56 in general use? The USMC is currently attempting to blur out the SAW by making their infantry more suppression fire capable with their new M27 IAR (a heavy barrel HK 416 IIRC) in 5.56.

4)as an alternative to a full change to 6.5 why not simply update the m85 ball standard to something like one of the higher powered 70gr 5. 56 loadings on the market and get most of the difference without requiring a massive change to the weapon systems currently in use?

5)6.5 Grendel is a higher power intermediate cartridge that could replace the 5.56 but considering that it is wider and higher recoiling, is the increase in range and body armor penetration worth the loss in magazine capacity (25 vs 30 rounds) and 5.56's capacity for quick follow up shots? 6.5 creedmore being much closer to 7.62nato would be an even more extreme trade off.

&gt;I would say so. Modern ATGMs can be operated by a single soldier or remotely. AT guns required a crew of 5 and the powerful ones like the Pak 43 were enormous. 

And now we're right back to you talking about dismounted ATGM, which are still a crew served weapon and ignoring that the ranges you just brought up last paragraph were ATGM fired by AFV requiring a minimum of crew of three, have much less ammo, cost way more. 

&gt;But those had a range of 1.5 to 2km and were manually guided. You are not engaging a target 5km away with a 30mm cannon. Not even with a tank cannon.

&gt;if NATO adopts a policy which envisions expansion into Central and Eastern Europe **without holding the door open to Russia,** it would be universally interpreted in Moscow as directed against Russia and Russian alone – or ‘neo-containment’….”

PfP was that door. Russia rejected it, on the basis of ""specious"" claims about western assurances. I think one inference from the documents, somewhat unsurprisingly since they were referencing ongoing negotiations, was that the positions of **both** parties were highly fluid, with Russia bouncing back and forth between being ok with NATO expansion and vehemently opposing it and western countries shifting around the rate and breadth of any expansion. We don't see much from former Soviet bloc countries in the documents outside the Polish quote I referenced, but I don't think any discussion about this topic is really complete without factoring in their views, which goes back to my second point. Would they have joined PfP if they didn't get a quick path to NATO to solidify their independence? I think it's clear, and understandable, that they would like to see a form of ""neo containment"" at least until there was a post soviet Russia they could trust to not attempt their imperial ambitions again. If it was a choice between ""anchoring Russia in the west"" or assuring those post Soviet states their sovereignty and independence would be upheld, what would the correct decision have been?

Of course, this all assume that it would have even been *possible* to ""anchor"" Russia in the west given its domestic political situation at the time. Many of the Russian documents in the link seem to imply they would view most of the ways one would define that would also be viewed as relinquishing power and being ""subservient to a single capital."" Radchenko even acknowledges this with

&gt;This was first and foremost Russia’s failure: the Russians did not have enough foresight, perseverance, and goodwill to break free from the legacy of imperialism and authoritarianism.

Yet somehow the west ""failed to find sufficient space for Russia in the relevant economic and security structures."" The questions really are did NATO expansion actually limit that space, and how much space should you really give a country with such a legacy of authoritarianism and imperialism? The countries with the most experience with that legacy were desperate to become part of NATO, which goes a long way towards answering the second question at least.

Really what amount of space could even a post Soviet Russia be trusted with? The empire collapsed due more to circumstances forced on it rather than any sort of major desire to change political systems or its approach to governance or geopolitics. If expanding NATO as it happened was a mistake, it's such a minor issue in comparison to Russia's inability to reject authoritarianism and imperialism that even discussing it as a factor in today's geopolitical situation feels fairly disingenuous. Without some sort of clear, concrete, and causal connection to negative outcomes I have a hard time coming to the conclusion that how NATO expanded in the 90's was a ""mistake.""

[],False,,Ok_Use4737,,,[],,,,text,t2_2uxmb935,False,False,"From what I've read, alot of this had to do with US troops getting into regular firefights at 600+ meters in Iraq and mostly Afghanistan. While I'm not sure that trend will hold in our next military action, militaries world over are starting to field optics over iron sights on their weapons as they become more reliable. So longer engagement lengths are likely to become the norm, terrain allowing, with opponents fielding at least some kind of body armor. Punching through body armor at 50 meters isn't that hard, in fact the 5.56 does pretty good here because of it's high speed and small diameter. But doing it at 300+ meters is a different story.

The 5.56 isn't really known for it's performance at long range, accuracy or penetrating power, mostly because is just a lighter weight bullet and can't carry the energy. AP tech for rifle bullets isn't likely to improve much more than it already has. Not without making ammunition unaffordable and probably explosive in some way. The 6.8mm is pretty much the sweet spot for non magnum cartridges. I would guess the new round out performs both the 7.62 NATO and 5.56 NATO at range. Being able to use the same bullet in your squad automatics plus standard rifle has it's own benefits.

I'm a little surprised the bullpup didn't win, but there is something to be said for the Military not wanting to change to drastically from what it knows and trusts. And for good reason. I thought the plastic cartridges were pretty revolutionary, but I can see some general in his 60's saying F\*\*\* that just because it was plastic and he still has nightmares from his first time holding a first gen M16 jamomatic. We have no idea how these guns performed when field tested or what kind of problems that plastic ammo  brought to the table.

We'll see how the high chamber pressures effect things, but I think they did pretty exhaustive torture tests. If they were able to solve the head separation and extraction problems that come with high pressures by using the stainless head ... who am I to say it's not fine. Chamber pressures have been slowly creeping upwards since the 5.56 and 7.62 NATO were fielded. 80,000 is pretty high, but call me cautiously optimistic. 

Both rifles looked pretty ergonomical. I got the impression they both worked hard to get alot of input from soldiers and did iterative design accordingly. Sig's design and size isn't really much different than the military's current M4's. A little heavier, but its also firing a bigger bullet, so that's unavoidable to some extent. Recoil will defiantly be the new exciting thing for grunts to bitch about. But they'll get used to it and be just fine. And most will probably secretly be pleased their rifle has better knockdown power. I would guess recoil will be less than the 7.62 NATO overall.

Assuming 1 MOA accuracy and a 1-8x scope that automagically gives you a holdover dot for range and different windage values, most half competent riflemen will probably be budget snipers at 500 meters. Good riflemen WILL be snipers...

Personally I don't care about keeping Crimea much, so I would actually organise a proper and legitimate referendum with HEAVY western observation. I would actually like  the vote counts to be done by as much internationals with as much neutrality as possible.

There would be two options: to once again become an autonomous region of Ukraine as it was pre-2014 OR to become an independent NEUTRAL nation with no standing army (a la Costa-Rica) with a constitutional ban on any foreign military presence. Complete demilitarisation of the peninsula (UN peacekeepers could be an exception if that can help the process), so even if independentists win they can simp for russia all they want without any threat to Ukraine. 

The referendum should follow two rules which while not completely democratic are in my opinion fair: 1) Only residents (no matter their current passport) that were registered by ukrainian authorities in January 2014 are allowed to vote (thus eliminating all the non-local russian settler bias) and 2) Only ages 21-65 are allowed to vote (because I believe the elderly have no say in questions deciding the fate of the younger generations).

The referendum should not only be held in Crimea, but wherever there is a prominent number of relocated Crimeans that are eligible by the first rule. Russian territory wouldn't be an exception, but you can't trust russians could allow honest democratic procedures to happen on their soil.

&gt;

That is simply not true. A good tank doing berm drills will be up and down in 3 seconds. If you are 2km out, no SALCOS ATGM will reach before that tank is down. This also doesn't account for soft-kill APS like some which can fool even F&amp;F ATGMs.


&gt;ATGMs also massively outrange tank guns, so tank would have to get a lot closer to effectively engage.
&gt;

The newest 120mm rounds for the US can go beyond 4k vs AFVs, probably the same for infantry. The idea of a large caliber gun not being able to go long distances is absurd, it's literally all artillery is. 

&gt;This is just not going to happen. The only way tank would fight other tank in the future would be with ATGMs.
&gt;

Or because terrain forces you closes than several kms, at which point you'll want that passive armor again. 

Imagine a tank crests a berm, and 1000m out is spotted by an IFV. The IFV shoots and ATGM, the tank fires it's shell and pops smoke. The missile will miss, but that tank round is still hitting. 

&gt;&gt; once the Atgms are expended and possibly defeated by the APS
&gt;

Tanks can have APS too.

&gt;You need to resupply that just like you need to resupply ammo, fuel, food, spare parts etc. Armies depend on logistics.
&gt;

Or you can still push forward, because your lightly armored IFV is still threated artillery far more, autocannons far more, and even 40mm grenades far more. A modern tank is not nearly as threated by these.

&gt;&gt; A big caliber gun can shoot trough hard cover, plus tanks are capable of putting a relatively big amount of high caliber shells in quick succession

2. The general failure to show any major victories after ~3 months of the offensive will distance the population from rallying around a declaration of war - Russians have already realized it's a meatgrinder. 

3. Taking into account the above points, declaring general mobilization simply gets tougher to reasonably position and as more time passes - the chances it will do major damage to the regime will increase.

Precision standoff munitions and highly integrated sensor networks.  Really, it's a trick question though, because the US is likely the only country with a credible ""one click, one kill"" capability against anything with a radar return or heat signature.  So if your goal is to be a uniformed military attempting an armored assault against emplaced US defenses, then you might as well go back to horses, because they will be more more difficult to target from 100 miles away.  
  
For the US against a near peer, it's a bit different because I don't think anyone has quite the same level of battlefield omnipotence or integrated kill chains, or stealth sensor platforms going on.  In that case, it's less about the death of the ""tank"" and more about the death of direct-fire ""dumb"" munitions, because I'd still rather have my armor shooting guided munitions at individual targets to whatever extent possible.",32284130623278536df020f28f80740b8c65d872,True,False,,,,,0,1650565760,,0,{},i5ndoin,False,t3_u8lyk7,False,True,t1_i5mxcng,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u8lyk7/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_21_2022/i5ndoin/,1650565777,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650536960.0,

More generally, states often take sides in the civil wars of other states without becoming belligerents. Non-intervention in the internal affairs of others is a Chinese policy, not a global norm.

Do you understand the meaning of sovereignty? Just because you fucked up and intervened in other's affairs when you agree on issues of what is sovereignty doesn't mean it's OK. It just show what a hypocrite you are. American opinions would matter if you join the belligerent. Your actions will make a difference. Your opinion will not.

&gt;I cannot imagine America taking over or puppeting the China of today.

Wasn't my position so I guess we agree.

&gt;It says ROC.

I thought I sort of explained the difference between a nation, a government, and sovereignty.

Just in case I didn't, the phrase stolen from the Chinese indicted who owns it. The Chinese. As I explained but if not, a people is a nation. Now I don't agree with this Chinese nation business but that's how it was agreed upon, so the Chinese is in fact the nation or the sovereign of the state, ie, the Chinese state. It will be retuen to ROC, the legal representation of the Chinese state, ie, the government. As governments cannot hold sovereignty, as sovereignty is those of the sovereign, the Chinese people, the return of Taiwan is not to ROC but the Chinese state whose sovereign are the Chinese, whose property was stolen from.

&gt;I don't think the US is trying to pressure China with Taiwan. The refugee crises in Europe were examples of pressure, where eastern countries were seeking concessions from western ones in exchange for making the refugee problem go away. The US isn't offering to stand aside in Taiwan in exchange for some other concession from China.

You can't be serious. Are you?

&gt;The US of the 80s and 90s was not concerned with containment of China. They defended Taiwan then because they wanted to see a peaceful reunification with a more liberal China. Technically, the US still wants that, but sees it as hopeless.

The US was in an informal alliance from the Chinese invasion of Vietnam till the Tiananmen Sq. They didn't care about a liberal China. They didn't care about a unified China.

&gt;This is the PRC position, but it is not settled international law. In particular, I find the idea that states are formed by treaties is bizarre.

Then I recommend reading some books on it. Laws are bizarre. Perhaps the ""The Creation of States in International Law"" by Crawford.

Let me just quote one passage on the complicated issue.

*The cession of territory at the end of a war must await the peace treaty, and this may be the case even though the terms of treaty have been in part pre-arranged in binding form between belligerents. In other words the peace treaty could have ceded Taiwan to no other than the State of China: the problem was that, in 1951, there was no agreement to which government represented that State.*

This is a complicated issue. It isn't that the law isn't 'settled' but there are disputes on how the law should be applied.

&gt;Treaties are agreements between multiple parties, but a state does not need the agreement of others to exist. For example, there is no treaty that formed the United States; it was a unilateral declaration.

A unilateral declaration doesn't mean jack. The Treaty of Paris (and winning the Revolutionary War) was what created the US.",2f7b26b04003cb027415d9015124eb62ae77db60,True,False,,,,,0,1650563947,,0,{},i5n91t3,False,t3_u7ixz8,False,True,t1_i5luvhm,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u7ixz8/chinas_grand_strategy_dr_mastro_of_stanford/i5n91t3/,1650563966,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650535147.0,

I don't think it's necessary for a round to be able to penetrate heavy body armor. Right now Russia is the only adversary that's really even using heavy body armor and atm Ukraine with just 7.62 AK's seems to be doing just fine. Countries like China, North Korea or any other Middle Eastern country isn't using heavy body armor, at least on the average soldier. 

Instead the U.S. Army should of focused on accuracy and power at longer ranges. If they needed the round to penetrate heavy body armor there are AP rounds they could've developed to do just that. I mean if they're expecting a standard round to punch through body armor what will they expect of an AP round? The ability to punch through lightly armored vehicles? Personally I just think the Army went with a ridiculously high standard of what they expect the average infantryman's rifle should be able to do. 

Not to mention they're not even trying to use new or better technology to do it. They're just brute forcing it with a standard rifle design, reinforcing the ammunition, lowering the number of rounds per magazine to 20 and raising the pressure to ridiculous amounts. There's nothing groundbreaking here. If the Army wants this fantastic rifle with fantastic ammunition they needed to put in the time and money and come out with some fantastic new technology but they didn't. All they did is make a bunch of tradeoffs for a larger round that hits harder. It now has worse handling, worse recoil, more parts wear (even though Sig says otherwise which I think is b.s.) and less ammo per magazine.

Honestly I think they'll end up canceling this program and I personally won't be upset about it. Could you imagine the Army trying to give every soldier a rifle that kicks like a .308 an expecting them to be able to use it efficiently? Imagine a truck driver having to carry around a giant battle rifle that kicks like a horse. True Velocity was the only one I thought had a real chance of replacing every soldiers weapon due to it's bullpup design and lower recoil but the Army once again made a piss poor decision.

This is why it's so important to not completely ignore Eastern European views on the subject. To a degree, yes that interpretation could be considered true, but we're digging down to 1) whether that significantly impacted the trajectory Russia has taken towards the circumstances of today and 2) whether it was the correct course of action or justified. Regarding 1), answering ""yes"" to that question carries with it an assumption that Russian imperial ambitions died with the Soviet Union and eastern European countries did not need security guarantees to feel comfortable in the post Soviet world order. With literal centuries of experience with Russian imperialism and colonialism, I think we need to give eastern Europeans more credit for understanding what a post Soviet Russia might try and achieve, especially as it still contained a powerful ex Soviet establishment that was explicitly imperialist in nature. Given Russia's rejection of the Partnership for Peace initiative, suggesting that another, non NATO, security framework for formerly Soviet eastern European states would have been more accessible or viewed differently is pure speculation IMO. The idea that post Soviet Russia was going to undergo a radical transformation into a western integrated democracy was always a more dubious prospect that people have liked to imagine, especially with how entreched the Soviet establishment remained even after the fall of the USSR both culturally and politically. Much of my point revolves around the fact that pre and post Soviet mindsets in Russia were not as different as we like to think they were, as evidenced by the documentation in your link. The Russians were clearly more interested in still being treated as a great power than they were integrating with the west, even then.

I could see and understand some confusion about western assurances in the negotiations, but that doesn't mean Russian claims of written and legally binding agreements on the matter were being made in good faith. Russia wasn't getting what it wanted in negotiations, so they reverted to Soviet era tactics of simply lying in public statements about what agreements had been made. It's no wonder that at the time western negotiators might start to doubt the wisdom of taking Russian claims or grievances at face value after that as opposed to a continuation of Soviet style ""diplomacy.""

So no, I don't think the NATO expansion was even just a contributing factor to where we are today as it implies Russia changed course as a result of it or there was a real opportunity to mitigate those remaining imperial ambitions by stroking their egos and still treating them like they were still a great power entitled to influence in other sovereign states.

[],False,,OhSillyDays,,,[],,,,text,t2_h1c0qtwi,False,False,"The original design of 5.56 was mostly to create as much firepower for the least amount of weight. And that makes a lot of sense if you are thinking about a battlefield in terms of just sending rounds down range. You'd rather have 1000 small rounds down range rather than 500 big rounds. 

Another aspect of 5.56 is the original designers didn't care so much about the lethality/penetration of the round. That's because in the 70s, pretty much nobody wore body armor. So the need for penetration ability or lethality was pretty low. The military was mostly interested in just hitting an enemy, not killing the enemy. There have been many complaints about the stopping power of 5.56, especially by special forces (many have moved to intermediate calibers, specifically 6.8 SPC). 

The last aspect of 5.56 is the military wanted a round that had similar ballistics to 308. So 5.56 has a very long range. It'll stay supersonic out to 1000 yards. Very few people consider it effective at that range, but for area affect, it certainly is. But after about 500 yards, 5.56 effectiveness drops off. Two major factors, first, it's a light weight bullet so it is heavily affected by wind and, two, it's penetration ability at that distance is minimal. 

The wikipedia article on the round is really really good. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.56%C3%9745mm_NATO#History

After selecting 5.56, the military figured that when there is a need for bigger bullets, you go with 7.62x51. Either with trained marksman with an AR10 derivative (or M14 before that) or a heavy machine gun (m240 or M60). And that has worked since just about Vietnam. 

The problem the military has right now is that 5.56 just isn't big enough to get through common armor. So if you have a hit the target outside of center mass. Which makes 5.56 insufficient now. And enemies have figured out that 5.56 is not effective at 600 yards, so they engage the US military at 700+. 

The main problem with a bigger round is it requires a bigger gun, heavier ammo, and more training to deal with the recoil of a bigger caliber. This is a very big problem with large calibers like 7.62x51. That and the length of 7.62x51 makes the caliber difficult to design a reliable, light-weight guns. A typical AR10 derivative weighs about 10-11lbs (the M110 weighs 13.84 lbs unloaded!!!). A typical M4 weighs 6.5 lbs, and that's before the heavier weight of the ammo. 

There have been a few recent advancements in arms that make going to a bigger caliber possible. 

First, composite ammo is a recent development. The big player in that field is True Velocity. It offers two major advantages, it is lightweight and reduces the heat in the barrel. The heat in the barrel sounds weird, but if you think about brass, getting warm, it'll transfer that heat to the barrel in the headspace. A composite round would offer insulation. Additionally, a well designed composite round could probably soak up some of the heat in form of latent heat (essentially melting a little bit of composite - I'm not sure if true velocity designed this). Additionally, composites are stronger than brass, so the weight can be reduced. True velocity claims a 30% reduction in weight, which is huge. It means 260 rounds weighs the same as 200 rounds. 

Second, optics. Red dots and prisim scopes and LPVOs are fairly recent developments over the last 20-30 years. Prisim scopes saw wide usage in the last 20 years. Mostly because they are simple and increase accuracy with no training. LPVOs are a little more complicated but offer even better increases in accuracy, mostly for long range. But the big advancement is in thermals and night vision optics with laser range finders and dynamic reticles. Thermals and night vision on the gun are obvious in that they help acquiring the target. Laser range finders give you a distance to the target and the scope can compute a firing solution immediately. All the shooter has to do is put the reticle on the target. This can increase the effective range of a rifle out to 600-1000 yards. Now, the military needs a bigger bullet, which brings us to another new recent (ish) development.

Third, intermediate calibers. So 6.5 Swedish has been around FOREVER (originally the 1894). But 6.5 creedmoor got a lot splash because it's new and sexy. 6.5 calibers offer a great thing, high velocity, excellent ballistic coefficients (minimal wind deviations), and light weight. All of which helps with long range shooting. The problem is that they suffer from the same problems of 5.56, stopping power at long distances. They just aren't big bullets, so they tend to have problems with big game. That's why most elk hunters go with 7mm+ sizes. Additionally, the 6.5mm calibers use a high velocity, which wears out barrels pretty quickly (accuracy tends to drop off in 3000 rounds where 7.62 barrels can last 10k+ rounds). 6.8 seems to be a good middle ground between 6.5 caliber and 7mm in that it offers the stopping power and velocity without many of the drawbacks of the 6.5 caliber. 

Four, advances in metallurgy and design of barrels. The peak pressure of a 5.56 is 60k PSI. Having a barrel that can't withstand the pressure means that it'll blow up causing significant injury to the shooter. Not something you want on the battlefield. But higher pressure gives you all around better performance. It's a balancing act. Well, with new technology, the new 6.8x51 used in the newer spec pushed this to 80k PSI. That gives you a higher velocity in a smaller cartridge weight. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.277_Fury

Five, better weapons designs and manufacturing ability. Big calibers offer a big problem, recoil. Managing that recoil was a big reason the military went to 5.56. With the new guns, they manage the recoil by using the barrel as a counter weight (what the M82 barrett does). That works, but requires better manufacturing and design to get it to work properly and to maintain accuracy. Especially in a gun that will get dusty and dirty due to normal usage. 

Six, outside of special operations, the military rarely ""hikes in"" anymore. Weight concerns are still important, but they've become less important as foot mobile soldiers are just not as common in US military doctrine. Most doctrine assumes future wars will be fought in urban combat. For the foot mobile soldiers where weight is important, they can keep using m4/5.56. But it makes sense to move to a slightly larger caliber because probably 3/4 of operations are performed within 100m of Humvees, which can carry thousands of rounds in addition to fire support. 

Put it all together, and it seems like a good time to replace the AR15/5.56 platform with a completely new rifle and cartridge. It offers a new capability for the military compared to the M4. Especially considering the long range capability of a larger caliber.",6f7517af8dd67d6c77b5858fc627f017a5e8e385,True,False,,,,,0,1650561666,,0,{},i5n34tb,False,t3_u8p84n,False,True,t3_u8p84n,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u8p84n/effectiveness_of_the_individual_riflemen_in_an/i5n34tb/,1650561680,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650532866.0,

[],False,,stsk1290,,,[],,,,text,t2_dm5fkye,False,False,"Well, you're quite right about this. Anti tank guns (as well as the vehicles mounting them) could defeat tanks at long range.

That is why armor - beyond what was required to stop small arms - was developed in the first place. It's why armor was concentrated in front, as that's where you'd most likely be taking fire from. Side armor could be thinner, because a tank was unlikely to be hit from a 90° angle. Rear armor was even less important, because if you were shot from behind, something went wrong.

This dynamic between AT guns and tanks led to an arms race, with larger guns being countered by heavier tanks. German medium tanks went from 20t in the beginning of WW2 to 45t at the end. Some types of tanks already became obsolete. Light tanks, which formed the majority of the world's tank armies in the interwar years, could be defeated at any range by light AT guns and were consequently dropped from combat roles.

ATGMs are now doing to all tanks what AT guns did to light tanks. A tanks armor is either insufficient protection against heavy ATGMs or is circumvented by lighter ATGMs.

Moreover, ATGMs improve on AT guns in a whole slew of respects beyond just lethality. They have far more range (4 to 10km vs a maximum of 2km), are much lighter and much easier to conceal. Perhaps most importantly, they are also much cheaper. An ATGM costs between 1% and 3% of a modern tank. A Pak 40 cost between 8% and 15% of a WW2 era medium tank (compared to the Panther and Stug 3).

This actually poses an interesting conundrum. If the development of precision weapons outpaces the development of protection against them, we might see the obsolescence of all kinds of vehicles. We might very well be looking at the return of infantry heavy armies and WW1 style static warfare.",78d9507d1dd2496ad31dcbc64fa9f5240a9b8207,True,False,,,,,0,1650561186,,0,{},i5n1w1j,False,t3_u4wb0r,False,True,t1_i532krr,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u4wb0r/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_16_2022/i5n1w1j/,1650561201,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650532386.0,

This is not an RTS game where units spawn directly near the battlefield. If front-line accounts are accurate, the Ukrainian forces in the JFO may be low on ammo and supplies, particularly as Russia increases the pressure. 

The mistake in mil analysis is a tendency to analyze the macro and assume it extends to the micro - e.g., ""Russia has more troops, therefore they will win."" The issue isn't raw numbers, it's the ability to concentrate forces and supply in the right area and right time to achieve battlefield victory that *translates* into political victory.

[],False,,evo_help93,,,[],,,,text,t2_iul8dbh4,False,False,"While I don't agree with Putin's perspective, I think that NATO (in particular, the USA) viewed the 1980 - 1990 period as the ""new norm"" for the Soviets / Russia: a non-assertive, internally focused power with little appetite for adventurism or assertive foreign policy. This has been proven incorrect - in fact Russia has always had a fairly strong, assertive foreign policy historically, and the post 1990 world is a return to the norm rather than a breach in behaviour.

Putin has three main objectives that (broadly speaking) overlap with much of Russia's foreign policy goals:

1. Preservation of the Putin regime
2. Destruction of American hegemony
3. Reassertion of Russia as a Great Power following the misery and humiliation of the 1990s.

These goals have been tempered / encouraged by events and conditions over the past two decades, but I am confident to say that these have been the central tenets of Putin's leadership. 

Fundamentally, Putin wants Russia to be treated as an *equal* with the USA. This is typically where people scoff and say ""how could they be an equal, their GDP is the size of Italy!"" - as if GDP has a 1:1 correlation with power status or something (cough cough Japan) -  but equality in treatment essentially means their security concerns and national interests are taken *seriously.* 

Recall that Russia did not have much to show for their ""integration"" into the West in the post 1990 world. Russians themselves can take a fair share of the blame for this - but so can the West. I am not interested in playing the blame game: merely to illuminate some of the Russian perspective here. Russia did not benefit to the degree their neighbours did from the post cold war settlement. 

Throughout the early 2000s Putin has seen the fragility and hypocrisy of the ""rules based"" international order. Recall that Russia opposed the intervention of NATO in Yugoslavia (and did so through the UN framework). Russia observed the Iraq War, the US influence in colour revolutions throughout the former USSR, expansion of NATO towards Russias borders, which all influenced *internal politics* in Russia! This is something western analysts continuously ignore: other countries have politics as well and our actions often empower factions that we do not intend (see: US policy vis-a-vis Iran in the 2010s). The post-cold war failure to integrate Russia into the Western economic and security sphere in conjunction with the encroaching erosion of the ""rules based"" order by the US helped fuel the toxic emergence of revanchist politicians in the Kremlin. 

Anyway this is becoming a long post - and as I said, I don't *agree* with much of this worldview - but one cannot deny its existence and we must understand it to counter the Kremlin.",781b259c8cd9e79be45c9307442025ebb303ce9a,True,False,,,,,0,1650559935,,0,{},i5myowu,False,t3_u86qfm,False,True,t1_i5kxxzy,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u86qfm/was_nato_enlargement_a_mistake_foreign_affairs/i5myowu/,1650559949,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650531135.0,

I'm a fully paid up liberal democracy fanboy.... at home.

As far as i can see the ideological crusade (and it IS in effect akin to some zealous holy war) may well be ostensibly justified on a moral basis, but it's consequences are both highly immoral and entirely counterproductive.

The belief that you can just force democracy on the peoples of the world ignores the complexities and nuances of the planets hugely varied cultures. This framing of ourselves as 'the only moral arbiters' also makes war and conflict inevitable... because of course it makes it immoral *not* to invade other countries to enforce our own moral standards.

It's fundamentally flawed, it's never worked, and all that's happened is we've gradually trashed our own liberties and democracy whilst causing the preventable deaths of millions of people.

However, i make a point of trying to hold consistent and principled viewpoints. Seeing the rhetoric and response to russia's awful invasion of ukraine has forced me to completely re-evaluate my views on military action in general, and tbh I just don't know what to think any more.

The main problem with artillery ammo is that [NATO uses 155mm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/155_mm_calibre). Ukraine and Russia [uses Soviet 152mm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/152_mm_towed_gun-howitzer_M1955_(D-20\)). So NATO can't easily supply the ammo Ukraine needs.

&gt; The WW2-era equipment the separatist are always a point of discussion/ laughing stock

Russia could give them something less ridiculous, but chose not to. Their role is presumably mostly to be cannot fodder so Russians get hit less, as there's really not much else they can do.

&gt; The viability and effect of a naval-blockade-in-all-but-name

If NATO wanted to do naval blockade of Russia, like it did to Iraq after it invaded Kuwait, there'd be nothing Russia could do except seethe and cope. But it would have minimal military significance, and there are better economic tools like stop buying Russian oil and gas.

&gt; What does Moskva being the flagships of the black sea fleet entails, is it just a nice looking banner, or does her sinking have any real consequence to Russia's operations?

Not much right now, but if Russian Navy is forced to keep distance, then Ukraine will be able to liberate Crimea, so it might be relevant a few months down the line. Right now it's mostly a prestige hit.

&gt;  Are mechanized infantries who meant to fight along tanks have specific training/ doctrines regarding not impeding the tank's laser senors and APS, vice versa do APS and ERAs have any mechanisms to protect near-by friendly infantry and soft assets?

Globally there's 73k tanks, and about 1% of them have any kind of APS, 99% rely exclusively on passive armor. Even lower % for IFVs etc. So there's not much doctrine for that. We can already tell for sure that tanks with passive protection are useless in modern conflicts, as infantry ATGMs can outrange and destroy them with ease.

We don't know really know what comes next. Some people believe MBT will just add APS and continue pretty much like before. Some people believe that MBTs are basically dead, and the future is much lighter vehicles with APS, much smaller armor, much smaller gun, and ATGMs not gun for anti-tank role. I'm 100% in the second camp, and I think tank enthusiasts are blinded by tanks being cool just like cavalry enthusiasts were, but neither side has any strong evidence yet.

They have plenty (400-500) basic T-72 and T-64 models, hundreds of older heavy artillery pieces (122mm and 152mm, often towed) and mismatched uniforms. Essentially - late 70s and early 80s stuff.

When they launched the sudden mass mobilisation in late February they had no time to request shipments of arms, equipment and uniforms from Russia. Instead, they armed the newly-mobilised troops with what they had in their own depots - meaning even older equipment. Mostly 50s and 60s stuff, including some Mosin-Nagant WW1 vintage sniper rifles.

In other words, these weapons still comes from military depots, but they are leftovers of Russian army leftovers.

I'm a fully paid up liberal democracy fanboy.... at home.

As far as i can see the ideological crusade (and it IS in effect akin to some zealous holy war) may well be ostensibly justified on a moral basis, but it's consequences are both highly immoral and entirely counterproductive.

The belief that you can just force democracy on the peoples of the world ignores the complexities and nuances of the planets hugely varied cultures. This framing of ourselves as 'the only moral arbiters' also makes war and conflict inevitable... because of course it makes it immoral *not* to invade other countries to enforce our own moral standards.

It's fundamentally flawed, it's never worked, and all that's happened is we've gradually trashed our own liberties and democracy whilst causing the preventable deaths of millions of people.

However, If a ceasefire were agreed, Russia would substantiate its fiction that those territories are Russia, and a later Ukraine counterattack would be more likely to trigger a nuclear retaliation since the West's attention would have moved on.

In my opinion, the West should strongly consider Ukraine's position vis-à-vis negotiations (e.g. if Ukraine wants to relinquish territories for Putin's promises). However, the West has its own interests in containing Russia and Ukraine is unlikely to pursue this option.

To seriously answer - step 1 is prevent Russia from being able to gain **any** more ground - we might be coming close to this, and this is the stalemate step.

Step 2 is to retake meaningful land - 

Artillery helps (as does air assault), however Ukranians on multiple fronts are reporting heavy air strikes that prevent them from meaningful advances as they're forced to remain in cover.  What anti-air systems they do have at present seem insufficient to reliably cover any noticeable pushes.  Beyond that, to perform the assaults themselves they'll need at minimum mechanized forces, which require armored vehicles.  Ukraine has some of those but not as many as they'd like.

Did the expansion in the 90's push Russia to where it is today? Would they have given up a centuries old imperialist mindset if the West had been nicer? To my second point, your link summarizes Eastern European views on the matter quite well:

&gt;Polish President Lech Walesa told Clinton (Document 12): “Russia had signed many agreements, but its word was not always good: one hand held a pen; the other a grenade. Yeltsin told the Poles in Warsaw last summer that Russia had no objection to Poland’s membership in NATO; he, Walesa, had a paper with Yeltsin’s signature to prove it. But Yeltsin had changed his mind. [See my second point again]

Overlooked in these conversations is that everyone understood Yeltsin was a weak leader, and there was a barely contained ex-Soviet establishment that viewed itself and Russia in opposition to the west no matter what. NATO didn't cause that mindset to materialize, it was a major factor in the negotiations already in the 90's. Throughout your link you can see from the Russian perspective they were still demanding to be treated as a great power, ignorant of the geopolitical realities that meant they were not. This goes to my first point which was a question even then.

Ultimately Russian bad faith was still a problem during those initial post Soviet negotiations. From your own link:

&gt;The Primakov compilation of Western assurances to Gorbachev may have provided the catalyst for a forceful State Department rebuttal sent to all European posts in February 1996 (Document 23), after then-Ambassador Collins reported that a “senior Kremlin official” was complaining that NATO expansion would violate the “spirit” of the German unification treaty (just as Yeltsin had argued in his September 15, 1993, letter to Clinton). The February 23rd cable transmitted a memo written by Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Europe John Kornblum, together with John Herbst, then at State’s office on the Newly Independent States (NIS) and a future ambassador to Ukraine, characterizing the Russian claims as “specious” and “unfounded.”

Regardless, trying to claim this NATO expansion irrevocably sent Russia on its path to invading previously Soviet territories ignores literal decades of attempted economic and security integration by western countries. Russia was faced with accepting it was no longer a great power and integrating, or resisting and keeping its imperial ambitions alive.

I wanted to better understand what the reasoning was for the change and so I went looking for research. This study is interesting because it tries to use an objective framework to analyze how four different options would perform. 

Of the four options the two that include a new round of intermediate size between 7.62x51 Nato and 5.56x45 Nato, was the winner of most of the circumstances they evaluated.

This study is not definitive and I will try to find more research in the future. If you know of any studies about a new rifle caliber for the military please do submit them to the forum!

-------------

&gt; Our research establishes a decision-making framework for use during the acquisition of the next individual combat rifle system. We utilize four possible courses of action to display the decision-making model. The four primary evaluation factors to optimize the squad are lethality, accuracy, mobility, and interoperability. The first part of the model is a value approach that normalizes these four different performance factors for system comparison. The second part of the model is a qualitative approach that examines other potential risk factors. We analyze, normalize, and weigh the performance factors for comparison of each course of action against programmatic, political, and international risks. Program risks focus on the cost, schedule, and performance of each potential course of action, while maintaining the best interest of our soldiers and American taxpayers. Political risks are uncertain based on the stakeholders involved within Congress and militarys leadership. International risks are primarily concerned with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO. The 5.56mm caliber is the NATO standard, and any adaptation of a new weapon and caliber may invoke criticism from our NATO allies. In the end, our research provides senior leaders with an initial recommendation for gaining overmatch capability against our peer and near-peer adversaries.

----------------

These are the four Course Of Action options evaluated:

&gt; COA1: M4a1 with m885a1 (5.56mm)

&gt; COA2: Modified M4a1 with New Intermediate Caliber Ammunition (.264 USA)

&gt; COA3: New Carbine with New Intermediate Caliber Ammunition (.264 USA)

&gt; COA4: New Carbine with m80A1 (7.62mm)

&gt;But nor should we write Russia off. We in the West should recognize that Russia’s thinking about the West is largely shaped by the perception, right or wrong, that the West seeks Russia’s demise. Our goal should be to try to change this perception. Practical steps in this direction will have to wait until Putin, with his delusional fantasies, is off the stage, but once this happens (and it will happen), we must be in a position to offer Russia a viable path to rejoining the West on respectable terms.

This keys into my 3rd point, accepting Russian concerns at face value. Russia has always had access to MAD, their ""demise"" has never been a practical threat unless you’re talking about the demise of their imperialist goals and capability to be at least a major regional power. Russia is not entitled to either of these things.

I won't say there weren't missteps in the immediate aftermath of the USSR's dissolution that could have allowed for more effective economic integration with the west. But since then Europe has practically bent over backwards to pursue that integration, even as Russian behavior has further demonstrated their imperial ambitions. A ""path to rejoining the West"" has long been there, Russia has just actively refused it in favor of trying to regain some of the Soviet glory of past empire.

Russia has been on this trajectory for close to 2 decades. Putin's rhetoric about restoring Russia to its past glory is not remotely new.

Is there info on whether ballistic missiles are significantly likely to be shot down rather than cruise missiles?

2) They can launch Kalibrs from land. To quote my other comment:

1) A ""Russian sphere of influence"" is a defacto reality that must be accepted, especially when their primary means of exerting influence is the use of force. Should Russia's assertions of that sphere of influence be left unchallenged because of their historical ties in the region?

2) Eastern European nations have no right or agency to determine their sovereignty or what ""sphere of influence"" they fall under. Frankly this is an extraordinarily transparent imperialist mindset that history has proven doesn't end especially well for anyone involved.

3) Russia's concerns about NATO should be accepted at face value despite a well documented pattern of bad faith promises and actions. In a sense, sure NATO was a red line to Russia, but not because it presented an inherent security risk (MAD is still applicable) but because it represents a barrier to Russia's **openly discussed** territorial ambitions. Would allowing those territorial ambitions to come to fruition uncontested be anything less than appeasement or in Europe's security interests? This all gets tied up in points 1 and 2 as well.

I've already made my point about Scholz, so let's talk about this other part of your claim, how Germany are already giving more aid than any other nation after the US, and how they're clearly held back by being reliant on Russia.

Have you heard of Poland?  You think Germany's dependent on Russia?  People were worried that Duda was straight up a Russian asset, and instead he's roaring like a lion.  Despite being significantly poorer than Germany they've been giving a lot - including important elements of their defense forces, while Germany over here is refusing to donate those mothballed Marders that will otherwise never see the light of day.

Like, far weaker and poorer nations than Germany are willing to hand over heavy weapons, and Scholz is over here refusing to even **sell** heavy weapons.  Like, for money.  Germany's the 2nd richest nation in NATO and (especially after Brexit) is viewed as the strongman of the EU.  Yes, there's an expectation that they'll take the initiative on this, but instead that initiative is being taken by smaller ex-Warsaw Pact states who Germans turn their nose at normally.

Between Scholz's deliberate obstructions and the simple fact of Germany's stature, I don't think it's that strange that other European nations are feeling a little... disenchanted.

The US **is** giving heavy weapons.  Plenty, actually.  Not even sure what ""broader effort"" means in this context.  Does that mean the US replacing the units Germany sends over?

The post at the head of this sub thread is the material reality of the situation - Scholtz sat on that fucking list for over a month, kept it from the public eye, and that's not even the first time he's done something like this.

That's the thing - your intentions are pretty clear here.  The original post here didn't ""single out"" germany at all.  It literally described an event that happened, Scholtz kneecapping the equipment list from alpha to omega for over a month.  It was literally something he did (not said, did).  The material reality, if you will.

You're the one ignoring that to bring up that overall Germany is pumping a lot of money into Ukraine (at least, promising to).  Which is a good thing, but not all aid is equal, and Ukraine is still under active invasion, so it's understandable they value vehicles and artillery a lot more than helmets and medical supplies.

If the German people were at the limit of what they want to give to Ukraine, that would be one thing - but there's a lot of broad popular support for some of these sales that Scholtz is singlehandedly vetoing/sabotaging.

China blockading Taiwan means China cutting off one of the busiest trade routes in the world including the main shipping lanes for Japan and South Korea.

America's opinion clearly matters in the Chinese Civil War. More generally, states often take sides in the civil wars of other states without becoming belligerents. Non-intervention in the internal affairs of others is a Chinese policy, not a global norm.

&gt;America was going around attacking communist states around China from the 50s to the 70s, establishing puppet states across Asia. You have to be delusional to think China, a communist state, watching all these communist states getting attacked by a US led collation or the US led imperialist states shouldn't be concerned.

I agree that China was very afraid of America in the 50s-70s. I am talking about the present security situation. I cannot imagine America taking over or puppeting the China of today.

&gt;Have you read the text? 
&gt;It says China.

[It says ROC.](https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/document/122101.pdf?v=d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e)

&gt;To the contrary it felt quite clear that the US and US conduits are using Taiwan as a political pressure, like a card. To deny that would be delusional. Just like Russia used refugees against Europe and China tried to use NK (or at least stop restraining NK), the US uses Taiwan in just the same way.

I don't think the US is trying to pressure China with Taiwan. The refugee crises in Europe were examples of pressure, where eastern countries were seeking concessions from western ones in exchange for making the refugee problem go away. The US isn't offering to stand aside in Taiwan in exchange for some other concession from China.

As I understand the situation, the US defends Taiwan today because they wish to contain China. It is difficult for China to realize ambitions of controlling the South China Sea without holding Taiwan. This wasn't always the case. The US of the 80s and 90s was not concerned with containment of China. They defended Taiwan then because they wanted to see a peaceful reunification with a more liberal China. Technically, the US still wants that, but sees it as hopeless.

&gt;ROC and PRC had no resolution to their conflicts. There are no treaty naming a new state. There is only one state that claims the island. That is China.

This is the PRC position, but it is not settled international law. In particular, I find the idea that states are formed by treaties is bizarre. Treaties are agreements between multiple parties, but a state does not need the agreement of others to exist.

After the bombing of Serbia that alarmed the Russians at least some of them genuinely.

Because Serbia was their “orthodox brother” and also Serbia didn’t attack a NATO state.

It shifted the calculus.

So especially the NATO intervention in Iibya which I myself disagree with, they declared a no fly zone but didn’t only do that, they did things like bombed the great man made river, also directly bombed gaddafis convoy and also  used special forces to guide the rebels to gaddafis location so they can eliminate him.

Putin being a kleptocrat murderer who bombed his own people (apartment bombings) and had mass protests before, he was very upset about the NATO intervention in Libya. Apparently obsessed with gaddafis awful death.


But the thing is this poisons all the talk about a “no fly zone”. I don’t think we should ever do one but we should give Ukraine everything they need and it should’ve been months ago.

They should get tanks with training, covert training on hand me down nato jets, but it should be now if not months ago. They should get the older drones we have I’ve forgotten if predator or reaper is older. ( rumours of this) hope CIA assets help crew them while they’re trained.

But even with all that I think western leaders are well aware of why talk of a no fly zone is poisonous. 

It will further ruin NATOs credentials as a defensive organisation, &amp; Putin will have propaganda victory because it turns it from unprovoked Russian aggression to NATO aggression.

Even so this can be fixed by NATO affirming that it is defensive only and renegotiating and affirming this and committing not to do anything out of article 5, other than supplying enhanced partners etc e.g like what they’re doing with Ukraine.

[],False,,gaiusmariusj,,,[],,,,text,t2_orwh0,False,True,"&gt;There was no common understanding of Taiwan in the Three Joint Communiques. In the third, the US acknowledged the Chinese position that Taiwan is a part of China, while China acknowledged continued US arms sales to Taiwan. They did not agree on either point 40 years ago, and they do not agree today.

Like I said, if you want to play semantic you go ahead. But my point is that this is the most sensitive of all Chinese politics, other than regime change. Just because someone was so smart to put 'acknowledge' doesn't mean much, China isn't going to change its position. This isn't to argue over the meaning of the Three Joint Communique but that these are the foundation of modern Chinese political reform and economic reforms. That China behaved in certain ways because of this understanding. 

&gt;China seems extremely secure to me at present, and the reputational damage China would take in conquest of Taiwan seems likely to make it less safe. It would be a different story in a peaceful reunification.

You are entitled to your opinions and the Chinese are entitled to theirs. You want to call it a conquest of Taiwan and the liberation of Iraq, so let's just agree that different people view different things through their political background. Like I said, China probably won't attack Taiwan out of the blue.

&gt;Does China really fear becoming an American puppet or conquest? These concepts seem laughable to me.

America was going around attacking communist states around China from the 50s to the 70s, establishing puppet states across Asia. You have to be delusional to think China, a communist state, watching all these communist states getting attacked by a US led collation or the US led imperialist states shouldn't be concerned.

Again, I'm not saying these are concerns of today, but, as I kept reiterating, these fears are assuaged through the Three Joint Communique, that the US agreed that Taiwan is a Chinese issue (ie, the US agreed that the Chinese on both sides of the strait consider this a Chinese issue).

&gt;I didn't understand this point. Was choosing to fight wrong? What was the alternative outcome?

Well, you were saying China could not fight because it was weak. I pointed out China could fight, as shown in all the wars lost. It just didn't fight for pride. 

&gt;Only the Chinese want a resolution of the Taiwan question. Everyone else wants the status quo.

Yeah, because it is a Chinese issue. The Chinese isn't going to wade into a Japanese constitutional crisis or the Australian constitutional crisis because it isn't the business of the Chinese. The reason why China wants a resolution to the Taiwan Question was because America through violence and the threat of violence paused the Chinese Civil War. If America wanted to they could have mediated the Chinese Civil War as they blockade all of China in the 50s and 60s and 70s with the ROCN. They didn't. So now PRC is strong enough to ponder to resolve the question paused by the USN.

No one else's opinion matters in the Chinese Civil War. It isn't your fucking war. It isn't your call. If you want to be a belligerent then go right ahead. If you win, you can call it whatever you want. But so long as you are not a belligerent you aren't part of this Civil War.

&gt;Regarding Taiwan, the only thing the West will try to convince China of is that invasion is a bad idea.

To the contrary it felt quite clear that the US and US conduits are using Taiwan as a political pressure, like a card. To deny that would be delusional. Just like Russia used refugees against Europe and China tried to use NK (or at least stop restraining NK), the US uses Taiwan in just the same way. 

And recent activities probably have already convinced the Chinese leaders that peaceful reunification with western support is a pipe dream, and the US led order is intent on bunting China's rise. If the goal is to convince China of anything then whoever is doing the convincing really fucked up. As I said, you need to answer 2 fundamental questions, any other fucking around is just seen as perfidious acts. 

&gt;China is not the only claimant. Cairo explicitly returned Taiwan to the ROC, which still claims the island.

Have you read the text?

It says China.

Let me just remind you a basic on international laws and sovereignty. 

There is something called a state, or a nation (though a nation is also a people) or country that has absolute power over its territory, that power is called sovereignty. 

Then there is something that is called a government. It is the bureaucracy that represents the state, but it isn't the state.

So there are the *head of state* and *head of government* because most people distinguish the two. The ROC government was the legal representation of the Chinese state. The ROC government as a government cannot hold sovereignty as it is not a state. The ROC government obtained the agreement on behalf of the Chinese state.

The PRC and ROC are not two different state, they are two different government. A new state cannot be born other than through the political agreement which accepts a new state. For example, the Confederacy isn't a state, it is a rebellion against the state in forming its own state. If it succeeded, then a new state would be born. India through treaty became a new state. 

ROC and PRC had no resolution to their conflicts. There are no treaty naming a new state. There is only one state that claims the island. That is China. There are two governments, one is the rump state of ROC. The other is the internationally recognized government of PRC. Both governments claimed, at least in principal and nominally over all of China though they only govern the territory they immediately occupied **because** the US stopped the Chinese Civil War from finalizing in the 50s.",7a996a6de2e217a67bc7cf30e5748176f4e91de1,True,False,,,,,0,1650522352,,0,{},i5l41hg,False,t3_u7ixz8,False,True,t1_i5kag7x,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u7ixz8/chinas_grand_strategy_dr_mastro_of_stanford/i5l41hg/,1650522368,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650493552.0,

How long does it take to retool a production line from 155mm to 152mm? Sounds like 2 months could have brought us close

Are Russia and Russian aligned countries the only ones that produce compatible 155mm? For instance it seems there's a [French 155mm SPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMX-30_AuF1) that's also operated by KSA, similarly [Finland has some](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/155_GH_52_APU) 155mm artillery. Are they the only ones that hold such stock?

Just seems weird to run into this problem, how is it that Ukraine did not prepare larger stocks, running out of shells two months into a war is problematic. Or did they stocks get bombed? Do they have logistic problems delivering them to the eastern frontlines?

&gt;There's no second phase, RU named it that way as information warfare. This constant pressure from RU is going on from the beginning of the war.

Call it what you will, but there was a strategical Russian shift. The forces in the east were bolstered by the forces repositioning from near Kyiv and units freed up from Mariupol and the scale of Russian pressure in the east shifted. How else does he explain that after the fronts largely stalling for more than a month (aside Izum and small other Russian advances) Russia is suddenly making much more gain throughout the east in a matter of few days?

&gt;UKR took the strategical initiative after failure of Kyiv offensive.

Odd thing to say? What initiative? Perhaps they tried near Kherson and got repelled. The initiative is still in Russian hands. 

&gt;UKR is close to taking the tactical initiative. The front lines are stabilizing.

As much as I'd like to believe this, I don't think we're seeing this on the ground yet. Russians have made a number of advances yesterday.

But I do agree with one key substance of your comment.

I do not think that Russia is really capable of being an *independent* great power without its former possessions, especially Ukraine.  One thing to keep in mind is that Ukraine was actually under a pro-western government for a long time during the 2000's and there were already spats during this time period.  My personal take is that after their guy got deposed, the Russians basically freaked out and thought that America was breaking the rules of its own game, leading them to metaphorically flip the table.

With that in mind, I do agree with your implied assumption that invading/annexing/violating Ukrainian sovereignty was not the right move in the 21st century, even if they could've gone as far as to regime change the whole thing in 2014.

In my own, very armchair opinion, I think that no matter what, Russia really only had 3 viable paths since 1991.  The first 2 are simply inverses of each other.  Become a friend to China to counterbalance the US, or vice versa.  The 3rd is the neutral option where Russia is more or less an observer of the US-China rivalry.  I would also say that this 3rd option is the most ""liberal international"" in terms of theory.  It supposes that a Russia that simply doesn't engage in most international issues would be left alone on its own terms by the US or China.

And this is where my initial statement on liberal internationalism comes into play.  My personal opinion is that American involvement in 2014 more or less eliminated the 3rd, neutral option for Russia as it meant that Russia could not reliably maintain even a small sphere of influence on its most important clients, *at a time when Russia did not actively get in the way of American foreign policy*.",e192d3f8a8426ee0d385f11db0f8422943d5c23a,True,False,,,,,0,1650519925,,0,{},i5l0plf,False,t3_u86qfm,False,True,t1_i5kvr9o,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u86qfm/was_nato_enlargement_a_mistake_foreign_affairs/i5l0plf/,1650519941,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650491125.0,

Russia fundamentally has a self-inflicted problem. Russia believes in an international system of capital-letters Great Powers competing with one another for influence. *Literally nobody else* is operating in this system. China and the US have an extremely complex relationship, and anyone who characterizes it as a Great Power conflict is pushing an agenda. 

Russia, in its imagined system of Great Power international politics, further believes that it is a Great Power. *Even if* the world worked the way Russia believes it works, *Russia still wouldn't truly be a Great Power*. They would be, at best, roughly equivalent to the Ottoman Empire circa 1914 - they'd be mentioned among the Great Powers out of courtesy. 

If Russia believes that the international system is centered around Great Powers, and it believes that Russia itself is a Great Power, then your point becomes obvious from their perspective. The US is another Great Power, NATO is a vehicle through which the US does Great Power things, Great Powers by definition exclude other Great Powers from their sphere of influence, therefore a NATO Ukraine would immediately cease military-industrial relations with Russia.

The problem is, again, that the world is not how Russia imagines it to be. Under the liberal international order, cooperation is favored over competition. The lower-case great powers want the other lower-case great powers to feel safe and secure, and are happy to help them with their security needs. The US sells its advanced weaponry to everyone in the liberal international system, and to a lot of the countries that are aspiring to become part of the system. If you said ""the US must cease weapons sales to Japan and demand exclusivity in its relations with South Korea and the Philippines to guard its sphere of influence against the Great Power of Japan"", people would wonder if you sprung to life from the pages of [an early 1990s militarist fantasy novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_of_Honor). (Roughly 80% of bad pop culture ideas about international relations can be traced back to Tom Clancy.)

**If Russia got over its institutional hubris, it could be a lot like India today.** India pursues an independent foreign and economic policy. It has a robust domestic arms industry, which nobody is trying to shut down. It buys foreign arms from a variety of sources, and everyone, with the possible exception of China, is willing to sell arms to India. Nobody thought it was strange when India announced a requirement for a large delivery of fighters and entertained proposals for the F-15, F-16, F/A-18, Gripen, Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, MiG-35 and Su-35 - every manufacturer of advanced aircraft, with the exception of China.

Literally nobody is bothered when an Indian air exercise features a Russian A-50 which fuses intelligence from a Brazilian EMB-145, an American P-8I and an Israeli IAI Heron UAV to direct a flight of French Rafales to clear the air for British Jaguar ground-attack fighters, American AH-64E and Russian Mi-24 attack helicopters to attack a position so indigenous Indian HAL Rudras can land special forces. None of the suppliers are concerned about supplying arms to a rising Great Power, and none of them are trying to secure exclusivity with political maneuvering. Everyone involved understands that helping India feel more secure helps us all be more secure. 

This could be Russia. Russia manufactures some excellent military equipment. When Portugal has a requirement to replace its fighter fleet, there's no reason Sukhoi couldn't put in a bid for the Su-35 and have it taken seriously. It would likely be rejected, but for practical reasons, not because Portugal is an American vassal and the US cannot tolerate interference from another Great Power.",038fe86d3e357e418bc25c6de1f7f4976ee83cc7,True,False,,,,,0,1650516622,,0,{},i5kvr9o,False,t3_u86qfm,False,True,t1_i5k5v81,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u86qfm/was_nato_enlargement_a_mistake_foreign_affairs/i5kvr9o/,1650516633,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650487822.0,

His main points are:

* UKR needs artillery systems and ammunition. RU can only push because UKR is low on artillery ammunition.
* NATO cannot provide 152mm steadily as it's not mass producing them (so maybe that's why 155mm systems are the talk now)
* There's no second phase, RU named it that way as information warfare. This constant pressure from RU is going on from the beginning of the war.
* RU is not trying to encircle Donbas, it's trying to take over Luhansk region completely by creating a threat of encirclement. This is one 'big' victory they can sell at home for now.
* Regular army losses are comparatively light but TDF losses are big.
* UKR took the strategical initiative after failure of Kyiv offensive.

Besides, the breakup of the USSR vastly reduced Russian capacity to harm China, along with the possibility of direct border conflict.

The argument that the Baltics/Poland joining NATO was somehow a violation of Russian security, and up-ended regional security balances in Eastern Europe is a farce. Never mind that last I checked, NATO has invaded 0 neighboring countries under offensive operations within Europe in the past 2 decades, while Russia has. Yes, its clearly the expansion of NATO that has forced Russia into these circumstances and not Russia’s propensity to invade sovereign neighbors.

&amp;#x200B;

I think it should be noted that NATO's expansion was heavily implied in the NATO-Russia Founding Act. Specifically in Section IV Paragraph 1:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The member States of NATO reiterate that they have no intention, no plan and no reason to deploy nuclear weapons on the territory of new members, nor any need to change any aspect of NATO's nuclear posture or nuclear policy - and do not foresee any future need to do so. This subsumes the fact that NATO has decided that it has no intention, no plan, and no reason to establish nuclear weapon storage sites on the territory of those members, whether through the construction of new nuclear storage facilities or the adaptation of old nuclear storage facilities. Nuclear storage sites are understood to be facilities specifically designed for the stationing of nuclear weapons, and include all types of hardened above or below ground facilities (storage bunkers or vaults) designed for storing nuclear weapons.

Last time I checked the Russian Federation's signature was on that document. So it shouldn't be a surprise that NATO's open door policy extended to former Eastern Bloc countries. 

Ten days ago it was being reported that NATO is drawing up plans to establish a permanent presence in Eastern Europe. Although, it seems the headlines making that claim have been changed that at the request of NATO. However, Stoltenberg said:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What we see now is a new reality, a new normal for European security. Therefore, we have now asked our military commanders to provide options for what we call a reset, a more longer-term adaptation of NATO. I expect that NATO leaders will make decisions on this when they meet in Madrid at the NATO summit in June.

Do you think NATO will establish a permanent presence in Eastern Europe going forward? 

That move would absolutely breach the NATO-Russia Founding Act. It seems Stoltenberg is laying the foundation for NATO to argue that Russia's invasion of Ukraine represents a fundamental shift in the security environment on the Eurasian continent; therefore, justifying NATO's permanent presence in the East. While I agree with his sentiment, I'm surprised this fundamental shift in NATO's position was underreported to say the least.",cece6a77dfa65a32dd2f48d6f75fd991819af0a1,True,False,,,,,0,1650512602,,0,{},i5konl0,False,t3_u86qfm,False,True,t1_i5jtdy0,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u86qfm/was_nato_enlargement_a_mistake_foreign_affairs/i5konl0/,1650512619,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650483802.0,

[],False,,abn1304,,,[],,,,text,t2_uob0u,False,False,"A Wild Weasel is an aircraft flying a Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD) mission. In the past the USAF had dedicated aircraft for that. Now they use F-16s (and presumably F-35s) equipped with anti-radiation missiles that track and destroy radar along with radar detectors and long-range cruise missiles. Networked warfare also allows aircraft equipped with radar detectors to locate enemy radar and relay their location to cruise missiles and other standoff munitions, something the F-35 was specifically designed for.

That leaves radar operators with a choice: run their radar and risk getting hit, or turn their radars off and be blind. In practice, the answer is to “pulse” a radar, which makes it pretty difficult to track enemy aircraft or to detect stealth aircraft at all, and China’s existing systems are mostly older technology (SA-10s with a handful of SA-20s and 21s) so it’s pretty questionable whether they can even track F-35s and F-22s, much less low-altitude cruise missiles.

Unless China has enough LRAD, long-range air defense, that they can risk throwing them away, they have to either take a huge risk by constantly running radar or leave their fleet unprotected against US airstrikes.

LRAD is also not very good at intercepting small, agile targets like fighters. That’s just physics. LRAD missiles have to be huge in order to carry enough fuel to travel long distances, so they’re best suited for shooting down bombers, which is what the SA-10 and SA-20 were designed to do. It’s possible the SA-21 can engage ballistic missiles, but US Patriot systems have a pretty poor track record with that and China’s electronics are partially copied from Patriot. If we weren’t successful, it’s unlikely a reverse-engineered copy grafted onto a Soviet rocket would do better. Further, a ballistic missile is a very different target profile than a cruise missile or fighter - much harder to hit, but much, *much* easier to track.

It’s also very difficult to positively ID a target at long range if they aren’t running IFF, or if your trackers can’t communicate with or read the target’s IFF.

SHORAD or MRAD on ships don’t have those problems, exactly. They may as well run their radar because it’s not like a surface ship can hide in the Taiwan Strait. On the flip side, it’s not air threats they need to worry about, it’s submarines.

So, if the US does not immediately enter a theoretical war on Taiwan’s side, we’re back to a dilemma for the Chinese: either not use any sort of LRAD or MRAD, or engage targets and hope they don’t launch at a US aircraft. Neither one is a good answer, which means that dilemma is a strategic deterrent for China.",52445facd51f0eb17650b637b1122c6fda220414,True,False,,,,,0,1650510997,,0,{},i5kljgr,False,t3_u5rixy,False,True,t1_i5kjifb,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u5rixy/hostile_harbors_taiwans_ports_and_pla_invasion/i5kljgr/,1650511014,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650482197.0,

Realistically, would Ukraine joining NATO really have done so much to drastically improve standard of living in Ukraine? Ukraine is a deeply corrupt country, much like Russia. They came out of the same system, a lot of shared history.

Even if Ukraine had manage to double their GDP per capita, it would still be 30% lower than Russian GDP per capita. And Russian GDP per capita is kind of deceptive, because it varies dramatically on area. Ukraine is 3.5k, Russia is 10.2k - but around Moscow (and other urban centers) is closer to 22k - on par with Poland.

It would take a very long time, even with EU integration and western backing for Ukraine to even reach parity with Russia, and longer yet to reach parity with the urban regions like Moscow, where Russian national identity more or less comes from.

I really don't think this is a strong argument. I think a much stronger argument for Russia's invasion is just one of national pride. Russia feels like it owns Ukraine. NATO taking it is an almost ideological attack on the Russian identity.

your assertion is basically:

1. that russia drove countries into nato's arms by aggressively waging war against chechnya. this is not true. post-soviet countries began to seek nato membership in 1991. they had hundreds of years of reasons to not trust russia, russia did not have to do anything for them to seek entrance into america's nuclear umbrella. you are also vastly simplifying the chechen wars by just calling them ""russian aggression,"" they were definitely not imperial wars in the sense that the war on ukraine can be pretty easily construed as.

2. that russia's only reason for opposing nato expansion is that they cannot seize the baltics ""as a jumping off point."" this makes no sense to me and seems baseless. what is your source on that?

3. the stability of the continent is jarred because russia has drifted from friendly to the west, to distrustful, to completely hostile. if we could not deter russia, we would want to have prevented that drift from happening. any rational leader of russia would have perceived actions from 1991-2008 as being designed to diplomatically isolate russia, so there is reason for them to have drifted that way. if we could not keep them friendly, then we would want to contain/deter them - that failed too, because we did not extend guarantees to georgia or ukraine desite ample opportunity to do so. i mean, how can you pretend like the 2008 invasion of georgia was not linked to the bucharest conference? georgia's nato ambitions were the key factor there, and russia *succeeded* in derailing nato enlargement by doing so.

4. you are essentially saying - no matter what, russia was going to try and reconstruct the russian empire because that is just what russia does. i do not think that is true, and the fact that russia sought good relations with the west for years is evidence of that. it takes two to tango, and russia's most aggressive action - the invasion of georgia - while the bush administration was pursuing very nakedly aggressive action in tearing up the abm treaty and trying to build an anti-missile base in poland. while russia bears moral responsibility for its crimes, it isn't like we were sitting there with our arms out wide trying to embrace russia.",5f611967c1ce68c66903eeb6f0ed172568a1ed1a,True,False,,,,,0,1650508105,,0,{},i5kfc9p,False,t3_u86qfm,False,False,t1_i5k83bg,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u86qfm/was_nato_enlargement_a_mistake_foreign_affairs/i5kfc9p/,1650508117,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650479305.0,

&gt; **Russian War-game of the Battle of Tannenberg**

&gt; Just prior to World War 1, the Russian General Staff conducted a war-game of a Russian invasion of East Prussia by the First and Second Russian Armies in a two-pronged assault. During the wargame, each Russian army was isolated, and in turn destroyed, by the smaller, quicker German force. Furious, the two Russian commanders demanded the war-game’s facilitator change his adjudication of how quickly the German forces could move, slowing them down considerably. Under intense pressure, the facilitator restarted the war-game, slowing there German and allowing the two-pronged attack to succeed spectacularly. Four months later, when the same plan was executed on the real battlefield, the Germans moved quickly as the facilitator had originally predicted and destroyed both Russian armies one at a time: The first one at Tannenberg and the second one a week later at Masurian Lakes. The Russians were rejected from East Prussia, suffering over 300,000 casualties.

It was followed a little while later by this tip on conducting a better wargame:

&gt; **Tip.** Oversized personalities can have oversized impacts on adjudication results. The facilitator must be forceful in keeping outcomes realistic, and not favoring those with the loudest voices or the most rank. 

-------------

I was thinking about how to do this in the civilian world, and I think there would have to be a rule of no resumes and no rank in order to keep people from trying to bully the White Cell (the proctor of the wargame).

Russia’s offensive in eastern Ukraine secured minor gains in the last 24 hours, taking parts of the key frontline towns of Rubizhne and Popasna.

Ukrainian forces reported the presence of small numbers of Syrian or Libyan mercenaries fighting in Popasna (eastern Ukraine), likely individual recruits fighting under the umbrella of the Wagner Group rather than larger units.

Russian forces made incremental advances in Mariupol and continued to set conditions to declare victory in the city by –at the latest – May 9.

I don't know that expanding NATO was a mistake per se. I do think we did without properly understanding that as we moved outwards into what used to be the Russian sphere of influence, Russia was inevitably going to be increasingly anxious and insecure about it.

That should have led us to realize that for the dwindling number of countries that were left outside NATO -- namely, Ukraine in this case -- our expansion made them more vulnerable.

We had seven years after Crimea to decide whether (a) Ukraine was worth defending, in which case we could have prevented this war by stationing American troops there; or (b) we needed to be brutally honest and tell the Ukrainians we wouldn't be there for them. Either of those would have been safe choices; which one is a better choice depends on how isolationist you are.

Instead we dicked around and didn't decide we really cared about Ukraine until **after** it was too late to prevent the war, and now we're trying to play catch-up by risking nuclear war.

[],False,,Dramatic_Quiet_5796,,,[],,,,text,t2_k3mdzzkd,False,False,"Here's a few key tid-bits around Ukraine's de-nuclearisation that really show how much NATO actually helped (while not being completely central to the issue itself) taken from my chapter:

The first plan Ukraine proposed contradicted its obligations under the Lisbon and Alma-Ata, however demonstrated Ukraine’s threat perceptions along with its perceived regional belonging in the Post-Cold War security framework. One idea proposed by president Leonid Kravchuk was to extend a Ukrainian security guarantee to Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia in exchange for their lobbying to preserve Ukraine as a nuclear state. The “Kravchuk Plan”, as it was known, was Ukraine’s attempt to leverage its nuclear weaponry in exchange for its security. However, the Kravchuk Plan would not give up Ukraine’s nuclear arsenal, but instead, leverage them in order to propel Ukraine into the geopolitical lynchpin of Central-Eastern Europe.  This proposal was met with skepticism due to Central-Eastern European states potentially exploring NATO membership and Ukraine’s lack of credibility as a historical great power. However, Lech Walesa mentioned planning an alliance with Ukraine if Poland could not join NATO during the meeting which led to the infamous August 25th communique stating Russia’s non-objection to Poland joining NATO.  The proposal demonstrated two important facets of Ukraine’s perceptions of security early on. Firstly, that it saw itself as naturally aligned with the interests of Central-Eastern Europe in an intermarium-styled security bloc that was neither Russian nor German (meaning, Western) dominated. Secondly, that Ukraine saw itself as a potential regional power to counter-balance a rising (re-unified) Germany and a potential revanchist Russia in the future. 

Leonid Kravchuk, failing in persuading Central-Eastern European states to form a security coalition, began to negotiate with the USA in 1992. He went as far as to ask for a NATO-style Article-5 guarantee in exchange for Ukraine’s de-nuclearization.  This plan failed too, which left Ukraine to deal with nuclear issues with Russia on a bilateral basis, which ultimately led to the failures of the Massandra Summit in late 1993. Nevertheless, the request for Article-5 guarantee was in itself ambitious and demonstrated Ukraine’s perceptions of threats emanating from the east. The USA, whose interests were also at stake in Ukraine’s nuclear non-proliferation, introduced itself via a new trilateral format to mediate Ukraine-Russia negotiations and to secure its own interests – which in this case, were completely in-synch with Russia’s. It had been offering to mediate nuclear discussions between Ukraine and Russia since early 1993 after taking a hardline stance against Ukraine’s reluctance to surrender its arsenal.  The result was the Trilateral Process which was aimed at reaching the “minimum” position of each party involved. For Russia and the West, this was Ukraine’s total nuclear disarmament and accession to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. For Ukraine, the minimum position was security guarantees, recognition of its borders and economic partnership.  The text of the Trilateral Summit achieved each state’s minimum position. Ukraine achieved its desire to treated as an independent and foreign state.  On the economic side, it would be receiving US$200 million in compensation for its nuclear arsenal from the USA. 

The final result of the Trilateral Process was the creation of the Budapest Memorandum, which was signed by Ukraine’s newly elected president, Leonid Kuchma. The Memorandum stipulated that Ukraine would receive security assurances from the UK, USA, and Russia in exchange for relinquishing its nuclear arsenal. Furthermore, the signatories of the memorandum would refrain from coercion, be it economic or military in their relations with Ukraine.  Ukraine’s leadership placed the memorandum in Ukraine’s official treaty book, denoting its perceived significance to the Ukrainian state, despite it being officially not being a treaty.  After the initial signing of the Budapest Memorandum, China and France extended security assurances to Ukraine, signifying its legitimacy and acceptance by all P5 members of the UN Security Council. 

The arduous process for Ukraine’s full relinquishment of nuclear weapons was a portent for Ukraine-Russia relations in the future. Ukraine, fearing Russian designs on its territory and control of its political process, sought to incorporate the West to balance against Russian predominance in the region in order increase its bargaining position. In the case of nuclear weaponry, Russian and US interests were aligned. By stalling on nuclear disarmament, and the various proposals floated, Ukrainian leadership demonstrated its intent to be treated as a sovereign and independent state free of overarching or dominant Russian influence. It also demonstrated the persistence of the “civilized divorce” dynamic across another front which was purely confined to the sphere of security. The nuclear issue was also instrumental in increasing western involvement in the Post-Soviet region (outside the Baltics) to include Ukraine as a meaningful partner in both European and global politics.",40b17ba9c1828a6983b2c75384e33e3f987d7d9e,True,False,,,,,0,1650506060,,0,{},i5kas1h,False,t3_u86qfm,False,True,t1_i5ka977,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u86qfm/was_nato_enlargement_a_mistake_foreign_affairs/i5kas1h/,1650506072,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1650477260.0,

This only changed with the Three Joint Communique. And the Three Joint Communique is rooted in the understanding of Taiwan. People can argue about semantics about the meaning of the wordings, but let's not kid what the Chinese meant about the danger and sensitivity of Taiwan.

There was no common understanding of Taiwan in the Three Joint Communiques. In the [third](https://www.ait.org.tw/our-relationship/policy-history/key-u-s-foreign-policy-documents-region/u-s-prc-joint-communique-1982/), the US acknowledged the Chinese position that Taiwan is a part of China, while China acknowledged continued US arms sales to Taiwan. They did not agree on either point 40 years ago, and they do not agree today.

&gt;Economics is good, but the economics is based on a certain understanding of security. That the US isn't interested in taking over China or puppeting China.  
  
It doesn't mean China is going to just invade Taiwan out of the blue, but it certainly does not mean when push comes to shove, the economic side will win out against security.

China seems extremely secure to me at present, and the reputational damage China would take in conquest of Taiwan seems likely to make it less safe. It would be a different story in a peaceful reunification.

Does China really fear becoming an American puppet or conquest? These concepts seem laughable to me.

&gt;I like to point out that the reason China was defeated was because both China was weak and China fought.

I didn't understand this point. Was choosing to fight wrong? What was the alternative outcome?

&gt;If you want to resolve Taiwan peaceful you must convince the Chinese.

Only the Chinese want a resolution of the Taiwan question. Everyone else wants the status quo. Regarding Taiwan, the only thing the West will try to convince China of is that invasion is a bad idea.

&gt;First, do you think spoil of war in the end of 19th and 20th century is acceptable, as pointed out in the Cairo Declaration and Potsdam Declaration?  
&gt;

What the capabilities and realities of the matter are are purely counterfactual (that's how counterfactuals work). The path towards Ukraine actually becoming a nuclear power *would* have provoked a lot of disasters. Another reason why NATO expansion did help. As for your second point, the PfP was a very important part of allaying Ukraine's fears of Russian encroachment on their sovereignty. 1997 Sea Breeze exercises took place in Crimea, that simulated a ""hostile nation"" trying to forcibly annex the peninsula. PfP was built for Russia and for Ukraine too. 

NATO expansion helped both points. It calmed Poland's vision of a new intermarium with a potentially nuclear-capable Ukraine (path towards which would have been very arduous and provocative). It also eased concerns with a de-nuclearised Ukraine; the Budapest Memorandum was the main focus. While PfP was not at the centre of the debate, it served was an added bonus to Ukraine which hoped to form a ""special relationship"" with NATO like Russia. It also helped balance Ukraine away from Russia's security interests and maintain its vision of independence.

[],False,,canhisto,,,[],,,,text,t2_dkbzsc4s,False,False,"*A conventional war between Russia and Ukraine would entail vast military casualties and the possible murder of many thousands of civilians. Russians and Ukrainians have a history of mutual enmity; this hostility, combined with the intermixing of their populations, raises the possibility that war between them could entail Bosnian style ethnic cleansing and mass murder. This war could produce millions of refugees clamoring at the borders of Western Europe...*

*There is also the threat of escalation beyond the borders of Russian and Ukraine. For example, the Russians might decide to reconquer other parts of the former Soviet Union in the midst of a war, or might try to take back some of Eastern Europe. Poland and Belarus might join forces with Russia against Ukraine or gang up with Ukraine to prevent a Russian resurgence. The Germans, Americans or Chinese could get pulled in by their fear of a Russian victory. (Doubters should remember that the UnitedStates had no intention of fighting in Europe when war broke out in 1914 and again in 1939.) Finally, nuclear weapons might be used accidentally or purposefully against a third state.*

*The security environment in Europe would certainly become heated and competitive in the wake of a Russian war with Ukraine. Other great powers would move quickly and sharply to contain further Russian expansion. The Russians would then think seriously? for security reasons?about controlling their many smaller neighbors. Other great powers would move to check them.*
