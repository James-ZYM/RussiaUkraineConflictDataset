India is not particularly ""dependent"" in terms of being a large aid sink anymore if that's what you mean. 

The country has little pull in part because it has chosen not to get involved (for the most part) at the world stage as of yet. This is kind of to the chagrin of America, since we want India to play a more active role in the security of the Indian ocean to counterweight a (continuing) massive Chinese naval buildup. Stronger bilateral ties between the US and India are gradually happening, but it's a process that only started in the late '90s. Strengthening our ties with India is absolutely one of our more important goals in asia. 

&gt;who can’t afford high value added goods

I mean, it's not like there aren't people who can't afford this in India. The potential size of the Indian middle class is extremely large. It's also why many American companies absolutely see India as a important strategic future growth driver, even consumer retailers such as amazon and walmart who have made investments in massive Indian operations.  These types of companies cater to services based economic growth and a rapidly urbanizing country. Plus, China as a market is closed off to a lot of American companies.

India has significant challenges particularly with respect to important economic reforms, but that's not to say they have not made progress in reducing poverty and will not continue to develop and slowly emerge as a important country in the world stage.

The nuclear deterrent isn't exactly a new thing. The article is talking about a decline in relative American strength, but what you are talking about is a reality that has been around for about 70 years.

&gt;Everybody knows the MIC is everything the US invests in, and it's shown to be relatively useless right now.

How so? Just by arming the Ukrainians they have largely succeeded without having to put boots on the ground. 

And, it also bears saying: you seem to be treating this as a US war, but it isn't and never has been. How has a military who hasn't engaged in the conflict ""shown to be relatively useless""?

The only military that has shown to be relatively useless is a Russian war machine that was supposed to be the second largest in the world, yet, can't even take the capital of a former puppet state.

&gt;Also, given the abstains in the more UN votes shows that most of the world has no desire in choosing a particular side.

The vote on condemning the invasion was 141 to 5 with 34 abstentions. The only real noteworthy countries abstaining were China, India and Pakistan. The only surprises with those was that China chose to abstain instead of supporting Russia. Much of the other abstentions were former Soviet states like Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, etc, who again are wins for not voting with Russia, and a smattering of African nations with little international relevance (Congo, Central African Republic, South Sudan, etc).

When it comes to the world's more powerful, developed countries, the condemnation of Russia has been largely unanimous. 17 of the world's top 20 economies voted to condemn Russia's invasion, with the only exceptions being China, India and Russia, itself.

&gt;Finally, the only serious threat a lot of countries might be worried about in fact, in regards to the cards the US has displayed vs Russia, is the threat of possibly being excluded from the American led financial system. But if you look at the data, all this has done is caused many countries to start diversifying away from it. Alternatives were already being built, and now they are probably going to become more and more standardized since the Russian case shows you have to make contingencies and cannot suppose you can always rely on the US financial system to have your back.

Do you have any of this data to back up what you are saying? Because I haven't seen it.

They have acted against the interests of a country they deem as a major defense partner moving forward in the region, India, by driving Russia into the hands of China. Plus the whole indo pacific strategy of competition with China revolved around the strait of malacca to blockade and freeze up the chinese economy. Well that plan will soon have to be completely dropped as the Chinese are en route to securing resources via land and sea routes from russia alongside with creating a land route through CPEC to warm water Pakistani ports.

Furthermore China + Russia are making huge headways in terms of raising the prominence of certain international forums throughout Eurasia, such as BRICS, SCO, OPEC+, CSTO etc. They have basically swung a large portions of the arab states their way and even countries such as India are taking notice and hedging their bets between the western block and the emerging Eurasian block.

Look at a country like Vietnam that America has been courting, go look at how disastrous the kamala harris trip was for relations. Kamala basically is out there making grandiose statements about the Chinese and the vietnamese are summoning chinese officials to tell them to take no heed to the words of Kamala in her visit and that it won't damage Vietnam Chinese relations. You can look at how Saudi Arabia refuses Biden calls, you can look at how Israel is diversifying its currency reserves and you can even look at the recent brics financial sherpa meeting where they discussed on how to mitigate the effects of sanctions on Russia.

It undoubtedly is a post american world because we used to live in a unipolar moment, hell at points in time the US even could get through the security council whatever it wanted as Yeltsin wouldn't veto and the chinese weren't interested in being the sole dissenting voice. When you compare those times to now, it is clear that the world is in the post american world. Yes the US is a major power and still will have a huge role on the world stage, but it no longer exists in the unipolar moment it has squandered away on meaningnless neocon adventures.",caeae3d99028dc53ef29a04523034b02600ea406,True,False,,,,,0,1650575814,,0,{},i5o2rcn,False,t3_u8nqc8,False,True,t1_i5mg9wg,/r/geopolitics/comments/u8nqc8/the_return_of_statecraft_back_to_basics_in_the/i5o2rcn/,1650575830,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1650547014.0,

Everybody knows the MIC is everything the US invests in, and it's shown to be relatively useless right now.
Sure the US has some strong allies, and NATO is nice, but again, nukes. US can rally NATO against Russia because Russia attacked, but other countries with much less casus belli.
Also, given the abstains in the more UN votes shows that most of the world has no desire in choosing a particular side.

Finally, the only serious threat a lot of countries might be worried about in fact, in regards to the cards the US has displayed vs Russia, is the threat of possibly being excluded from the American led financial system. But if you look at the data, all this has done is caused many countries to start diversifying away from it.

1) India can remain neutral, and the status quo remains.

If you don't consider the US to be that strong or reliable, then why would you risk it??

If you don't understand why, again it just means you're unable to recognize and empathize with India's actual situation because you don't really care about what happens to India.

India has to be precautionary in regards to it's neighbors since **they will always be India's neighbors**. If things go bad, the US can just return to isolate itself worst case with no neighbors to worry about (at least right now). India cannot. Hence, it has to always take account the long run relationship with it's neighbors into account.

This doesn't mean that India should side with it's neighbors, just that's it's not in it's best interest to overly inflame the region by siding with any party too much (which is why it's pushing for more military equipment independence to remain neutral), especially for a feeble reason given their perspective, and pressure from a country shown to be very unreliable in recent decades, one that is speaking down to it in the first place (highlighting that the US themselves don't fully trust nor like India in the first place).

While the US has arguably reduced in relative power based on the rise of China, China has really just replaced the rival that the US had for most of post-WW2 history: the Soviets.

At their height, the Soviets were arguably a larger challenge to American hegemony than China currently is (especially because of how expansionist the Russians are when compared to the Chinese), but the war in Ukraine currently seems to be showing us exactly how weak that formerly powerful rival has become.

The huge number of countries that the Russians used to control in the Soviet days, are now mostly NATO members. The Ukrainian war is the death throes of a formerly powerful empire. Even in a war against a former puppet state, Russia has been rebuffed, with the US needing to do nothing more than supply arms. Without the US providing any troops, the Ukrainians managed to hold Kiev and push the Russians back.

The war has also accomplished a lot of other things. It has strengthened NATO resolve, in a way that hasn't been seen in decades. It has brought Finland and Sweden to the brink of NATO membership. And, it has given the West the justification to put the boots to the Russian economy, which, combined with the ongoing brain drain from Russia and their demographic crisis, is likely to mean that Russia won't be much of a global power for the foreseeable future.

I would contest the claim that Russia is a pariah anywhere outside the west, but regardless, what you're missing is that it goes directly against India's long-term interests to see Russia pushed right into China's open arms. The more dependent Russia is on China, the more China benefits, and the worse India's position in Asia becomes.

India would benefit more if it and the west built closer ties with Russia to counter its ties with China. The west is obviously unwilling to pursue this course anymore, which is fair, but at the same time, Russia has shown itself more eager to pursue close relations with India because at the end of the day it's not in Russia's interests either to become too dependent on China.

If we ignore for now the matter of the west's opposition and view the relationship on its own terms, India stands to benefit a great deal from closer ties with Russia. Thus, if India is to turn down this opportunity, there must be something further for it to gain from doing so, and so the question is, what does the west offer it instead?

To say that it offers India a partnership against China is misleading, as the west would be opposed to China regardless of India's decision because it's in all of their interests to oppose China. We might say that it offers India military aid in the case of a Sino-Indian war breaking out, but it's an open question how much such aid would be worth. After all, the west still hasn't directly intervened in the Russian-Ukrainian war, a war which is much closer to the west and against a weaker foe than China; would they really provide more aid for a war taking place half a world away?

Aside from that, the only other thing the west has used to try and convince India is the threat of sanctions, and imposing sanctions on what is potentially their biggest partner against China is the single biggest mistake the west could commit.

In effect, the west is threatening India to get it to harm itself and Russia while strengthening China, this despite Russia being friendly to India and China being its biggest threat. They are asking India to weaken its own position against China in exchange for nothing.

But if we don't do that we will soon see the dollar lose supremacy as the world reserve currency, which will obliterate our economy.

2. China has *border disputes* with India. 
3. China is allied with Pakistan. 
4. This pits India in direct confrontation with China and Pakistan. 
5. The US had a falling out with Pakistan. A very public one. 
6. The US is courting India. 

Somehow in all of this, you guys see some nefarious US plan to “destroy” India and tear it away from its dead old friend Russia - supplier of flying coffins. Your pilots’ words, not mine.

While material support from third countries was never likely to exceed abstaining at the UN (which is a rather powerful signal in itself, and one imagines some heated conversations between governments occurred in private), the 'approach' taken by certain Western countries seems almost designed to convert this situation from being about Russia to being about the West v. the Rest.   

That said, several specific claims in the article don't hold. ISIS ultimately descends from Al-Qaida in Iraq; even setting aside the history of it, Al-Zarqawi's writings clearly are a predecessor of their philosophy, worldview, and conduct.   

The implied claim that the US used sanctions to replace Iran as a petroleum provider to India don't seem accurate. Using the Observatory of Economic Complexity for easy visualisation, [The USA is #3 in the world for crude petroleum exports and #3 for crude petroleum exports to India, basically matched.](https://oec.world/en/profile/hs92/crude-petroleum) This surge in exports began in [the early 2010s, prior to sanctions, following the broader path of increasing US oil production/exports](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=MTTEXIN2&amp;f=A). The author names China, but China shows the same trend of increasing US imports, suggesting that there isn't a special rivalry between American and Iranian oil. [Iranian total exports under the reimposed sanctions regime (after 2018) are officially ~0,5 million bbl/day](https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/about_us/163.htm), against Indian import demand of [4 million bbl/day](https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/india/crude-oil-imports). Given that sanctions would be the primary reason for any discount on Iranian oil, the cost to India of this policy seems limited, though the benefits to Iran are also limited, suggesting that Indian should've been granted a sanctions waiver.  

Given the proudly independent posture of India, and the difficulty of impartially judging territorial disputes, the author's complaint that US support for India on the subject is insufficient is interesting. Certainly, reading Chinese sources would suggest that China is the victim of Indian aggression in that area. When border clashes with China intensified, US officials did make statements, the majority of which were calls for negotiations, or taking India's side.  

One also finds it interesting (this isn't limited to India) how ignored and unloved the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan was until it was gone, at which point it transformed in the eyes of the world into a bulwark against the terror. 

&gt; The main brunt of the rise of a more powerful and aggressive China will be borne by its neighbors, especially India. Unlike Japan and Australia, which are under the U.S. security and nuclear umbrella, India must deal with China on its own   

Article would've benefitted from more analysis of India's options in a scenario of estrangement from the US &amp; Company. 'Hindi Chini Bhai Bhai' is not realistic (both parties would have the other's complete concession on outstanding issues as a starting point), and would necessarily force India into the role of a junior partner. Russia won't back India against China in any meaningful way. India's relations with other interested parties aren't strong enough to substitute for the US, and would be weakened by an India-US falling out. India's comprehensive national power lags China's considerably, and its development would be severely impacted by a lonely stand against China. And given that China is a major security threat in the perceptions of India and her people anyway, the US obtains India *en passant* unless it acts with almost cartoonish levels of incompetence and malice.

By 2022 IMF data India is the world's 6th largest economy by nominal GDP, almost level with the UK, at around $3.3T. For reference, the US is at $25T, China at $20T, Japan at $4.9T and Germany at $4.2T.

By PPP it is the third largest economy by some distance. China is first at $30T, the US ay $25T, and India is at $11.7T, with Japan at $6.1T and Germany at $5.3T.

Looking at growth rates, India has been experiencing phenomenal growth rates since 2000, which have been overshadowed by China's even more phenomenal growth rates. But India has caught up recently and has been growing faster than China recently. Granted the pandemic has had serious effects on this, but looking at the overall 2000-2019 data you see that India's growth has been spectacular.

Demographically India is the only gigantic economy with a growing demography. Going down the list of nominal GDP you have to get to #16 Mexico to find another country that has a population pyramid which is both growing and stable (ie not top heavy). So the medium term furure of India's economy and miliyary consists of a surplus of young and dynamic manpower.

Along with the US, China, Russia, Japan, and the European bloc, India is and will continue to be a first-order strategic power in the arena of the 21st century. The US should acfept that India is neutral between itself and Russia, and not drive it further towards the Russian side with condescending rhetoric. The US's long term interest is in supporting India in growing into its natural position as a balancer against China; it should not antagonize one of the fundamental pillars of the coming century.",cc86d57e19bb1193d65ec6293d2d07bb3932d1e4,True,False,,,,,0,1650553035,,0,{},i5mh0a8,False,t3_u8meu9,False,True,t1_i5lxxr2,/r/geopolitics/comments/u8meu9/washingtons_clumsy_attempts_to_bully_india_must/i5mh0a8/,1650553053,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1650524235.0,

China is strong but I’m skeptical about them still. They’re definitely stronger than Russia though. So I don’t think we’re anywhere near a post-American world, which I would not want anyway. 

Also, it’s funny that the article starts off by saying, “for 70 years the US bestrode the world like a colossus.” Because, yeah, they’ve been strong that whole time but it’s only been a unipolar world for about 30 years after fall of USSR. It wasn’t that long ago where we lived in a bipolar world and the US had to engage in statecraft to counter the Soviets, which they did. 

The US is in a much stronger position versus Russia now than they ever were versus the USSR during the Cold War. I’d argue that the Europeans are stronger than Russia too, if they so choose. 

China is the real challenge to the US. But China has a lot of internal problems too and things to overcome. Can’t underestimate them but China’s dominance is not a given.

Let me get this straight. 

India bought some rusted heaps of garbage from Russia in the 60's and you need maintenance for them. They need their Mig-21's in excellent tip-top shape so that Pakistan can shoot them down even easier. Which they've proven to be really good at with their F16's. 

And so for that, India is willing to tie itself to Russia for the foreseeable future, because they really really need parts for their 1960's Soviet-era arsenal. 

Now - how do you think they're going to get *anything* in another 2-3 years of sanctions on Russia? You know they already shut down their one and only tank factory - right? You know they can't produce ball bearings even, so they have to import them? Did you know that? And now they can't? And you expect them to deliver Su-57's to India? In large numbers? 

They produced a dozen *prototypes* in 20 years *before* sanctions. What armaments is India gonna buy from them in the future, besides some ""slightly used"" T-72's they have in storage? 

That's India's long-term strategy? For that they're willing to just let their relationship with the West deteriorate? Ok. 

You know, they *could* buy jets from France, Sweden? Like actual modern, affordable, jets. Plenty of other countries who can't afford US tech do. 

Like I said - not ready for the big leagues. India can go ahead and tie their economic future to an imploding dictatorship. See how smart that looks in another 5 years. 

By the way - did you know that Tata (yes, *that* Tata) now refuses to do business with Russia?

""For the foreseeable future, the United States will remain powerful. Although China’s rise means that it may not have the world’s largest economy forever, it will certainly have the second-largest and possibly the most dynamic and globally connected one. It has one of the biggest and most experienced militaries on the planet, along with plentiful allies. Above all, the United States has a demonstrated resilience going back to its founding. It has been rent before, suffered grievous economic setbacks, and, time and again, bounced back.  


Nonetheless, relative decline is a fact. Historians will dissect why the age of American dominance ended when it did and whether its disappearance might have been delayed or mitigated. The question now, however, is how the United States should adjust to its changing position. The response will have many elements, but the most important is attitudinal. After decades of relying on big strategic ideas that are translated into policy by complex and arduous bureaucratic processes, the U.S. government must return to statecraft. This means an approach that embodies a fine-grained comprehension of the world, the ability to quickly detect and respond to challenges, a penchant for exploiting opportunities as they arise, and, behind all of this, effective institutions for the formulation and conduct of a nimble foreign policy.  


In the previous era, the United States was strong enough to get away with less-than-perfect implementation of its big ideas. Its unrivaled power granted it a wide margin of error, enough space so that Washington could get most of what it wanted, no matter what its level of competence. Today, when it is much harder for Washington to call the shots, the problems it faces demand not more abstruse strategies. They require something far earthier: skill.""

If it did, that could open the door for Iranian exports.  But on a prospective pipeline, there is nothing impracticable about its construction.

Geopolitics is often secondary to market forces at driving actions taken by any given market participants.

There are a million different proposed energy infrastructure projects that would connect sellers and buyers, most of which do not make economic sense and as a consequence, never get developed. Sending gas from Nigeria to Europe by pipeline is one of these. Getting gas from Turkmenistan and Israel to Europe are others. Sending gas from Iran to Europe is more realistic than some of these, but it has always been a difficult prospect.

First, there are sanctions on Iranian energy imports that would keep oil and gas from getting to European buyers under any circumstances. Even if this were alleviated, the risk would still be there. Second, Iranian gas wouldn't be very competitive, considering the distance it would need to travel and the infrastructure needed to support it. Iran already sells some gas to Turkey, and it's almost always outcompeted by Russian and Azeri gas. Russia never needed to step in and agree with Iran on anything to prevent Iran from entering the European market.

Yes.  This is one of several reasons why I recommend people (and Americans, specifically) follow diverse news sources, including those outside the United States.  American media simply do not cover all that matters in the world.  Even if they do, the way they cover what matters often is inadequate.  For example, Iran's move has been covered throughout the European press and elsewhere but it barely gets a mention even in Reuters.  Despite the fact that it's one of the most consequential developments to occur since Vladimir Putin began this unconscionable war in Ukraine. 

Another point of related consideration consideration relates to the echo chamber risk.  American media's coverage of international developments --- like the current mischief Iran is engaging in to support Vladimir Putin's regime --- is often superficially narrow, decontextualized and does not explain what these events mean in context or in the big picture.  Or when some of these types do weigh in, all of the perspectives that can be expressed fit between two fairly narrow poles.  But the rest of the world often sees things very differently.

Iran has the second-largest natural gas reserves in the world and is the world's third-largest producer. However, much of the production is devoted to [domestic consumption.](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=50276)  What small amounts Iran does export is it does so through pipelines to neighboring countries like Turkey, Iraq, and Armenia.  At the [moment these pipelines are still in testing phase](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20220129-limited-gas-flow-test-starts-from-iran-to-turkey/). It also imports from Azerbaijan.

The problem with Iran's natural gas production is it is low, due to sanctions that have restricted technology to the sector and investment from European companies.

Sanctions do not prevent Europeans from buying natural gas but have stopped investment to boost production and to build the pipelines to Europe. Iran needs about [US$80 Billion in investment](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/iran-says-its-natural-gas-sector-needs-80-billion-of-investment-1.1754257).

This is a better article by [Dr Umud Shokri](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20220322-iran-has-a-long-way-to-go-to-export-natural-gas-to-europe/) and according to this article

&gt;Iran's oil Minister says that, in recent years, the necessary investment has not been made in the oil and gas industry. On the other hand, to meet the needs of the country, Iran must invest $160 billion in this area. The decline in investment in Iran's oil and gas industry over the past decade, and the lack of participation of foreign companies in the development of fields have caused the country a deficit of 200 million cubic meters of gas per day; moreover, power plants and the industrial sector will have to use fuel oil instead of gas.

First. until Trump pulled the US out of JCPOA, all of the sanctions imposed on Iran had been done through the UNSC.  Even Russia and China signed off on it. For Russia, it is a good move, because it takes a competitor off the market.  People are quick to blame the West for the Iran sanctions, just like they are quick to blame them for Afghanistan, but both these two actions were approved by the UNSC.",98c184b7b6d0eb8a8ac068d0137bc3489912487a,True,False,,,,,0,1650525412,,0,{},i5l7vv1,False,t3_u7v0fh,False,True,t3_u7v0fh,/r/geopolitics/comments/u7v0fh/a_mighty_sword_irans_oil_caught_up_in_russian/i5l7vv1/,1650525422,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1650496612.0,

This has previous precedent, where under the fear American of sanctions, India has been forced to cut ties with Iran, with China emerging as the clear beneficiary. Meanwhile, there is no concern for India's sensitivities, whether it be national security (as seen in Afghanistan) or domestic stability (e.g., inflation due to oil prices).

Now, the same book is being applied primarily with regards to Russia, but also other countries like Myanmar. And while USA might think that they can get away with it simply because of their power, there will be a backlash from India sooner and later, and America might suffer for it.
