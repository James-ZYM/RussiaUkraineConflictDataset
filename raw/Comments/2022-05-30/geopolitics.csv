However, compared to the US for example, China is in a very bad position because the US's population is still growing, while China's population is rapidly declining. Also, Taiwan is much more foreigner friendly and more likely to accept expats and such to bolster there workforce.

Well, actually, so is the way you argue. Part of your reasoning is to blame African countries for not addressing the resource scarcity/pollution that is the result of our own lifestyle in the West. If we lived like Africans, there probably wouldn't be a problem for the planet in the first place; the problem isn't the African way of life, it's the Western way of life, so let's address that instead. Besides, African countries have not screwed up the planet, and even if it is a global problem, I don't see why African countries should tackle it to satisfy Western entitlements? Africa has a population density 2 times lower than Europe, and 3 times lower than Asia. If there are overpopulated continents that are a problem for the planet, it is mostly the latter. Of course, there are other very good reasons for these countries to try to lower their birth rate.

  
In any case, we will need African immigrants in 30 years anyway to avoid a recession due to the lower than replacement fertility rate in the West.

I argue that China wants to shift as much load as possible from sea routes to land routes, to circumvent US dominance of the oceans. This project, however, will not only bring advantages to China, but also challenges, as she is forced to permanently have the transit countries (mainly Kazakhstan and Russia, especially the first) on her side.

In your opinion, if savages entered the cities of Ukraine and killed civilians, raped women, oppressed civilians with tanks and tortured to death, is not genocide? It is also genocide. Unfortunately, this is not the end of the war. Between 22,000 and 27,000 civilians in Mariupol were killed in Russia. CONSCIOUSLY! I do not cite data on military losses. This is only confirmed data. Now there is an epidemic of so many corpses. After the arrival of savages in the city with a population of 467 thousand simply ceased to exist. Cities are extinct. Bucha, Irpin, Gostomel had a total population of more than 100 thousand. Okhtyrka (60k) was wiped from the face of the earth with phosphorus supplies. People from smaller cities and villages are simply disappearing. Now these cities no longer exist. The same with Chernihiv, Sumy and Kharkiv regions. There is no information on the occupied territories yet. Kherson became three times smaller. Mobile crematoria are working and mass graves are being dug. This is a real genocide. If you add up the number of dead, there will also be big numbers. We are waiting for the end of the war to prevent manipulation.  
  
Ukrainians are fighting genocide right now, stopping the savages  
occupiers.  
  
Let me remind you that in 1932-33 the USSR alone killed 4 to 10 million Ukrainians (the Holodomor https://holodomormuseum.org.ua/ru/ystoryia-holodomora/), shot all the intelligentsia and tortured the remaining camps throughout its existence during red terror.  
  
**Genocide is the deliberate action to destroy** *(Genocide is about action, not quantity)*, in whole or in part, groups of peoples or nations based on national, ethnic, racial, selfish or religious motives. It is horrible and it is impossible to compare the number of victims and the peoples affected by it. Your thesis about the quantity devalues all the genocides that have unfortunately happened in the history of many nations. Under Mao Zedong killed from 10 to 45 million.  
6 million Jews were killed during the Holocaust. We do not have to compare the number of victims. We must condemn and respond strongly to such savagery, no matter when or with whom it occurs. Your outrage should be directed at what is happening that is genocide, not wait until it is even more catastrophic. 

The genocide is taking place right now in the occupied territories. As was the case during the Russian-Ukrainian war. And I will remind you: 8 years. On the territory of the occupied Crimea, the Russians are killing the Tatar Majilis. Ukrainians have been exterminated in Donetsk and Luhansk region for 8 years. And now they continue.

I have to disagree with this. Debt is only not a problem if its funding productive growth. If the debt is funding unproductive growth then it becomes as issue. 

And I think there is some evidence that a lot of the debt has gone into a local over investment in infrastructure in order to meet economic growth totals set by the central government. 

Infrastructure is great if it leads to future economic activity, but there's a thresh-hold you can cross where you're only creating marginal future economic activity, which creates immediate GDP growth, but does not create enough future growth to justify the cost.

On the negative side, I think it's fair to ask questions about what the future of China's economy looks like. They have one of the most rapidly aging populations and while their GDP growth prior to the early 2000's was driven mostly by filling a clear need in the world economy for inexpensive and productive outsourced labor, their growth since then has been  driven more by a rapid increase in total debt.

Investors don't need to be sure that a market will last for thirty years.
