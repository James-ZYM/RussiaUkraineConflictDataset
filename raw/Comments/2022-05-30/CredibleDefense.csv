[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"&gt;Would a t34 be better than no tank?

Yes, because the mission and situation, including enemy, dictates what is needed. The Russians need to defend the territory they have against UAF mechanized assaults that will be done by tanks and IFV, supported by lots of artillery. They need APC and IFV for their infantry and recon and engineers, but they need tanks too because a tank main gun can go things that a APC or IFV heavy machine gun or light cannon can't do. 

UAF ATGMs are largely a defensive weapon, they are meant for AT ambushes not for aggressively attacking unless we're talking about vehicle mounted ones. And those will kill anything the Russians have to to updated T-72 anyway. If the UAF get TOW-2B then nothing they have survives that, nor can much they had before stop the T-64s main gun. 

So in terms of Russians on the defensive, what is needed in armor is enough to survive the stuff that existing armor could shrug off, which was mostly APC and IFV light cannons and maybe some HEAT depending on applique armor type (ERA mostly). At the very least even a T-34 is better armored than BMP, BMD, and BTR that the Russians absolutely rely on too, and we're not exactly faulting them for using those vehicles to move troops just because they're incredibly vulnerable right?

Even a T-34 brings a gun that can kill UAF APCs and IFV and dismounted infantry, and can blow the shit out of cover if they're att attacking. It's got the tactical mobility to make it better than wheeled vehicles. It's downside is fire control, it's basically useless unless it's the day and then it'll be slow to find targets and inaccurate too.

Which is why a T-62M can be more useful. It's way better than the T-34 in every way, its gun can kill everything up to T-64, and its armor is better too than the T-34 or accompanying APC and IFV..

If you're a Russian trying to use a limited number of AT weapons to take on a UAF.

&gt;lot of trouble to make sure your troops die inside a tank and not a BMP.

Then I suggest you read up on the post-cold war environment and the numerous security fears that plagued the State Dept and Pentagon throughout the 1990s.

&gt;A collapse in this case may mean something like a palace coup

Ah yes, another ill-defined coup where we roll the dice and hope for the best in Russia. The assumption that this will result in a favourable outcome is based on two faulty premises:

1. But for Putin, Russia would have a peaceful policy towards Ukraine. I suspect that the US establishment views Putin as fundamentally antagonistic following the 2016 election interference. It's abundantly clear that America would rather deal with anyone but Putin. That being said, the status of post-cold war Ukraine has been a considerable area of conjecture *since the 1990s.* To quote Bill Burr on this exact issue: *“Ukrainian entry into NATO is the brightest of all redlines for the Russian elite (not just Putin). In more than two and a half years of conversations with key Russian players, from knuckle-draggers in the dark recesses of the Kremlin to Putin’s sharpest liberal critics, I have yet to find anyone who views Ukraine in NATO as anything other than a direct challenge to Russian interests.”* 
2. That there exists some sort of politically powerful liberal reform element within Russia ready to take on Putin. I find this entire premise doubtful to say the least. Who would replace Putin? Who would have the backing of the military and oligarchs? The opposite of autocracy is typically not liberalism, but rather chaos. Wishful thinking that a palace coup would result in an immediate withdrawal from Ukraine and reintegration of Russia into the western sphere as a liberal democracy is not based in anything close to reality. 

&gt;The suggestion that the world should abandon Ukraine so that this regime can continue is what is actually being suggested. That sets the same precedent as Chechnya, Georgia, Crimea... Austria, Western Poland..

This is simply not true. Very few (if any) are calling for the wholesale abandonment of Ukraine. We must, however, continue to balance our own interests and strategic desires with those of Ukraine. How does it help the West, exactly, to foment a palace coup in Russia?",3bed0de39500f73c21fca290df8da19a2b2dd36d,True,False,,,,,0,1653947050,,0,{},ialb83p,False,t3_v0ymyc,False,True,t1_ial9gld,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v0ymyc/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_30_2022/ialb83p/,1653947065,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653918250.0,

Mind you the counter offensive for Donbas, if it ever happens, will require a lot of heavy weapons ( tanks, MLRS, artilleries, drones, etc. ) and the Ukrainian armed forces should expect high casualties as well as Russia will not lose that war easily as Putin’s regime depends on it. 

For now, causing as much casualties on Russian forces as possible seems to be a viable tactic. Russia couldn’t produce tanks, missiles, and aerial vehicles because of the sanction imposed by the west, which is crucial because Russian vehicles need those parts to operate at the highest efficacy ( thermal optics, computer chip, etc. ) According to the data I’ve found few days ago, Russia couldn’t even build that much prior.

Dam, we keep coming back to this.

Would a t34 be better than no tank? What about a t26? Ad Tsar tank? At some point,  you got to realise that there are better options than no tanks at all. 

I might be out of my depth here, but in a modern battlefront with tons of ATGMs, I'd imagine lacking any kind of modern fire controls and a radio you can use without being detected all the way from Paris would probably be what settles that line.

Except the emphasis is on the paired computer assisted optics with networked target marking among rifles (pretty insane). I think the general strategy is to get more accurate rounds on target and have those rounds be lethal at longer ranges (if needed). The 6.8 rounds has more range, less drift, less drop, and more energy at the 500m and beyond. A rifleman can mark a target on his scope and that mark will show up in the optic of the M250 LMG gunner. Less time, more accurate, deadly rounds on target with less ammunition needed. A trained experienced solider learns when suppressive fire is close or not and will continue to engage. That same solider will take cover if the rounds are landing on-top of him.

I think the bigger concern is moving to a new round that is NOT NATO standard.

The resolution, adopted under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter:

demands the immediate establishment of a ceasefire and a complete end to violence and all attacks against, and abuses of, civilians;
imposes a no-fly zone over Libya;
authorizes ""all necessary measures [...] to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, including Benghazi, while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan territory"";
strengthens the arms embargo and particularly action against mercenaries, by allowing for forcible inspections of ships and planes;
imposes a ban on all Libyan-designated flights;
imposes an asset freeze on assets owned by the Libyan authorities, and reaffirms that such assets should be used for the benefit of the Libyan people;
extends the travel ban and assets freeze of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1970 to a number of additional individuals and Libyan entities;
establishes a panel of experts to monitor and promote sanctions implementation.

If you take away from that text anything other than the resolution would weaken Gaddafi's ability to wage war (when he's **in** a war against someone who wants to overthrow him), you're an idiot.  So either you're calling Putin an imbecile or you're wrong, I'll let you choose.

&gt;So, there is already a precedent that Russia (via its Soviet past) can win a determined proxy war against us.

Oh, I thought that might be what you meant but it was so inane that I thought I'd ask you to clarify before going in.  It's my turn to spell something out:

Russia is not the soviet union.  Not even close.  That war demonstrated that in brutal detail.  Russia is going to continue pursuing foreign policy as a regional power, but any new cold war they try to start will end about the same way the previous did, and it's better to let them know that sooner rather than later.

&gt;BTW, you do know what the #1 reason for our getting involved in South Vietnam was, right? It was to avoid a humiliating US defeat (to our reputation as a guarantor), or in other words, to prove that ""Russia the Soviet Union can't win a determined proxy war against us so it should stop trying.""

Because if the end result is Russia still gets what they want, what they'll take away from it is even if NATO does try, they can't stop it.

Russia wanted to install a puppet government in kyiv. I'm pretty sure they won't get that. Whatever they do get from this (if any) will have had a huge cost, not to mention the future cost of sanctions. Russians are not retarded or delusional, they won't simply ignore this costs in the future like they could ignore the almost inexistent cost of the 2014 adventure. 

&gt;wh... isn't that literally what we're talking about? That's what I'm suggesting.

You're suggesting the west try to beat some sense into Russian mentality by making sure it looses the war (however you define that). 

What I propose is that the west supports Ukraine to keep winning until they force the Russians to make an acceptable deal (keep in mind that can even mean a complete retake of territory until the Russians give up, unlikely) that both parties  can agree and them keep supporting Ukraine into making itself uninvadable. 

The fundamental difference is that saying that russia must ""loose"" doesn't really translate into an actionable plan and creates the risk of prolonging the war beyond what even Ukraine would like to.",2c9e1e7ed75f013f77313226da52e91ee7fccc12,True,False,,,,,0,1653941374,,0,{},iakzf6y,False,t3_v0ymyc,False,True,t1_iakxu5b,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v0ymyc/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_30_2022/iakzf6y/,1653941390,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653912574.0,

While it was still a fraction of those that started the battle they still didn't fight to the end there or elsewhere. 

The conclusion is either they weren't committed enough to fight to the end (almost certainly not true) or more likely they never actually intended to fight to the death, all the public claims were part of an information operation done by the field commanders and the MOD to bluff the Russians, all in a concerted plan to fight the longest resistance they could without it actually being suicidal, in order to draw Russian troops and resources to that fight versus somewhere else. Once they were surrendered defeat was imminent, but by not immediately surrendering they bled the Russians hard.

Ergo, the UAF ain't the IJA or ISIS. They're not going to do it, they'll only go so far as is sensible to carry out the mission. And them having a defensive advantage only helps if one assumes the Russians will play along.

That worked in Mariupol because by the time the Russians had strategically realized that the Ukrainians weren't fucking around they were already committed to attacking and clearing the city, which meant if they stopped to only lay siege to it they'd have been viewed as losing that battle. So they had to bite the bullet and clear it no matter what. 

Now that isn't a factor. They will know going in how the Ukrainians are capable of resisting. And between Mariupol and the grinding actions in the current Donbas offensive they don't have any further proof they are brave and ruthless, so they can decide to lay siege without looking weak. 

So that's two reasons right there not to do it. Not even considering how much safer it is for the Russians not to attack to reduce any encircled forces, or the insanity of UAF voluntarily throwing away the better part of 10k highly experienced and useful ground troops and all their equipment, but an untold number of civilians too, for a mission that they don't benefit from at all.",2c71896d64592cc5141d3368f3df76d382a90283,True,False,,,,,0,1653941366,,0,{},iakzekt,False,t3_v0ymyc,False,True,t1_iakd8pm,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v0ymyc/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_30_2022/iakzekt/,1653941382,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653912566.0,

I don't think it's that debatable.  Putin has since before the conflict even began in no uncertain terms said that he views this as a proxy war with the west.  Notice how all of the grievances he listed before sending his tanks into Kyiv were aimed at countries that aren't Ukraine?  And his propagandists are further selling a cinematic universe where America is treating Ukraine like south vietnam, that there are brigades of marines on the ground and that a tomahawk missile blew up the Mosvka etc etc.

And I just re-read the article (I've seen it before), and you're gonna have to elaborate what part comes off as saying ""Russia does not see Ukraine as a western ally"".

The way I see it the article says ""Russia's only functional long term solution is dismantling the Ukrainian state"" which plays into my point.

Pretty sure the only way to interpret that (completely vindicated) take is ""Russia sees the current Ukrainian government and people as being on a terminal westward course that cannot be tolerated nor can it be stopped short of total war"".

Afghanistan, for example, saw Russians pretty much stick to bounties on US troops and likely some minor covert assistance. Even in Syria, Russia has been reluctant to provide anti-air systems to the Assad regime. 

Now all of these are individual cases that have *very* good reasons (e.g., in Syria Russia wants to refrain from antagonizing Israel while supporting one of their main adversaries - a delicate balance), but after Ukraine I believe the gloves are off for two reasons:

1. Lack of escalatory options for the US and NATO. What are they going to do? Sanction Russia more? Sure there are options, but most of them are so high up the escalation ladder, it makes little sense.

[],False,,evo_help93,,,[],,,,text,t2_iul8dbh4,False,False,"&gt;If this ends up as a frozen conflict ala Korea, would that possibly have a dampening effect on weapons proliferation?

Great question. I think the key point here is what the economic status of Ukraine is in a frozen conflict where their main export terminal is still blockaded. There's too many unknowns to say for sure, but imagine a scenario in which Ukraine, locked in a frozen war with a failing economy, with waning support from the West, has little economic prospects. In that scenario. I can see locals, commanders far away from the front, and other individuals making the decision to sell weapons to survive. This is, incidentally, why I think it's *critical* we establish some sort of Ukrainian support fund that has multi-year financing (conditional of course). 

&gt;How bad was weapons proliferation after the Korean War settled down along the 38th parallel?

This is a great question and something I will probably spend my free time looking into today. I suspect Korea's geography and strong centralized power structure (as well as continued assistance from the Soviets and the USA) dampened this but that's just a guess on my part. 

&gt;Are you imagining a situation in which the conflict is won and the decentralized command structure leads to multiple separate loci of political influence within Ukraine? How would a frozen conflict situation affect this dynamic?

This is one possibility, but another one that I don't think has ben thought of by many is that the East / West divide in Ukraine is still fairly stark. It's not just a pro-russia / anti-russia divide, it's urban vs rural, conservative vs liberal, multi-cultural vs ethnic nationalists, all wrapped into one in a series of criss-crossing and overlapping identities. What happens if Zelensky, facing pressure from the urban elite in Kyiv / Lviv, signs a peace treaty that sells out portions of Eastern Ukraine (you can say ""he would never do this"" but it's *possible).* What happens to the embittered, heavily armed veterans of the fighting in the East when they go to Kyiv and Lviv after the war and see relative prosperity, little damage, and a society that has forced their Eastern brothers to pay the brunt of the cost of the war?

It's not impossible to see how this could create domestic political turmoil and when you add decentralized command and an influx of weaponry (as well as the natural tendency of states to deteriorate when fighting existential wars) and you have the potential for a very dangerous situation.",5e0ebc4fbd8b35fd238e318ae455f095ddc8ca4a,True,False,,,,,0,1653934889,,0,{},iakli26,False,t3_v0ymyc,False,True,t1_iaki6ty,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v0ymyc/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_30_2022/iakli26/,1653934906,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653906089.0,

It is unlikely that relations could ever be the same with Putin still in charge in Russia. And pushing hard to have him removed creates significant dangers, as the author points out. 

--------------

*Attention is concentrated on the risk that the war launched by Russia against Ukraine could escalate to a nuclear exchange. That risk exists but appears to be relatively low. There is another danger, however, which has so far remained unnoticed: the risk of nuclear war may sharply increase after the war ends depending on Western policies towards Russia. Under some versions of “regime change” policies, the risk of escalation may grow to an unacceptable level.*

&gt; * Facing conditions of uncertainty concerning Russia’s red lines, the West has had to proceed, literally, by trial and error, always unsure about what might trigger an escalation.

&gt; * In a way, the availability of long-range conventional weapons makes escalation of the war in Ukraine to a NATO-Russia conflict more likely because these weapons are perceived by both sides as usable, in contrast to nuclear weapons.

&gt; * After active fighting ends, the West will need to decide what to do with or, more properly, to Russia. Without doubt, return to the status quo ante is impossible.

&gt; * The West, however, will face a major choice: whether to limit its pressure on Russia to isolation or press for a regime change.

&gt; * An attempt at a wholesale regime change and outside control fits into the official red line for nuclear use as defined in the 2014 Military Doctrine: “When the very survival of the state is under threat.”

&gt; * Even an anti-government and/or pro-democracy popular movement along the lines of the 2011 demonstrations would likely also be anti-Western. According to the only remaining independent Russian polling service, Levada Center, the vast majority of Russians support war in Ukraine and adhere to a negative view of the West, treating it as hostile.

&gt; * To make this perspective acceptable to the Russian public, it should be endorsed by non-Western countries that are perceived as more neutral and objective, such as China or India. Russians would likely reject a purely Western effort.

&gt; * With sovereignty at stake, the scenario for conflict will be different from the one described above. The conventional phase will be short, if it exists, while escalation to the nuclear stage will be more likely. This will not necessarily imply full-scale nuclear war, though, at least initially.

&gt; * Three options for Russia appear possible, depending on how strong Western pressure will be:
* 
* An underground nuclear test.
* 
* A “demonstration” explosion over an uninhabited area (such as the Arctic).
* 
* Limited – perhaps single – use against a high-value non-military target in a non-nuclear NATO state. The choice of the target will depend on which country is seen as being at the forefront of efforts to strangle Russia.

&gt; * A potentially more dangerous situation may arise after the war ends. Much will depend on the decisions the West will make with respect to its longer-term policy toward Russia. 

&gt; * …it would be dangerous to assume that nuclear weapons cannot be used outside war conditions.

Probably the best solution here is to give Ukraine enough weapons that they decisively kick Russia out of their country, and then follow it up with a Marshall plan to rebuild their economy and integrate them into the EU.

But another good solution would be to keep track of the western weapons by sending western soldiers with them who can operate and keep track of them. I'm open to that as well if trusting the Ukrainians is too risky.

Take claims of sensationalism for example. It has being defended as a boon instead of a vice before. To quote Sylvester Bolam..

""The Mirror is a sensational newspaper. We make no apology for that. We believe in the sensational presentation of news and views, especially important news and views, as a necessary and valuable public service in these days of mass readership and democratic responsibility … Sensationalism does not mean distorting the truth. It means the vivid and dramatic presentation of events so as to give them a forceful impact on the mind of the reader. It means big headlines, vigorous writing, simplification into familiar everyday language, and the wide use of illustration by cartoon and photograph."" 

I'm not saying sensationalism is good. I am saying its not enough to evoke the term you need to argue why a certain piece is bad.

Want to source that? Because a lot of this sounds like platitudes and axioms, and platitudes and axioms don't win wars by themselves.

Because I don't think there's much relevance to that psychologically to a ""real"" war - and on top of that, [SOF veterans in Ukraine](https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/23/europe/ukraine-us-soldier-irpin-intl-cmd/index.html) talk of how the war is nothing like anything they experienced. That it is way more intense.

To say nothing about the scars of our conflicts on our psychologly - how many of our best and brightest are now leaving because they are fed up with our defense strategy, hate the bullshit being fed by top brass, etc. - I mean hey, people on the ground were screaming about Afghanistan falling apart yet it was all sunshine and rainbows at the top... until it wasn't

And morale wise, our retention numbers speak for themselves: our experienced NCOs and junior officers are fleeing for the hills. We're danging bonuses in the tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars to try to keep them - and yet the Air Force is [over a thousand pilots short.](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/us-air-force-short-thousands-pilots-2100-be-exact-129657)

&gt; Also none of those Russian conflicts had any kind of scale to them in comparison

If that were the case, then Iraq in 1991 - after nearly a decade of large scale war against Iran with a battle hardened NCO corps - should have put up far more of a fight against a US-led coalition with no relevant combat experience, with leaders that last fought as junior officers in a failed counter insurgency.

The fact is, none of our recent conflicts can be compared to a major war. The last people to have experience with that were junior officers and junior enlisted at the start of OIF - and that was against a nation that had no chance at fighting back.

Russia rotated forces through Syria to get combat experience for years - as the US did in Afghanistan (we joked that it was a graduation exercise)

Again, how many pilots in the US have had experience with 60+ plane strikes against a high-end adversary? How many have conducted an actual maritime strike?

None. But again, that's we do training exercises all the time - because there is no substitute short of an actual high-end war, and because combat time logged over Afghanistan or Iraq aren't substitutes either

&gt; and, as always, the US pushes our logistical experience in confronting far away ""threats"" and that will always be our biggest advantage in any peer conflict imo.

Yes, logistically we were moving troops to the Middle East using pre-staged equipment and bases with near absolute security.

The issue is that we didn't replenish those logistical forces materially (have you seen the age and state of some of our replenishment vessels?), those forces were staged in the absolute security of major US bases dotted across the Middle East (how's our logistics look if our replenishment ships can be sunk and our bases can be hit?), and we're going to be pushing into someone's backyard where their entire combat forces can be arrayed from land or coastal areas less than 2,000 miles wide while we are largely confined to a few islands and naval vessels (so our material state matters a lot)",e9798b73c9ceb86c8a5404483382f3f2cd1c6943,True,False,,,,,0,1653929849,,0,{},iaka7fd,False,t3_v0t24u,False,True,t1_iak6ukh,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v0t24u/using_the_enemy_to_train_the_troopsbeijings_new/iaka7fd/,1653929861,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653901049.0,

On the one hand, the conflict was at its most quiet since it began in 2014, at least going by the number of civilian casualties. It is also unlikely Ukraine would have enjoyed the same level of international support, had Russia pushed back in that scenario, even if it's their land de jure, and all.   

But on the other hand, it's clear now that Ukrainian forces would have wiped the floor with the L/DNR militia, not leaving Russia much time to react. Zelensky also did a 180 after nationalists started protesting against his peacemaking efforts, and assumed a more confrontational position, which was potentially a signal that he'd opted for retaking the land by force. Zelensky was also very unpopular before the war (his approval was at around the 20% mark), a victory in Donbass would have earned him a lot of support, or at the very least would have distracted the population from other problems.

I don't know why people keep bringing this up, but Russia was in a real conflict in Syria, Ukraine, and Georgia the past decade and a half - and look at them now.

Also, ""real shape"" ?

The US has spent the past 20+ years in various forms of conflict, and yet:

* Decades worth of resources were diverted from necessary programs for the high-end fight
* Said decades worth of fighting has diverted resources away. [Our carrier force](https://news.usni.org/2020/11/12/no-margin-left-overworked-carrier-force-struggles-to-maintain-deployments-after-decades-of-overuse), for instance, has been so overworked and overused that it can't keep up with maintenance. In 2019, for instance, the USS Abraham Lincoln was the only deployable carrier out of a force of 11 carriers. 
* The maintenance issues extend to aircraft as well, [where readiness rates](https://www.airforcemag.com/fighter-mission-capable-rates-fell-in-2021/) of aircraft in the AF, Navy, and Marines are all well below the desired marks.
* Retention is horrendous in the US military - [experienced combat proven pilots](https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2021/04/usafs-bad-bets-pilot-retention-show-it-needs-outside-help/173431/) being the most obvious, but now services are dangling [major bonsues](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2022/04/22/dozens-of-air-force-and-space-force-jobs-now-eligible-reenlistment-bonuses.html) for enlisted ranks too (guess we're having a hard time keeping those good NCOs around huh?). Hmm, turns out years of war, constant deployments, and never ending work ups for said deployments sends your best and brightest runnig for the hill

If this is what a military in ""real shape"" is like....oof. 

Also, do you think there's much combat relevance between fighting a bunch of insurgencies in a low end conflict and fighting in a high tech fight?

Most of my combat hours were spent in a CAS stack under little to no threat from any enemy. 

How relevant do you think that is to fighting a war at sea with 60+ aircraft airborne and an enemy that can reach you from over hundreds of miles away?

There's a reason the US has exercises like Red Flag to train for complex and advanced war scenarios. Or large theater exercises to handle the levels above the tactical ones.

Adan was involved in operational and staff commands concerned with the Sinai lines after 1967.  He explicitly states that following the failure of Nasser’s War of Attrition, and his subsequent death, Sadat and his new DefMin designed a military force that could breach the 3 lines of Israeli forces and make a limited advance into the Eastern Sinai.  The aim was political, nor strictly military.  One part of this was to bolster, withSoviet arms, the two areas of greatest mismatch in the 1967 War;  Israeli superiority in armor and air.  Part of the comprehensive plan developed was to use overlapping munitions for antitank and anti air.  
Adan is good on both the Israeli experiences and processes that led to the three lines of defense.  He is also good  in a separate chapter reconstructing (from captured documents ) the reciprocal nature of Arab and Israeli planning as various stratagems were tried by both sides.  
At the time of war, 1100 on 6/10/73, Israel had a qualitative advantage in terms of overall competency in Air and Armor.  On the narrower issue of actual numbers, the Israelis had more top echelon armor and more  high quality aviation.   To offset these advantages the Arabs spent much time and effort building up the West Bank of the Suez and structured forces explicitly to take advantage of Israel’s purposely thin front line (the maozim, or strong points) , and to be able to attack broadly enough to offset the mobility advantages of the Israeli 2nd line (the artillery road) and the 3rd line (armor and mechanized infantry.  Consistent with the constraints in Israeli society and the structure of an IDF reliant on reserve forces, the numbers of Israeli troops and equipment at the time of the attack were certainly smaller than the 2nd and 3rd Armies of Egypt.  But that was by design; the Israelis thought they would have some intelligence warning and had already designated reserve forces and some additional regular forces to augment the border lines.

Take a look at the DNR/LNR mobilized infantry, with their Mosins and no training. Could it be that they are being sent to the front to die on purpose? Or is it that this is simply the best quality of leadership that the completely rotten system can produce?

The Russian MoD has not been publishing losses for 2 months now (and those numbers don't even include separatists, Rosgvardia, or PMC).

It's a flaw of Russian doctrine, they LOVE broad front attacks because it tricks the enemy into not knowing where the main effort it, it forces the defenders to spread out to defend everything, and it acts as a reconnaissance in force to find defensive weak points. But it only works when the attacker dramatically outnumbers the defender, and it violates a principle of war by purposely dispersing combat power. Was the Russian western axis from Popasna necessary? Did the BTGs involved in that thrust end up not helping the BTGs that went north to cut the two MSRs?

Also, as the breakthrough occurred the Ukrainians likely were both counterattacking and reinforcing that area with everything they got because of the importance, if cut the battle is lost.

If it really was such, they wouldn’t let their security posture be this degraded, that would be suicidal if it was an actual Cold War type scenario where they feared NATO rolling into the country right now in the same way the west feared the soviets rolling across Europe from the east.

It absolutely amazes me that people really believe that.

If they had succeeded the world would have in short order woken up to a union state of russo-Belorussian-Ukrainian basis.

This would have been connected to transnistria which they’d have soon absorbed by staging a referendum. 
And they could easily have taken over Moldova in a month, the troops would have just kept rolling..

After that they’d simply formally annex South Ossetia and Abkhazia and then commit the billions they spent in covert operations in Ukraine to operations in Georgia And using the new power and intimidation and seeming invincible could likely have forced Georgia into the union lest they get a repeat of 2008 and they’d feel hopeless especially from memories and because Ukraine would have just been steamrolled.

Just like that the entire world would wake to s mafia kleptocratic mockery of the previous USSR.

Putin would be smug and victorious about his legacy and the amount of repression and violence he’d enact to solidify his gains would be untold since the mistakes of the USSRs collapse would be something he’d learn from.

Yes. Because they don't have enough of newer stuff.

This doesn't mean they literally have 0 T-72s in storage.

The most Russia-optimistic interpretation is that there are different storage facilities, each able to restore some number of tanks per month. And likely some of the storage facilities are out of newer stuff and are now restoring T-62s, while others still have decent supply of restorable T-72s for a few more months.

Not only that, but by leaving open supply routes they prevent the material and reinforcements from being stockpiled in the west for a counterattack or to potentially hold out if/when the fighting reaches the Dnieper.  Currently it is being destroyed in a favorable situation in the Donbass rather than being accumulated.  The recent Kherson offensive fizzled pretty quickly because the Ukrainians are forced to constantly push more troops and equipment into the Donbass and the deteriorating situation there is forcing premature attacks that are meant to offset, in terms of propaganda at least, the defeats in the east.

Effectively the Donbass is a firesack and the more men and equipment that can be lured into fighting there the better for the attritional strategy the Russians are running.  Plus in the Donbass the Russians can make use of the Donbass militias to do the fighting; once the fight moves beyond that region the militias won't be available in significant numbers, as the fighters aren't going to be willing or able to fight outside their regions.  So best to destroy the Ukrainian forces and equipment in the most favorable logistical circumstances for the Russians and Russian allied forces and the least favorable ones for the Ukrainians.

Understand that the Russians are running this slow for a reason and that isn't because they are weak.  They realize this is a war of attrition and morale and are aiming to outlast not just Ukraine's will and ability to fight, but also that of Europe and America.  The longer this grinds on the more interest Americans lose in the war due to domestic issues and the harder this becomes on Europe's economy as well as politics, which is leading to fractures that Russia can exploit.  For all the issues this is causing to Russia economically, politically this is only uniting Russia under Putin while strengthening the value of Russia's strategic assets (energy) and increasing revenues from exports, while keeping more money in the economy due to lack of imports and helping facilitate the development of domestic production.  

Long run autarky is actually strengthening the Russian economy, but the public wouldn't have gone for it without this being forced on them; by keeping the war going this gives Putin the political opportunity to divest from the west economically and in the long run ensure that Russia cannot be damaged by sanctions.  Independence economically, despite the theoretically inefficiencies, gives major political freedom and ensures domestic jobs as there so the rising middle class/youth doesn't immigrate.  People in the west may not realize just how many people have left Russia since the 2014 sanctions started due to the economic downturn; this war continuing makes it harder for them to leave, but also lets new industries be developed which ensures that when this ends that even with sanctions continuing there will be lucrative jobs to keep the younger generations tied to the country instead of seeking fortune in the west.  Plus if Europe is economically stunted by the war and lack of access to cheap Russian energy there is less incentive for Russians to move west for work.  Same in the US, which is hitting recession.  

Though it is a long way to answer your question, the strategic/grand strategic game being played is facilitated by the war continuing for a while which means keeping open some Ukrainian supply lines while Russia squeezes the AFU in the Donbass like a Boa Constrictor.  It is breaking the will of Ukraine and its allies to continue the war by making them fight an unwinnable campaign in very unfavorable circumstances.",ee58f8eaf6fd774ef1532ba99fa5c2281a73c2d0,True,False,,,,,0,1653908686,,0,{},iaj5y3s,False,t3_v09pc3,False,True,t1_iaisvz9,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v09pc3/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_29_2022/iaj5y3s/,1653908698,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653879886.0,

I do know many of the people in each of these groups. And each of them are required for the society to survive.

What I do not currently get is the fact that Olaf Scholz holds back so much. Either he is in the russian pockets or he is just incompetent.

Initially I understand that Russia would have preferred to keep them intact, on the assumption that the quick decapitation strike to Kiev was successful and the entirety of Ukraine would be annexed or put under a puppet government.

However after the failure of that plan and the downgrade of war aims to the east and south of Ukraine, surely these bridges must be an enormously valuable target. 

Destruction or damage of especially the rail crossings would play havoc with Ukrainian logistics in the east and impede flow of supplies to the area of heaviest fighting.

As far as I've seen however, the Russians haven't even attempted to blow them up despite using hundreds of cruise missiles throughout the war, including on ostensibly low value targets like shopping malls and pig farms.

One theory I heard from Michael Kofman was that the status of the war as a 'special military operation' precludes the Russians from attacking civilian infrastructure like bridges. This seems unlikely to me, and in fact the bridge near Zakota over the Dniester has been struck repeatedly, showing that the Russians don't seem to have any such qualms.

So why not the strategically vital crossings over the Dnieper? Are they simply unable to hit the targets? Are they not targeting them, and if not, why not? Or do the Ukrainians have concentrated AA assets nearby that have so far shot down every missile fired at them? None of these seems likely to me.

One of my least favorite news phrasing. Quietly implies deception, or a desire to go unnoticed. It only makes sense if changes to these doctrines are typically announced, otherwise by definition any change is “quiet”. 

I can see why the idea might be attractive from a nationalist perspective, and certain types of border testing might give you data, e.g. aircraft response times, but I’m not sure I see useful training data coming from naval shenanigans in this scenario, purely because the supposed enemy knows that you aren’t going to attack and is therefore going to behave very differently from in a warfare situation.

Plus, if you’re close enough to them to “train” on them, aren’t you also giving them first row seats to your training exercises, and giving them the opportunity to do the same? 

Seems like a way to turn the usual games of chicken into a more noble pursuit, particularly when you have phrases like this:

&gt; PLA commentators often highlight the existence of a “peace disease” (和平积弊, heping jibi or 和平病, heping bing) within the ranks, and they see close contact with the enemy as one way of treating this malady.

*‘China in mind’: Japan mulls beefing up military as Ukraine war rings alarm*

Country could double spending and acquire ‘first-strike’ capability in shift away from defensive postwar posture

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/30/japan-china-defence-ukraine-war-russia?CMP=share_btn_tw

&gt; * Yet it is under Kishida, and not his hawkish predecessor, Shinzo Abe, that Japan is undergoing a dramatic shift in its strictly defensive postwar posture in which the country could double spending on its military and edge closer to acquiring a “first-strike” capability.

&gt; * Eight months into his term of office, Kishida faces unprecedented foreign policy challenges. Russia’s war in Ukraine has set alarm bells ringing in the Asia Pacific region about the potential for a copycat Chinese invasion of Taiwan, a self-governing democracy that Beijing regards as a renegade province that will one day be reunited with the motherland.

&gt; * ...last month in a party commission proposal to increase spending on the military from 1% to 2% or more of GDP over the next five years. Japan, Kawasaki points out, has the third largest GDP in the world.

&gt; * “Whether Japanese politicians or the public want it or not, Tokyo will have to shoulder more security responsibility in the region...

&gt; * A recent opinion poll by the Asahi Shimbun and Tokyo University reflects unease in Japan following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The survey found that a record 64% were in favour of bolstering Japan’s defences and only 10% against. A Yomiuri Shimbun survey, however, found respondents were split down the middle at 46% each on the merits of acquiring the ability to strike enemy bases.",c6dc3004e520bcb03776d58016e24efca3f1f6d8,True,False,,,,,0,1653891020,,0,{},iailkz3,True,t3_v0t24u,False,True,t3_v0t24u,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v0t24u/using_the_enemy_to_train_the_troopsbeijings_new/iailkz3/,1653891033,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653862220.0,

Interesting topic, but one that is fraught, I'm afraid, with both ontological and epistemological issues, which is often elided in essays like this and, more worryingly, in analyses like the one the essay deals with.

Thus, for example, when an assessment is made of a ""foreign"" leader, note that there is an ""othering"" that takes place. Put differently, the emphasis is on the ""foreignness"" of the leader. This, naturally, is inevitable. But this also brings in its wake the question regarding how this ""other"" views and interprets the world.

Now, the most common option is to cast the ""other"" (as the ""other"", i.e., as a ""foreigner"") within the same conceptual and analytical framework within which we exist. This helps us to establish frames of reference within which ""the other"" is made intelligible and thus we can proceed to deduce ""the other's rationality"". But this system requires a reduction of ""the other"". Alternately, we leave ""the other"" out and review his/her actions and cast that within our own analytical framework.

Take, for example, the notions of ""victory"" and ""defeat"". How do we understand this in strategic-political terms? Can we say that we all share a sort of universal understanding of these two terms? Or, are the notions of ""victory"" and ""defeat"" contingent on our specific ethno-cultural backgrounds? Another example is the question of ""ethics"" and ""morals"". And, equally important is the conceptualization and understanding of key concepts such as ""time"", ""space"", ""power"" etc.

This is a real problem when trying to assess ""foreign"" leaders and the decisions that they make. Of course, there is some degree of recognition since such analyses cannot (or should not) take place divorced from the institutional and organisational context within which they are made but this is a flimsy scaffold.",70dd4e5ecbd914be58fcb01f36f94179596ee179,True,False,,,,,0,1653890299,,0,{},iaikmtv,False,t3_v0dl1d,False,True,t3_v0dl1d,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v0dl1d/assessing_how_the_us_intelligence_community/iaikmtv/,1653890315,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653861499.0,

------------

&gt; * The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has quietly changed the way it interacts with U.S. military forces in the Western Pacific. Instead of just tracking and monitoring U.S. ships and aircraft, demanding they leave sensitive areas, the PLA has embraced an approach that favors hostile encounters as preparation for future conflict with the United States. In PLA parlance, it is “using the enemy to train the troops”—nadi lianbing (拿敌练兵).

&gt; * This is not a new approach. The term nadi lianbing has appeared in PLA sources since 2014. However, recent statements by the Ministry of National Defense (MoD) indicate that it has become enshrined as doctrine.

&gt; * In his remarks, President Xi Jinping called for the PLA to realize a “transformation in military training.” This precipitated a greater emphasis on training in general, with a particular focus on “realistic” training that better approximates the conditions of actual combat with a likely adversary…

&gt; * According to PLAN leaders, nadi lianbing is a direct response to an uptick in provocative U.S. behavior along China’s maritime periphery. 

&gt; * With the passive approach, PLAN forces respond to provocative behavior by the enemy (因敌而动, yin di er dong), such as tactical exercises aimed at Chinese forces, taking steps short of kinetic force to defend against them. This approach likely involves all the skills required to thwart an attack, short of using force: e.g., intercepting inbound aircraft, maneuvering for tactical advantage, and perhaps jamming and other forms of electronic warfare.

&gt; * The second form involves proactively seeking out (依我而动, yi wo er dong) nearby enemy forces during regular missions and using interactions to serve training purposes. That is, deployed PLAN forces would target enemy ships, aircraft, and submarines to complete required individual training, platform training, group (module) training, and combined group training. According to Zhang Tianjing, PLAN forces will “conduct real reconnaissance, real transmissions, real tracking, real aiming, and simulated attack, treating the enemy as a live target.”

&gt; * PLAN leaders believe that nadi lianbing can help bolster PLAN capabilities in a number of ways. [7] First and foremost, it ensures that training is realistic. 

&gt; * But nadi lianbing is about more than just training technical skills. The PLAN believes that hostile encounters with the enemy will help strengthen the “fighting spirit” of PLAN sailors. 

&gt; * PLA commentators often highlight the existence of a “peace disease” (和平积弊, heping jibi or 和平病, heping bing) within the ranks, and they see close contact with the enemy as one way of treating this malady. 

&gt; * According to Zhang Tianjing, effective use of nadi lianbing sheds light on current U.S. operational concepts, such as distributed lethality and mosaic warfare, which he describes as “posing a fairly large challenge” to the PLAN. With this knowledge, the Chinese military can develop plans to counter likely U.S. approaches in the event of a real conflict.

&gt; * PLAN leaders fully acknowledge that nadi lianbing carries risk.

&gt; * As a result, although nadi lianbing provides a valuable learning opportunity, it also heightens the risk of an “inadvertent armed clash” (擦枪走火, ca qiang zouhuo).

&gt; * …he suggests ambiguity about using the Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES), a 2014 agreement designed to reduce risky encounters between signatory countries (including the U.S. and China). In his June 7 guidance, he stated the service must “strictly obey” CUES and other such regulations. However, the following day he called for the “flexible application” of CUES, implying that PLAN forces would abide by the Code only when it suited their needs.

Modern tests have finite detection limits and even aggressive cancers have finite growth rates. At some point, the benefit to increased screening plateaus whereas the risk with each procedure remains the same. 

For instance, the current recommendation for frequency of mammograms is 1-2 years depending on which professional society/taskforce's guidelines you follow and the patient's risk factors. That's because based on available clinical evidence, that interval is enough to catch most developing tumors in the early resectable/treatable stage without subjecting patients to unacceptable levels of radiation, discomfort, cost, etc. I'm not an OBGYN, but I would imagine that catching an invasive ductal carcinoma when it's 0.05mm vs when it's 0.1mm will likely not drastically alter prognosis, treatment options, or outcome. 

Another example is colonoscopy. The reason that for healthy adults it's set at 10 years is that available evidence shows that the time required for most polyps that are undetectable on the previous colonoscopy to actually progress through the stages of tumorigenesis to become an invasive malignancy is greater than 10 years in an adult without any history of previous high-risk polyps. Given the level of discomfort, cost, and risk to the patient from this invasive surgical procedure, doing it more frequently in the absence of risk factors is a waste of resources and just causes patients needless suffering.",6f97a68f81440672925cd875c3e2c967fab11e6f,True,False,,,,,0,1653882393,,0,{},iai8eal,False,t3_v09pc3,False,True,t1_iagfik6,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v09pc3/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_29_2022/iai8eal/,1653882411,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653853593.0,

Key Takeaways

Russian forces continued attempts to take full control of Severodonetsk.

Russian forces continued offensives southeast of Izyum but did not make any confirmed advances toward Slovyansk.

Russian forces continued offensive operations to cut Ukrainian ground lines of communication (GLOCs) northeast of Bakhmut and appear unlikely to attempt to directly assault the city.

The Ukrainian counteroffensive in northwestern Kherson Oblast has forced Russian troops to take up defensive positions and will likely disrupt Russian efforts to effectively dig in and consolidate control of occupied areas along the Southern Axis.",fe18ade6cee801ba48be4adb7eec6de53946d20a,True,False,,,,,0,1653877225,,0,{},iahybax,False,t3_v09pc3,False,True,t3_v09pc3,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v09pc3/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_29_2022/iahybax/,1653877241,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653848425.0,

*Zanj Rebellion*

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanj_Rebellion

&gt; The Zanj Rebellion (Arabic: ثورة الزنج Thawrat al-Zanj / Zinj) was a major revolt against the Abbasid Caliphate, which took place from 869 until 883. Begun near the city of Basra in present-day southern Iraq and led by one Ali ibn Muhammad, the insurrection involved enslaved Bantu-speaking people (Zanj) who had originally been captured from the coast of Southeast Africa and transported to the Middle East, principally to drain the region's salt marshes.[3] It grew to involve slaves and freemen, including both Southeastern Africans and Arabs, from several regions of the Caliphate, and claimed tens of thousands of lives before it was finally defeated.[4]",46555fb2e027f637fcd17304e8a97be32be5bc6f,True,False,,,,,0,1653871179,,0,{},iahmkzr,False,t3_uw0v3w,False,True,t3_uw0v3w,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uw0v3w/general_questions_comments_pet_theories_and/iahmkzr/,1653871193,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653842379.0,

That's down from about 40% 2 months ago. They started the war controlling most of Ukraine's coastline. 

&gt;Ukraine army and infrastructure are getting blown to pieces every day. Losses are becoming unsustainable.

Russia has fired about 2500 missiles at Ukraine in 3 months. That's honestly not as much as it sounds for a country the size of Texas with 44 million inhabitants. The quantity of missile strikes is slowing too, and will continue to slow as Russia runs low on missiles. Ukrainian losses are immense, but not catastrophic and surely not unsustainable. 

&gt;Ukraine economy doesnt exist anymore, it is completely reliant on external charity and loans.

That's not true at all. Their economy is in trouble, because of course it is, but its not 100% reliant on foreign aid at all. Lucky for Ukraine they're getting quite a bit of foreign aid anyway. 

&gt;Population decrease soon to approach 25% as almost 10 million people left the country.

Really, there's no way for them to retake lost territory? Have you been asleep the past 3 months? Ukraine has reclaimed huge swaths of land already, most recently they retook almost the entirety of Kharkiv oblast.
