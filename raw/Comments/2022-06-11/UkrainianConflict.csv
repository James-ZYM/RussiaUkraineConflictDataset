I mean you could get creative with the turrets or hulls I guess. Not on the frontline though, more like on the border next to belarus for example to lighten the impact any attack from there would have. I'm not saying its a great idea but I've read that there have been a ton of ukrainians that wanted to fight but they werent combat ready, too old or just not capable maybe reusing old western equipment for stuff like this would make these people useful and you might get something that adds protection at back lines.

First, NATO will announce at the end of June that more is needed in Ukraine. They will announce air support. Then I would expect Ukraine tells its front lines to fall back. The Americans will then perform a shock and aww campaign on Russian front lines, logistics, and key locations in Ukraine and near border Russia. Europe will be focused on containment via strategic strikes. Once the Americans destroy Russias ability to fight then the Ukrainians will send troops to these areas to secure them. I don’t think they will see much resistance when they renter these areas.

I should mention this is just my guess. It’s based on the current mood in America and the increasing rhetoric between China and the USA. A Russian defeat can serve as a lesson to China not to invade Taiwan. The president has said he will not make the same mistake with Taiwan. This could mean that he regrets not getting involved sooner in Ukraine. IMO, it’s becoming clear that America and Allies have to send a message to the world that it is unacceptable to invade a sovereign country. A peace deal where Ukraine gives up land is a bad look for the situation in Taiwan. China would love to negotiate Taiwans independence away. It’s not a good message to send.

It's very hard to find something anyone who supports Ukraine can disagree with in said video. 

Trump comes to power in a nation drowning in debt. He looks out at NATO and sees an alliance where the USA foots virtually all the bill, and whose member states all chronically under fund their responsibilities counting on the USA to bail them out should things ever go south and correctly he sees a major issue. While it seems like some countries such as Poland probably are deserving of NATO others with Germany being the biggest example clearly don't. Let's face it NATO is there to keep countries from being invaded by Russia. If these countries then make their country fully dependent on Russia for their energy it's inexcusable! 

If you disagree with me, ask what's NATO'S biggest role in the current conflict? As far as I can tell it's this great shield that allows Germany and other countries to fearlessly send one of the world's worst dictators since Hitler billions of dollars a day in exchange for blood energy, all the while knowing the murder, rape and destruction that they are financing will be contained within the borders of Ukraine and never threaten them.

You had enough driving and flying machines to share at least something. Instead, you blocked even what you had and delayed the rest as much as possible. 

If a tank doesn't drive, it can be fixed pretty fast. We know that - we did that a lot recently.

First of all after the fall of the iron crutain and for the reunification of Germany in 1990 there were agreements to reduce the landforce of unified Germany, no nuclear, chemical or biological weapons no NATO troops stationed in Eastern Germany...

Peter Struck under Schröder in 2004? (SPD/Greens Coalition) started a long planed reform of the Bundeswehr this included the closer of 105 Army Bases the further reduction of 75.000 civil and military personal. The reduction of basically all military vehicles for example from 2100+ Leopard 2 Tanks down to 350 or something like that....

This reform was also planned because Partners like the US asked for more international cooperation in Anti Terror, Anti Pirate Missions.... a slow transformation from an armed to the teeth defence force to a highly specialized and more mobile internationally operating Force.

When Merkel in 2005 took over (CDU/SPD Coalition) she continued this plan because at the time that was what Partners asked for and there was no perceived threat of a major landwar in Europe. What happened next was the conscription in 2011 was paused because with the previous reduction of the landforces it was seen as unjust for those who were called in while more and more got away without the need to serve. 

Now we can argue about the NATO 2% defense spending goal this was first agreed on in 2002 while Schröder was Chancellor and Peter Struck defence secretary. In reality not many NATO Members met that goal so in 2014 when Merkel was Chancellor it was again while not legally binding agreed to increase thedefense spending in the next 10 years to the 2% goal. So in 2024 this goal should be met. So while legally not binding there still would be 2 years to meet that goal and as it looks like we now will hit that goal even before 2024.

They've been harassed since, they've being called with threats to lives of their kids every month. The whole intellectual class left the country. Just like old KGB and NKVD days. So if you aren't apolitical, you will go to jail.

So what you suggest? Give Belarusian people armory just like you give it to Ukraine and maybe hundreds of thousands people will be able to get through Lukashenko army. But then it's Putin army which is much stronger and has everything to destroy Belarusian cities like Mariupol.

Better ask European governments, people like Merkel, Scholz, Kneissl, Schreder, what they did to help people of Belarus - or they have contributed to increasing power of cruel Belarusian regime. Germans, Austrians and Italians were always happy to make business not just with Putin, but with Lukashenko too, despite knowing what kind of devil he is. So don't speak about people getting what they've deserved, or it's like young people being born in 21 century are responsible for their grandparents who were idiotic enough to elect a tyran back in 90s.

And the funniest thing is that Trump is so, so similar to Lukashenko, a man who would do anything and kill everyone to increase his own power, and Americans still elect such a tyran. The only difference is that the US had 300 years of democracy, so Trumpism is limited by the democratic institutions, and the whole history of free Belarus was like 4 years before the dictator came into power, and when he was impeached back in 90s, Moscow emissars helped him and destroyed the opposition",a340c2a651233897cfd0787309ff9f28ea56879d,True,False,,,,,0,1654985609,,0,{},ic0sog5,False,t3_v9w4ig,False,True,t1_ibzy7i4,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v9w4ig/lukashenko_admits_that_belarus_will_fight_for/ic0sog5/,1654985622,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654956809.0,

Not sure what is ""damals"", but ok, what if I am wrong?

Let's separate what we know for sure and what I suppose.

We know for sure that Germany blocked our NATO membership, appeased Russia, betrayed us during Minsk negotiations and pushed us to capitulate. Also we know for sure that Germany haven't sent any heavy weapons so far and announced too few and too late. 

What I suppose is that Germany sabotages deliveries of heavy weapons, because it definitely has enough working weapons to share and it can safely wait until a replacement is fixed or produced. Our nation faces genocide and German policy toward Russia is one of the main reasons for it. In such a situation, only evil will can be the answer. For some reason, Germany doesn't want to help and doesn't want to fix its past evil.

What can prove me wrong? Sudden delivery of a significant amount of heavy weapons. 

But let me ask you - what if I am right? What if your country actually helps Russia? What if you are helping them to win this war and finish this genocide? Because whatever the reason is, Germany doesn't do nearly enough to prevent it.",c230328f4f7614756496d6c653928b3b499a1990,True,False,,,,,0,1654985409,,0,{},ic0sakc,False,t3_va41p6,False,True,t1_ic0puja,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/va41p6/great_news_for_ukraine_scholz_macron_and_draghi/ic0sakc/,1654985423,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654956609.0,

Because that would be a bad PR for Germany to officially recognise, but they planned to eventually do it. Had Russia been successful at their ""few days special operation"" and taken over Kyiv, Germany would have been offered heavy discount on energy in exchange of recognising new puppet government as legitimate. The whole ""Ukrainian are Nazis"" concept, was so that Germany would confirm it is true as an ""authority"" on Nazism. The operation of course failed, German head of security (who was supposed to make appropriate contacts with new government) had to be evacuated from Ukraine. Scholz still had hopes that Russia prevail and so he was blocking and sabotaging help to Ukraine as much as he could, while trying to play dumb and using all possible German stereotypes (like violence is not an answer, we don't have weapons, let's find peaceful solution, let's not escalate) etc. etc.

I believe his actions were curbed by the US and he realised he is probably not going to win. Now he only hopes that Putin will not release kompromats they have on him.

&gt; If Russia was about to collapse, they would start peace negotiations where they would try to have some of the land they have taken.

This is wrong for several reasons. First, a collapse in war isn't *that* sudden. Supply lines get cut, units are left to fend for themselves, intentionally to ravage enemy territory they occupy for supplies. So if even Russia's ability to supply its units in the field came to a (implausible) complete halt, its combat power would not, and it's occupation in Ukraine would not. 

Second, Russia knows that its proposals in peace negotiations are not credible to Ukraine, especially as you phrase it (""try to have some of the land they have taken""). They know Ukraine isn't going to take that deal. The only plausible sort of agreement Ukraine would make with Russia would be localized ceasefires for humanitarian reasons (and they have been endlessly burned by Russia violating those already). And the ""real"" peace negotiations where Russia meets Ukraine's demands and pledges to withdraw from Ukraine's internationally recognized borders? They're never going to happen - the Russians would eat their leaders for that indignity. 

Russia does not have the realistic prospect of admitting it's backing down. It has to be beaten. 

Because of that, Russia has every incentive to bluff and terrorize Ukraine in hopes of forcing their surrender. There is no half-measure available to Russia. I know I said military collapse isn't all *that* sudden, but Russia is liable to set a new record in that regard because of these circumstances.",e0edd6ae57278b782790de12ead43b68f83a7fdc,True,False,,,,,0,1654984567,,0,{},ic0qo7q,False,t3_va2onu,False,True,t1_ic0hz0k,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/va2onu/putin_has_made_his_beliefs_and_goals_clear_total/ic0qo7q/,1654984580,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654955767.0,

580,[],False,,Exidoous,,,[],,,,text,t2_zsbn5,False,False,"&gt; It should be noted, iirc oil is 3 times the income of Russia compared to gas. Gas is needed for economy in Europe, mainly Germany (who made themselves too dependent) and no one else can supply enough, not even Ukraine. Oil however, might be able to be gotten from elsewhere like the Middle East and US if really needed, so I see that as an easier to attain goal.

You're right that oil is a much larger amount of revenue for Russia than gas, pre-invasion. But otherwise you're looking at this from an exclusively Western perspective. The important thing to do is make sure the sanctions hurt Russia, not how relatively costless they are for us. Russia's oil is predominately shipped by tanker, and any amoral third world country is a potential customer, even if Europe halted all oil purchases from Russia, as the U.S. has. Russia would still sell most if not all of their current production. The price (necessary discount) does go down between the status quo versus a complete European embargo, but that's just a mitigation of Russian revenues.

Russia's gas on the other hand, is I think exclusively shipped by pipeline, and Russia doesn't have the pipeline (capacity) to send most of its production currently supplying Europe anywhere else. If Europe nutted up and shut its pipelines, Russia would simply cease production on those gas sources - money right off the top of their budget, no mitigation. That's why it's so consequential that they do that... months ago.

&gt; To me it seems that Europe tried to integrate Russia into their economy to bring them into the EU economic fold like the Baltics and Poland, but it backfired heavily against a non-rational leader.

This is a bad take coming to close to the right conclusion. 

Ostpolitik was wrong - integrating Russia into Europe's economy did not deter Russia from risking those links in taking its current actions. Ostpolitik was *catastrophic* in that those links are not even threatened from the European side in the short term: Europe keeps buying oil until the end of the year, and then ""stops"" (with huge loopholes). Europe keeps buying gas until maybe, two years from now, loopholes tbd. Continued *billions* a day all but gifted to Russia to fund its genocidal war. Ostpolitik wasn't just a proven-bad bet vis a vis Russia's behavior, it, combined with the present-fecklessness of Europe's leadership, has all but guaranteed Russia's funding in these critical early months. The U.S. under a Democratic administration is very unlikely to slap around its European ""allies"" for funding Russia. But if Russia's oil production - in the absence of ostpolitik - was serving the third world? It would be a very different picture.

Finally, and this is very, very important. There is no reason to conclude that Putin, that his Russian regime, is irrational. Is Putin *maybe* crazy? Sure, he's old and sick. But every single action taken can be explained rationally - and it is a very bad analytical step to assume your subject is irrational. 

Putin may be the richest man alive. He's old, and spent his entire life buried in stupid, revanchist, Russian thinking. Why not spend the resources Russian leaders have always been happy to expend: money, men, women, children, for a shot at conquering Ukraine, and rebuilding the empire? Because it'll upset whatever feckless moron is running Germany right now? That's barely even within Russia's calculus.

Russia absolutely made mistakes: they underestimated Ukrainian resolve, and overestimated their own military readiness. But both of those can be explained by bad intelligence, especially the dictator trap (where he only gets good, inaccurate news from his terrified minions). But mistakes are not irrationality.",be3ffadfeaa8cf24a900951a0c6065020cc675a6,True,False,,,,,0,1654983676,,0,{},ic0oxlb,False,t3_v9ma34,False,True,t1_ic0lkr5,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v9ma34/russiaukraine_latest_moscow_able_to_fight_war_for/ic0oxlb/,1654983692,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654954876.0,

And you’re also denying any German appeasement when Merkel denied that Russia was weaponising gas even though they were deliberately creating scarcity  by keeping the gas reserves extremely low. All so that she didn’t have to cancel nord stream 2.

Lmao, I said that because I seen it in the past. I am not going to watch it again just to find whatever you want me to find, since you don't even mention what exactly you want me to find there.  
  
&gt; it’s full of “completely inaccurate information”  
  
I know it is inaccurate, due to the fact, that I am, in fact, Ukrainian, living in Ukraine, and most of the stuff he is saying demonstrated he does not understand our country at all. He speaks about us, as people, as some sort of non alive entity to be used by either Russia or the West, completely ignoring the most important part - what do we, the people living here, think about all of this.  
  
He also completely misunderstands the reasons why Russia wants Ukraine and buys into the whole BS argument about them not wanting NATO on their borders. This is complete BS - Russia wants Ukraine, period. NATO, non NATO - that stuff does not change the fact that Russia wants Ukraine for itself. Talks about NATO are just blame shifting from real motivation behind it.     
  
&gt; Then you make a straw man argument. I didn’t say NATO “on their borders” I clearly said “Ukraine”. And your point about “NATO not necessarily meaning blah blah blah”, is just silly. It’s a military alliance.

Defensive alliance. Russia is nuclear power with nukes in the middle of Europe. They already have security assurance - their nukes. NATO countries would never invade Russia and there is nothing to suggest they would.  
  
&gt; As for propaganda digestion, you are a textbook example. Your cognitive dissonance causes you to just spasm and yell “Russian propaganda” instead of actually doing research other reviewing CNN’s talking points.

I think the one who is victim of media is you, because you are instantly placing me into the box of ""CNN talking points"" or whatever, and it does not even cross your mind that lot of people on this subreddit are people who actually, physically present in Ukraine or around, and involved in this whole thing personally, instead of judging about it from sides.",4e4dcc6b74e2654081d252baa4d5b9821dd319ca,True,False,,,,,0,1654978376,,0,{},ic0ecl1,False,t3_va4eat,False,True,t1_ic0cwt8,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/va4eat/there_is_no_way_the_ukrainians_will_ever_defeat/ic0ecl1/,1654978394,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654949576.0,

1. Not all Russian nukes lack readiness, and if nato attacks Russia or Russia attacks nato the nukes will be ready before that decision is acted upon. The idea that NATO will mass nuke Russia just for bringing their nukes to basic readiness is mind boggling stupid. They will not. Claiming that is their policy is straight up incorrect. The only policy for first strike on Russia involves a response to starting the final firing preparations, which are not very long at all, and would not fully prevent a retaliatory strike. 

2. ICBMs are not the nukes they would use in a fight in their backyard where they already have nuke capable launch platforms available. In a war between nato and Russia where Russia is losing they would not use ICBMs, cause that's stupid. Thats like taking a jet to go to the supermarket. They would be using small tactical nukes on the front lines, which would not trigger the MAD policies of any other country. It feels like you don't even know there are nukes other than ICBMs and you are basing all of your claims on movies.

&gt; No it was UK/US.

You have no  idea what you're talking about as usual. Also your nation armed Putin so I don't know if you should talk.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/01/what-budapest-memorandum-means-us-ukraine/

&gt;But unlike Article 5 of the NATO charter, it does not require a specific response from the United States or others. So it’s worth a little history lesson.

&gt;The reality is much murkier. The agreement is not an official treaty. It is neither legally binding nor does it carry an enforcement mechanism. And while it provides security assurances, they do not include specific promises with regard to a potential invasion.",70886fbb7f022239de9205241d56d8425e63d7d0,True,False,,,,,0,1654974120,,0,{},ic05gew,False,t3_v8fmux,False,True,t1_ibttabo,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v8fmux/duda_poland_has_sent_more_than_240_tanks_about/ic05gew/,1654974149,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654945320.0,
1352,[],False,,fat-lobyte,,,[],,,,text,t2_t1mqn,False,False,"&gt; ""They can barely hold Severodonetzk"" implies that they are trying. But they are not. It's not about holding it, it's about causing as many casualties as they can. The city doesn't hold any real strategical value, on the contrary, it's said to be hard to hold. They will stay as long as they can cause enough Russian casualties, but if the own casualties become too high they will simply fall back to Lysychansk, which is actually very easy to hold.

That is what I thought too, but it's not consistent with what we're seeing. Just recently, Zelensky said that they're losing up to 200 soldiers a day. If they are about causing casualties, it's not good to suffer such heavy casualties themselves. Why haven't they already retreated to Lysychansk?

Additionally there have been statements like this: [In many respects, the fate of the Donbas is being decided there](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61740692), as well as saying that they want to keep it because it will be very hard to get it back later.

&gt; Besides, even if they tried to hold it your statement seems to be wrong, because all the latest news seem to be implying that they are holding 60-80% more or less (it does go back and forth apparently), and that's now several days into the focused Russian offensive. To me that's quite decent ""holding"".

Yes, there are claims from both sides about gains and losses, but I don't take them very seriously because it's almost impossible to verify. What's also impossible to verify is how many troops the Russians are losing and whether it's a number that makes the Ukrainian losses worth it. Would be nice, but I haven't seen any numbers from serious sources.

However, quoting https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/10/were-almost-out-of-ammunition-and-relying-on-western-arms-says-ukraine

&gt; “This is an artillery war now,” said Vadym Skibitsky, deputy head of Ukraine’s military intelligence. The frontlines were now where the future would be decided, he told the Guardian, “and we are losing in terms of artillery”.

I mean I know the point is that he wants weapons from the west, but if you logically combine the two sentences ""we are losing in terms of artillery"" and ""This is an artillery war"" you can see that those Ukrainians who actually know something are significantly less optimistic than people here. I think it would be a hilarious experiment to post this out of context and then watch the downvotes pour in.

&gt; So if Lukashenko even managed to finally get his army to attack, there is a real chance that parts of it will simply desert or - even worse - revolt, other parts will fight but with very poor morale, and only a rather small, loyal part will try to fight properly

Yes, I am aware of the ""mood"" in Belarus. So is Lukashenko, which is why he still has not attacked and why he will not attack. We will see how the war turns out, but for now he's ""relatively"" stable.

&gt; The Russians failed to even approach Kiyev properly, let alone assault it. It's the capital of the country, close to the border of Belarus, and they would have to take or at least somewhat surround it and block it off so they can invade the rest of the country from the north. So if the Russians failed at that task, why would some Belarussians succeed?

Ok, hold on. We're talking about completely different things here. You are talking about Belarus entering Ukraine in order to capture Kiev or something. I fully agree that this is ludicrous and could never work. But that's not what I said at all. I was replying to a comment that (jokingly?) claimed that Ukraine would ""conquer"" Belarus, implying the exact opposite, namely that UAF would have to enter Belarus. Do you think that is a realistic option? Because my downvotes clearly prove that most people here do think it's perfectly reasonable for Ukraine to just waltz into Belarus.",9ca587bced82e37cc96fa226a823a619b35e0aba,True,False,,,,,0,1654974110,,0,{},ic05fqq,False,t3_v9w4ig,False,True,t1_ibzpc41,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v9w4ig/lukashenko_admits_that_belarus_will_fight_for/ic05fqq/,1654974150,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654945310.0,

Afghanistan Desaster that was stupid

Drone warfare or how to commit war crimes ""cleanly"" (US policy of killing 100 civilians for 1 terrorist as ""acceptable"")

Iraq war or ""how to lie to your allies and the world and starting a war of agression against another country"" and destroy any credibility NATO militaries had with the public

NATO bombing Lybia to shits and leaving it a hell hole

The USA covering up war crimes and hunting people uncovering them over the entire planet on fasle charges, full on Putin style

At least here in Germany the US military actions have ruined the name of the military to such a degree that every talk of increasing military spending was ususally dead from the start and lacked any major support before 2014

If the usual thing people read about NATO is the USA drone striking a wedding in afghanistan, lying about WMDs in Iraq, bombing Lybia to dust, a compleatly pointless war in afghanistan, etc. nobody wills upport the military.

And truth is, most european countries can only do one thing: Eather continental defense or expeditionary army. The USA dragging NATO to afghanistan resulted in most european armys switching to a expeditionary military (smaller, high quality force, equipped for anti terrorism warfare) that has very different requiremeants then fighting a WW3 scenario.

Since 2014 most european countries have returned to a continental defense focus but you dont switch a policy of 14 years around over night and just creat the necessary weapons out of thin air. Germany is the perfect example that just throwing money at the problem doesnt give you a good of functioning military. Germany in total spends more on its military then France despite France having the NATO 2% goal achieved while at the same time having a pathetic navy, a non funtioning army and a joke of an airforce compared to France. 

Just throwing money at a problem without the necessary infrastructure doesnt work and militaries need to be build up slowly. Even if germany decided in 2014 to go to 2% (which wouldnt have had any support from the public and would be political suicide) I very much doubt that the german army would be much better off then it is today. Msot of that moeny would have propably went into capabilities to fight in afghanistanlike transport planes, own logistics, etc and not in the continental defense. Germany commited one of the biggest forces to Afghanistan while msot of eastern europe didnt do shit so its obvious why msot western european countries are not prepared for a continental war when the doctrien, spearheaded by the USA, for the alst 20 years was anti terror warfare in the middle of nowhere.

&gt;“Merkel’s appeasement” 

Also, waht the fuck is is this supposed to mean? Nobody appeased Russia. Germany didnt even increase its imports in natural ressources from Russia since 2014 and accusing it of trading with Russia is just retarded. They have been doing it since the 1970s on the exact same scale...during the cold war with the soviet union...and if most other natural ressource providers are eather horrible regimes like Quatar and Saudi Arabia or getting invaded or embargoed by the USA (Iraq, Iran, Lybia, Venezuela) then the alternatives to Russia become significantly small and Russia appears to be a good partner. And lets not forget that every time EU coutnries worked on opening new supply routes for natural ressources the USA destroyed thouse attempts. The Iran Nuclear Deal, years of work, destroyed by Trump is the perfect example. It would have given the EU access to the massive ammount of cheap, non OPEC controlled Oil supply from Iran that would have immediatly reduced Russias Oil exports significantly. But the US oil industry didnt like that so it destroyed it  with their Trump puppet, trying to force EU countries to buy more US oil (""america first"") which instead lead to more oil from russia beeing bought. 

And on the issue of gas I shouldnt have to point out the obvious but apart from russia there is literally no supplier capable of fullfilling europes gas demand. The russian share of around 40% is bigger then the entire global LNG market currently, just saying.

The basic strategy of economic interconnectivity with countries to try to bring them into the western block and change them for the better the EU tried with Russia seems stupid today, until you realize that it literally is the reason for why nearly all the eastern block countries formerly in the warsaw pact are now part of the EU and/or NATO and have massively improved economcially and socially since the 1990s.

Has literally nothing to do with it but ok

The USA is one military force, Europe supplies over 20 individual armies. They have individual arms projects, individual basic infrastructure, etc.

The US military can spend 100 billion far more efficently then europe if you consider it as one block. This leads to one simple result: Most military equippmeant in european armies is inside the active duty militaries and basically none is in storage. Each country has to build its own infrastructures to support most weapon systems in their military and even with increased cooperation between them this basic problem remains.

I mean the US operates one type of tank. European NATO members alone operate 3 and more different MBTs in their militaries that need different infrastructure, supply lines, arms companys and so on.

The US has a few rifles and standartised equippmeant for infantery. Europe has as many different rifles and different equippmeants as there are armies.

In short, even if all EU NATO members would spend 2% on their military (which they only have to do until 2024 btw) it would still be far less effective and result in far weaker forces then the US military and more importantly for ukraine a far smaller ability to supply them with spare weapons.

&gt;Only the Eastern European countries that can’t sit their and Niavly believe war will never come to them have been doing their part in spending. Western Europe outside of the UK has been spitting in the faces of their NATO allies.

How to say you are american without saying it directly. Mabye dont drag everybody into your bullshit wars int he desert and people wouldnt think of the military as just warcrime enhancers or US lackeys in most of western europe. And by the way France very much spends 2% of its budget and very much is in western europe. And the 2% goal is compelatly artificial and ahs nothing to do with the military capabilities of a country. Germany spends until the war with ukraine around 1.5% of its GDP for its military but still, in total numbers, spend the same ammount of money as France and more then any eastern european country. Problem is jsut throwing money at a problem doesnt get you a good military.

And if the USA would stop invading other countries under falsified evidence and stop protecting war criminals like George W. Bush you can go accuse european countrys of not doing their part because nobody wants to take part in US imperialism as much as nobody wants to take part in russian imperialism. And im not even going to talk about how the USA ""rewards"" countries that fullfill their NATO obligations and want to increase european military spending like France with fucking them over and backstabbing them.

And the fact the USA is such a reliable ally that every election you have to pray it doesnt become an backstabbing idiot like Trump (destroyed Iran deal, threatend to dissolve NATO overnight) or a war criminal like Bush (Iraq) again tells you enough why nobody listens to the USA anymore. Beeing allied with the USA is like playing russian roulette the last 20 years",74d959f11252bf2c37ef53776299e291f37cb7d1,True,False,,,,,0,1654970933,,0,{},ibzyq79,False,t3_va11xk,False,True,t1_ibzra1w,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/va11xk/a_maximum_of_ten_instead_of_40_tanks_and_an/ibzyq79/,1654970952,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654942133.0,

Him sending in his military to and heavy losses would be the most destabilising and stupid action that would herald the end of his regime I think.

Unless the vassalisation of Belarus has continued to consolidate the armed forces more tightly.

Belarus is already part of the union state and being swarmed with Russian agents and officials and I think putin is likely working on the army and replacing commanders.

I think it could be that putin has placed enough Russian security services in the Belarus armed forces and feels he really needs the troops. He probably doesn’t care about the effect on Belarus and feels whatever if there’s unrest I’ll just use the remaining garrison in Belarus to crack down and crack two birds with one stone and tighten control further.

He doesn’t care if it means lukashenko will be toppled.

If he feels the troops will secure Ukraine it even strikes three birds.

He wins in Ukraine using the troops.

He gets to topple lukashenko and further vassalised Belarus bringing both countries into the union state.

He also in Typical putin fashion gets to avoid blame as he can blame lukashenko for the losses of Belarusians then put in a more fully controlled puppet.

The TL;DW of it is rusnia oil is doomed because:

- Most oil pipelines go west from Siberia, since most of it goes to Europe anyway.
- The EU sanctioning insurance on oil shipments makes shipping almost impossible.
- Captains are refusing to dock in rusia to get oil, and dock workers in Europe are refusing to unload russian cargo (and sometimes telling the rusnia ships to go nakhuy when they ask to refuel).
- The port in novorossyisk is a shallow port, so they can't get supertankers there to load them; they have to use smaller tankers, then sail those to the Mediterranean, and do a sea-to-sea transfer. (Also, as the Black Sea is a war zone, getting insurance there is impossible even without sanctions).
- The EU and NATO might block the Danish strait and the Bosphorus to all rusnia oil.
- The pipes that connect rusia to China are not connected to the ones going West, so they can't just re-route oil to that pipe.
- The oil going out of eastern siberia to China requires western companies with the appropriate tools and expertise to run the projects, since a lot of them are in permafrost and difficult conditions that rusnia can't exploit by itself.

Yes, many Swedes went as foreign fighters to participate in the winter war, along with smaller numbers of fighters from other countries. But the numbers pale in comparison to the legions that have flocked to Ukraine.

This attributes so much more power and influence to Germany that it ever had in the last 80 years. Germany still doesn't even have the biggest army in Germany, but whatever lol.

We could argue much about what has been sent by Germany and France, and that is the funny point, it marginalises what the US does or does not.

I would expect the US to send 10x more.

Besides, even if they tried to hold it your statement seems to be wrong, because all the latest news seem to be implying that they are holding 60-80% more or less, and that's now several days into the focused Russian offensive. To me that's quite decent ""holding"".

Next thing is that you don't seem to be aware of what the general mood is in Belarus. They are fed up with Lukashenko, and he's at the constant brim of ending up at the sticky end of a revolution. The only thing keeping him in power is basically Putin protecting him by potentially offering military support in an uprising.

Since the beginning of the war there have been repeated reports at different points of time (weeks and months apart) which said that Belarus soldiers have been told to invade Ukraine but refused. They have no ill intention towards their neighbours, and they don't feel like war at all. What they DO feel like is getting rid of Lukashenko though. 

So if Lukashenko even managed to finally get his army to attack, there is a real chance that parts of it will simply desert or - even worse - revolt, other parts will fight but with very poor morale, and only a rather small, loyal part will try to fight properly. Given the fact that the Belarus army won't be a lot better trained or equipped than the Russian one, they will receive a heavy beating from the Ukrainians, and what does Lukashenko then have? The loyal part of his army is gone, the rest is probably already fighting him together with the Ukrainians, and the general populace hates him.

The Russians failed to even approach Kiyev properly, let alone assault it. It's the capital of the country, close to the border of Belarus, and they would have to take or at least somewhat surround it and block it off so they can invade the rest of the country from the north. So if the Russians failed at that task, why would some Belarussians succeed?

The buildup was exactly a scaled up version of the annexation of Crimea. The consequences of annexation were so relaxed, that Russia had enough confidence in their ability to begin expanding the empire. 

Russia has been attempting to resurge as a superpower since it got out of debt. But the West has been reluctant to actually take it seriously. The whole concept of avoiding war through diplomacy only works when the aggressor knows they're weaker than their counterpart. Not when they're high on their own propaganda, that even NATO allies start to believe the hype.

Yet, NATO over emphasizing the capabilities of the Russian military. While also not taking their alliance commitments seriously, only seeded complacency.

The inaction of Europe not to increase help to Ukraine will only undermine their own stability in the near and distant future.  As long as Russia remains this dysfunctional, Europe will never find peace.

2039,[],False,,seniorjax,,,[],,,,text,t2_v48hqn,False,False,"&gt;\#The Spanish government is considering sending 40 Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, according to a media report.  
  
\#According to information from Business Insider, however, the number has now been revised significantly downwards. It is therefore about a maximum of ten tanks, which are also still dilapidated, it is said from German government circles.  
  
\#Whether it ever comes to such a delivery, is therefore completely open. Above all, it would have increased the pressure on Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) to follow suit with German tanks.  
  
The news caused a great stir in Berlin on the Whitsun weekend: According to a report in the daily newspaper ""El Pais"", the Spanish government is to think about sending up to 40 old Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine, which it had bought from German industry in the 90s. Especially politically, this would be extremely sensitive, especially for Germany: it would be the first time that a NATO member would send modern tanks to Ukraine. The pressure on Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) to finally follow suit would increase extremely.  
  
But according to information from Business Insider from German government circles, the alleged offer from Madrid has apparently shrunk significantly. Meanwhile, it is only about a maximum of ten tanks, according to people who are familiar with the process. And even this number is uncertain, as the vehicles are apparently completely dilapidated and will only have to be repaired in the next few months. And in any case, the delivery in Spain would first have to be coordinated within the government. Spanish officials are said to have admitted this, who are said to have apologized to the federal government for the excitement – and the resulting pressure on the chancellor.  
  
No wonder, then, that there has not yet been an application to the German government to deliver Spanish tanks to Ukraine. According to so-called end-use clauses in armaments contracts, the German government must agree to resales of German armaments to third countries. These regulations are intended to prevent German weapons of war from being used by dictatorships or child soldiers in civil wars, for example.

Just to remind you that until now Germany haven't sent not even one piece of heavy weapons in Ukraine. Until now just loads of empty promises and maybe in 22nd of June (4 months since war stared) just 7x PZh 2000 in for a war of heavy artillery with \~1500 Km front line.",af8c6e65b06a2e206348cdedbf684e049e6510b2,True,False,,,,,0,1654964813,,0,{},ibzlkcy,True,t3_va11xk,False,True,t3_va11xk,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/va11xk/a_maximum_of_ten_instead_of_40_tanks_and_an/ibzlkcy/,1654964830,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654936013.0,

And yet this verdict of hindsight needs an asterisk. What appears obvious today was far from clear at the time. Hitler might, conceivably, have stopped in Czechoslovakia, without going on to Poland, and then the rest of Europe and Auschwitz. Putin, plausibly, could have sought to rebuild Russia’s reputation and economy rather than turning his country into an international pariah. He might have died or been ousted. Even Merkel couldn’t have foreseen how isolated, physically and mentally, he would become.   

Diplomacy isn’t wrong just because it sometimes fails, Merkel reflected on stage. Overall, she said, she has no regrets, because she couldn’t have tried harder to prevent the tragedy that is now unfolding.

Exactly one year ago, I profiled the then-outgoing chancellor of 16 years, calling her legacy “post-heroic.” That adjective looks even more apt today. And yet, at the time the balance of her achievements was positive. She had been a leader of small steps, but above all a reassuring chancellor who, through successive crises, held together Germany, Europe and sometimes the West. Her meekness and accommodation toward Russia — and China — were no more than footnotes in a multi-chapter tome on leadership.

Putin inverted that narrative, and thus Merkel’s legacy. The footnotes are now the title. Whatever her reasons at the time, Merkel, like Chamberlain, now stands for appeasement. Her most unforgivable failure was that — if she already understood the threat from Putin as she claims — she did not explain the danger to Germans and Europeans. By not communicating, she left the continent unprepared.",001b4635c01dea98128600dec31c985b2ff46978,True,False,,,,,0,1654963860,,0,{},ibzjhqu,True,t3_va0r5c,False,True,t1_ibzjh8l,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/va0r5c/merkel_will_enter_history_as_the_neville/ibzjhqu/,1654963876,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654935060.0,

And Germany’s army? The country began cutting its defense spending before her time, but much of the demilitarization that its allies have long criticized happened on her watch. And yet, she countered, her party was the only one that wrote the NATO goal of spending 2% of gross domestic product on defense into its platform. Besides, she did increase military spending in recent years. More wasn’t possible with her coalition partners and the public mood at the time.

Again and again, Merkel returned to the Minsk agreements of 2014 and 2015. Those were the talks in which she and the president of France, hosted by the leader of Belarus, moderated between Putin and Ukraine’s leader at the time. The result wasn’t pretty. Ukraine had to make big concessions over its eastern parts, the so-called Donbas, in return for a ceasefire that would never really be observed. 

And yet, Merkel insisted, these Minsk agreements bought Ukraine valuable time — time it was able to use to prepare for the real Russian onslaught this year. Her heart always beat for Ukraine, she said, but she had a duty to work with the reality on the ground. And Minsk restored calm, at least briefly.

Thoughtful and articulate as she was on this theater stage, she made me think of Neville Chamberlain, and more so the longer she spoke. He was the British prime minister who in 1938 met with Adolf Hitler in Munich, to secure what he hoped would be “peace in our time.” 

At that time, the Nazi leader had already remilitarized the Rhineland and annexed Austria, and was preparing to swallow Czechoslovakia, claiming that its ethnic Sudeten Germans were threatened by “annihilation.” The echoes should have been audible already in Minsk, after Putin had assaulted Georgia, Crimea and Donbas.  

Merkel, like Chamberlain, may therefore go down in history as the embodiment of the democratic world’s “appeasement” of a tyrant who — with hindsight — could never have been appeased. Intelligent and sophisticated politicians both, Merkel and Chamberlain will be remembered as going wobbly when they should have drawn a line, as being weak when they should have been strong. In history lessons, Merkel in Minsk will be paired with Chamberlain in Munich.",906f758c2de09c59e0ef6bfd88f84701e1745406,True,False,,,,,0,1654963853,,0,{},ibzjh8l,True,t3_va0r5c,False,True,t1_ibzjgpw,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/va0r5c/merkel_will_enter_history_as_the_neville/ibzjh8l/,1654963868,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654935053.0,

**The former German chancellor, like the 1930s' British prime minister, will be remembered for appeasing an aggressive tyrant.**

There she was again, six months after exiting the German chancellery. Relaxed but pensive after long walks on blustering Baltic shores listening to Macbeth on audiobook, Angela Merkel had so much on her mind, so much she wanted to explain for posterity. But she didn’t come to offer apologies or mea culpas. 

Reflecting on decades of interactions with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Merkel said she’d always known that commerce and dialogue alone wouldn’t turn him into a good neighbor. But what was Germany supposed to do: Ignore the largest country on its continent? 

She grasped early on, she recalled, that Putin “hated” democracy and wanted to “destroy” the European Union, which he viewed as a gateway drug to NATO membership for former Soviet Republics like Ukraine, which he considers part of Russia’s — and therefore, his own — sphere of influence. 

Merkel conceded that the NATO compromise of 2008 was far from ideal. She had blocked the alliance from starting the long process of making Ukraine and Georgia members, convinced that such a step would have provoked exactly the type of war that Putin is waging now. Besides, she recalled, Ukraine was not yet the country of heroes it has become, but a corrupt place run by oligarchs that many NATO allies wouldn’t have been ready to defend. 

The compromise, as she helped hash it out, was to declare that Ukraine and Georgia could join NATO someday, just not now. That left Ukraine disappointed, and Putin livid nonetheless. 

Merkel denied that her response was too soft when Putin annexed Crimea in 2014. After all, Russia was kicked out of the Group of Eight, making it the G7 again. And she helped keep the EU united in first passing, and then renewing, sanctions against Russia. It would have been worse, she said, if some countries had forged ahead with tougher measures, but ended up splitting Europe and the West, which is what Putin wanted and still wants.",16f302e6e00526b7adfc1da7eb2a351349810134,True,False,,,,,0,1654963846,,0,{},ibzjgpw,True,t3_va0r5c,False,True,t3_va0r5c,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/va0r5c/merkel_will_enter_history_as_the_neville/ibzjgpw/,1654963861,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654935046.0,

&gt; KYIV, Ukraine, June 10 - Ukrainian officials pleaded for more help from the West on Friday, including quicker deliveries of artillery and battlefield rocket systems, to hold off Russian forces at a critical time in the battle in the east.

&gt; Chronic hunger could afflict up to 19 million more people globally over the next year due to reduced exports of wheat and other food commodities from Ukraine and Russia, the United Nations&amp;#039; food agency said.

&gt; The Ukrainian mayor of Mariupol, now operating outside the southern port which is fully controlled by Russians after a near three month siege, said thousands more could die from cholera.

Long answer, the MGS is super cool and capable, until it breaks. And it always breaks. We had two, and every two weeks we would drop one off at the maintenance facility at a different base and pick up the ""fixed"" one. That one would usually have something break on the drive home. 

The other thing to point out is the 105 cannon isn't used on tanks today because it's underpowered. The MGS was never, ever intended to fight tanks. It's an infantry support vehicle, more specifically intended for close support in a more urban environment. It doesn't carry enough main gun ammunition to fight a prolonged fight, it doesn't carry enough Coaxial machine gun ammo to support with that, and the armor is thin enough that any round bigger than .50 is going to penetrate band blast the driver to kingdom come. 

Back to maintenance, if you don't have replacement tire of the exact correct model, you're going to quickly be unable to move the MGS. It has a flat bottom, so any mine is going to flip it. The main gun loses zero quickly, so you'll have to waste ammo(that nothing else in Ukraine uses) just to sight it back in. All the (shitty) UI on the electronics is in English, and that software is 15 years old so no one can update it. It took me years to be able to navigate the UI ""buttonology"" correctly and quickly, and I speak and read English...

&gt;	By the time Biden said it in February, Ukrainians were already preparing bomb shelters across the country and making sure people knew where they were located, but what does Biden believe Zelensky should/could have done differently?

However, he had been publicly warning them much sooner than the Feb 17 date of your link, and probably privately even sooner than that. 

I didn’t feel like trying to go thru 9000 google search results, so here’s the first thing I found that’s dated Nov 21, 2021 of a [warning](https://time.com/6116867/us-warns-russia-invade-ukraine/).

Trying to determine what Joe Biden may have been thinking is worse than sifting thru 9000 google results, but I feel like it’s pretty clear it’s assumed he could have done more to be more prepared. 

&gt;	What I’m trying to figure out what Biden is trying to say by saying it again now.

Again, I’m not a Biden fan, and I’ve been unable to find any context as to why he said this. Perhaps it was asked as a question?

Taiwan has been preparing for a Chinese invasion for decades and they have plans for these sorts of scenarios. Specifically, anything remotely like a landing strip will be sabotaged.  As for Taiwan's coast, there are not many suitable spots for an invasion-sized force to land on. These will be heavily mined, loaded with booby traps or otherwise made unusable (possibly by intentionally sinking ships to block access)

On top of that, Taiwan is a mountainous island and their military will take full advantage of that by positioning artillery on the I'm high ground, pummeling any forces that do manage to make it into the island. They have also built extensive underground bases with miles of tunnels that would be completely unaffected by missile strikes.

Basically, Taiwan is an island fortress so tough it makes Alcatraz look like a kindergarten. Is it impossible to capture? No. China could simply blockade the island and starve the population (assuming the US doesn't smash through it), but any attempt to capture it would be very costly and would utterly destroy the very reason for taking it in the first place.",8f7133b7d4dfe35f70d5928600a3f753cc3ab87b,True,False,,,,,0,1654955827,,0,{},ibz2ust,False,t3_v9vik7,False,True,t1_ibz1wj4,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v9vik7/the_chinese_delegation_walked_out_during_a_speech/ibz2ust/,1654955839,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654927027.0,

2631,[],False,,InterestDowntown29,,,[],,,,text,t2_gsowtq9q,False,False," In the earlier stages of the war Ukraine was certainly inflicting casualties at a higher ratio due to the flexible defense being benifical to a more mobile infantry focused Ukraine. However in the current static artillery duel which is occuring, Ukraine is reporting Russia uses 20X the artillery bombardment as them with 100-200 deaths and 500+ daily wounded. I cannot believe Ukraine is inflicting significantly higher losses when the main killer in combat is artillery and Russia is using 20x the amount. Even if Russia is far less accurate artillery is artillery. The rate of losses has increased significantly for both sides while the open source tracking of said losses is less reliable due to the nature of the current conflict in which most combat isn't viewable in the same way the Kyiv and the Sumy axis were. 

 Acurate sources of Ukranian losses is hard to calculate as much of western analysis is focused on Russian hardships as morale is important in war. Ultimately we're not at a general staff level privy to that sort of information, but it is certainly probable that the ratio of Ukranian to Russian losses is not nearly as positive as it was before. 

 I was saying back in March that we were arming an insurgency instead of sending the heavy weaponry needed to fight a near peer fight, but hopefully western artillery makes up the gap and Russia starts running out of shells.",409044b38543941d4c638eb30dcb639e1493fc55,True,False,,,,,0,1654955496,,0,{},ibz29bn,False,t3_v9uwdn,False,True,t1_ibyu5k6,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v9uwdn/ukraines_high_casualty_rate_could_bring_war_to/ibz29bn/,1654955513,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654926696.0,

*The front line has been moved five to seven kilometers away from Zaporizhzhia thanks to the actions of the Ukrainian military in recent weeks.*  
  
*Melitopol Mayor Ivan Fedorov said this during a nationwide television marathon, Ukrinform reports.*  
  
*""There are facts that in the last two weeks the front line has been moved away from Zaporizhia by five or seven kilometers. Therefore, Melitopol and other temporarily occupied territories will be de-occupied,"" he said.*  
  
*According to Fedorov, in February, when the Russian military invaded the Zaporizhzhia region, they had more forces than Ukraine. However, thanks to the heroic deeds of the Ukrainian military, the situation has changed dramatically.*  
  
*Commenting on the possibility of Russia holding a so-called referendum in Melitopol, Fedorov noted that residents of the city would not support it. However, he did not rule out that the Russians would hold it and make the ""picture"" they need. Fedorov stressed that such a ""referendum"" would have no legal consequences.*

My grandfather up until his death in the 90s still had a hatred of all Germans, despite almost all that committed bad acts in WW2 were long dead. Every time there was something on the TV about Germany he would say ""Bloody Jerrrys"" or ""Bloody nazis"".

We should never let our hatred of what some of a people are doing bias our judgements against all of those people.

Otherwise it just leads you to become the thing you hate.

Regarding sanctions, i can understand her somewhat. Its not good for the common people, while the elite at most suffer some discomfort, they still live well. But that's the point of sanctions, it has to hurt everyone in a country. The point of sanctions is to put pressure on the people to put pressure on the government and to weaken the economy of the target country. She should understand this. Its a shame that it has to happen that way. If there was a way of hurting the leaders without hurting the people, i'm sure it would be done.

However, i see nothing there that undermines Ukraine like you claim. The first part is a valid point, the second point is just relating how sanctions affect them.

2904,[],False,,esuil,,,[],,,,text,t2_9ndqr,False,False,"&gt; If this is all incorrect, how come the last 5 Russian wars or political takeovers have been focused on these gaps?

Because they are not focused on these gaps how you call it, they are focused on ""gathering Russian speaking countries"" or past USSR republics.  
  
If you want to get a look on real Russian reasoning, take a look at those:  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fourth_Political_Theory  
  
&gt; Currently a river is blocking and creating a natural barrier for troops. Surly “modern warfare” as you magically wave your hands to dismiss Geographical problems still exists.

Exactly. And yet the suggested video focuses on arbitrary gaps on the map, showing big rivers as non obstacle, and flats as obstacle, and you don't even blink.  
  
Russian playbook is focused on these areas, but the part about gaps is all bullshit. There are other reasons hidden in their ideology.  
  
&gt; Amateurs talk about tactics, but professionals study logistics.
  
Yeah, and you are suggesting to take ""gaps"" from the video to be taken at face value instead of actually studying them.  
  
You can see real reasons behind invasion in ""Foundation of Geopolitics"":  
&gt; Ukraine should be annexed by Russia because ""Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics"". Ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent, unless it is cordon sanitaire, which would be inadmissible.[9]
  
Their views are focusing on influences, combinations of soft with hard powers, resource control, social politics. Not some stupid gaps from 19th century geopolitics. That is not my opinion, that is something the people who created the modern Russian ideologies and views told themselves.",11018debd7def6eec6e58b120482ecef9d7e4a07,True,False,,,,,0,1654951360,,0,{},ibyv88e,False,t3_v9fz4u,False,True,t1_ibytmyv,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v9fz4u/if_russia_lays_down_its_weapons_there_is_no_war/ibyv88e/,1654951372,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654922560.0,

Yevgeny Shumilkin is going back to work on Sunday. To prepare, he pulled the familiar “M” off what had been his McDonald’s shirt and covered the “M” on his McDonald’s jacket with a Russian flag patch.

“It will be the same buns,” promised Mr. Shumilkin, who maintains the equipment at a restaurant in Moscow. “Just under a different name.”

McDonald’s restaurants are reopening in Russia this weekend, but without the Golden Arches. After the American fast-food giant pulled out this spring to protest President Vladimir V. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, a Siberian oil mogul bought its 840 Russian stores. Because almost all of the ingredients came from inside the country, he said, the restaurants could keep on serving much of the same food.

The gambit might just work — underscoring the Russian economy’s surprising resilience in the face of the one of the most intense barrages of sanctions ever meted out by the West. Three and a half months into the war, it has become clear that the sanctions — and the torrent of Western companies voluntarily leaving Russia — have failed to completely dismantle the economy or set off a popular backlash against Mr. Putin.

Russia spent much of Mr. Putin’s 22 years in power integrating into the world economy. Unraveling business ties so large and so interwoven, it turns out, is not easy.

To be sure, the effects of the sanctions will be deep and broad, with the consequences only beginning to play out. Living standards in Russia are already declining, economists and businesspeople say, and the situation is likely to get worse as stocks of imports run low and more companies announce layoffs.

Some do-it-yourself efforts by Russia may fall short of Western standards. When the first post-sanctions model of the Lada Granta — a Russian sedan co-produced by Renault before the French automaker pulled out this spring — rolled off an assembly line at a plant near the Volga on Wednesday, it lacked airbags, modern pollution controls or anti-lock brakes.

But the economic decline is not as precipitous as some experts had expected it would be after the Feb. 24 invasion. Inflation is still high, around 17 percent on an annual basis, but it has come down from a 20-year peak in April. A closely watched measure of factory activity, the S&amp;P Global Purchasing Managers’ Index, showed that Russian manufacturing expanded in May for the first time since the war began.

Behind the positive news is a combination of factors playing to Mr. Putin’s advantage. Chief among them: high energy prices, which are allowing the Kremlin to keep funding the war while raising pensions and wages to placate ordinary Russians. The country’s oil revenues are up 50 percent this year.

In addition, deft work by the Central Bank prevented a panic in the financial markets after the invasion and helped the ruble recover from its initial crash. Store shelves, for the most part, remain stocked, thanks to ample inventories and alternative import routes being established through countries like Turkey and Kazakhstan — and the fact that Russian consumers are buying less.

Even the new Lada Granta is less of a clunker than observers predicted: Despite shortages of foreign components, it will still come with power steering and power windows.

“Everything is not as bad as expected,” a Russian car website proclaimed.

The Russian economy’s survival is playing into Mr. Putin’s hands by bolstering his narrative that Russia will stand tall in the face of the West’s determination to destroy it. He met with young entrepreneurs on Thursday in a town-hall-style event, his latest effort to show that even as he waged war, he was keen to keep the economy functioning and foreign trade moving. Even if the West will not do business with Russia, he insisted, the rest of the world will.",34f7c7614d89aa2d080f449d51e6f7d3f648c54d,True,False,,,,,0,1654949642,,0,{},ibysoc2,True,t3_v9wb2b,False,True,t3_v9wb2b,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v9wb2b/mcdonalds_is_back_moscow_style_as_russian_economy/ibysoc2/,1654949657,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654920842.0,

I didn’t say that this latest interpretation of events is incorrect. I am not saying that it is correct either. I am not making a value judgement on the statement that this is all a masterful strategy to grind down Russian combat capability. So I don’t know why you wasted so much space and effort addressing a point I didn’t make. But ok, your misinterpretation of my comment is much more understandable than the other guy’s, so let’s move on to what actually was my point.

What I am point out is that no matter what happens in this battle (and I would now add - elsewhere in this war) - a positive (for Ukraine) spin is put on it.

When you look at the reporting on this battle specifically it doesn’t matter if the Ukrainian army is advancing or being forced to retreat - every single episode is described as some sort of victory. It makes a unbiased observer very skeptical of outlets which publish such headlines and of Redditors who share them.

Your argument that this one specific instance of Russians walking back their position is worse than this specific instance of the Ukrania side flip-flopping on their narrative doesn’t really address the trust issue. The argument is literally “well look at Russia’s propaganda which is even worse than ours”. That doesn’t make your propaganda not propaganda and any more trustworthy.",c690bcb2154d5d5f4ea6a87f93d9f119e2668b35,True,False,,,,,0,1654949579,,0,{},ibysl6e,False,t3_v9jcv0,False,True,t1_ibye7nr,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v9jcv0/ukraines_strategy_in_severodonetsk_coming_into/ibysl6e/,1654949590,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654920779.0,

Because most of it is utter outdated bullshit from 19th century geopolitics, not modern understanding of war or geography.  
  
I watched the video. It is utterly useless. It shows you the map and tells ""here are the gaps that can be used to invade, Russia wants to control it"". What qualifies for a gap? How is a gap determined? Why some places that could be gap, are not indicated as gaps in this theory? Why some places that are not really gaps anymore, are shown as gaps?  
  
Basically, it shows the foundation of the whole idea - gaps... but then just skims over and expects you to assume that ""this is how it is"" and builds on assumption that all of that stuff is correct.    
  
But in 21th century geopolitics don't work just on geographical features or gaps. There is resource control, social politics, techno gaps, weapons that can be deployed bypassing ""the gaps"" etc.   
  
Even if gaps thing was true, it would be stupid to run modern conquest based on it, because there is more to geopolitical security than that. And in this case gaps part is not even correctly researched, it just shows some arbitrary maps that tell you ""these are the gaps"" with no context.  
  
For example it uses Kazakhstan flats/desert east of Caspian sea as part of impassible terrain so that it can demonstrate ""gap"" east from it. There are fucking ROADS across it now. And without roads, it is just dry flats. You could take civilian 4-wheel and drive across it. Like it is not a obstacle. It is literally flat terrain with nothing in it. It WAS a obstacle. In 19th century. When people used horses or traveled on foot. Claiming it to be an natural barrier in 21th century is laughable.",cd57ff1d43075465e6a237a878b1bb7caf63d143,True,False,,,,,0,1654948054,,0,{},ibyqhhg,False,t3_v9fz4u,False,True,t1_ibybcil,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v9fz4u/if_russia_lays_down_its_weapons_there_is_no_war/ibyqhhg/,1654948068,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654919254.0,

A squad code-named ""Molotki"" (Hammers) of the Special Forces of the Security Service of Ukraine, needs your help!


My name is Vladislav Tishchuk, and I'm helping my close friend Igor and his squad code-named ""Molotki"" (Hammers) to raise funds to purchase equipment and supplies.


Igor, along with his brothers in arms, is currently fighting Russian invaders to bring peace and freedom to Ukraine. 


Before the war, Igor owned a hunting and fishing store in Kyiv. He is an avid outdoorsman and loves nothing more than spending time in nature.


However, the war changed everything...


When Russian invaders began their assault on Ukraine, Igor knew he had to take up arms and fight for his country. 

The day the war began, he closed his store, donated all the goods to the army, and joined the territorial defense. His brother and friends from the hunter and fishing community signed up for the same unit to begin their fight against the invaders. When the situation escalated on the outskirts of Kyiv, his unit performed difficult tasks to defend the city. In one of the battles, Igor was wounded and even filmed this moment on video. 


After plenty of successful missions, the unit was reformed into a squad codenamed ""Molotki"".


Unfortunately, the formalization procedure is complicated and part of this squad is not receiving enough support. The lack of support means these brave souls have to pay for fuel and food out of their pockets. 


Not to mention the lack of expensive special equipment that is very much needed. 


The main squad's objectives are to identify enemy equipment, pinpoint their location for attack and engage them with precision strikes. To do this, they need night vision devices like monoculars or goggles; thermal imaging cameras (which can see heat sources); quadcopters that let them survey areas; and laptops and other equipment to successfully communicate information.


The total cost of all equipment and supplies is about $53,500. This includes direct delivery to them. 


On behalf of all Ukrainians, I ask you to help them! We are fighting for the freedom not only of our country but of the whole world. 

Together, we can fight back against Russia so that their terrible sway does not reach farther than Ukraine!",478ac33d412c9409d1db33e8158dbc1b255335c0,True,False,,,,,0,1654946591,,0,{},ibyoma1,True,t3_v9vinz,False,True,t3_v9vinz,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v9vinz/the_warriors_of_the_ukrainian_special_forces_are/ibyoma1/,1654946605,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654917791.0,

Its ""us vs them"", it's any foreigner and non Russian must be a mercenary who is plotting on the demise of ""Great Russian People"".  It doesn't matter that this guy was living and studying in Ukraine or married to Ukrainian woman like other guys and were citizens of Ukraine, the whole concept of citizenship is unclear to them. Because they are not citizens, they are just a big serf congregation which loves their emperor and wants to make other people serfs too, with a lesser social status than them of course, they are serfs of the first grade. In that serf congregation morals simply do not apply to the outsiders of the tribe.

Breaking in someone's home to kill you and steal your shit and then accusing you of resisting doesn't bothers them one bit too, they don't see the issue here, after all you as non russian has no right to do a harm to a russian which is killing you, they see themselves as a higher sort of people, and they openly proclaim that they should have the special rights to do anything that nobody else can do back to them in return. (This even resonates in a language of higher resolution geopolitics, they wanted ""special status"", above all the rules for other countries, they don't wanna be ""just a country"").

 It's really is a stone age tribe from the Moscow swamps cheering and laughing as they kill any ""foreigner"" who gets caught in their grabby paws. They get a real joy from it, they gonna make a public show out of it.  Just as this tribe is trying to imitate a process of real trial and law that they saw in the West, but there is not anything even close to resembling law and order in Russia. Putin should be in prison even according to fake laws of this grand terrorist organization, (Article 353 of criminal codex. Planning, Preparing, Unleashing, or Waging on Aggressive War).   There is a prerogative figure of speech in Russian language, pretty commonly used, that translates as literally ""non russian"" ""ты че, нерусский что ли?"" 

They even know it about themselves, there is a moment in cult following Russian Movie ""Brother 2"" (they were also rolling this movie in theaters when full scale invasion started) where main hero while being drunk talks to a guy and says to him something among the lines of ""soon you're all Americans will be dealt with, there would be no US"" - and the girl says to him ""He is French"", -he responds ""i don't care, what's the difference"" lol. There is also quite a visceral racist moment in a movie, and a lot of xenophobia to any non Russians, Ukrainians included of course. They glorify it about themselves, they love it. By the way, lovely ""opposition leader of future free democratic Russia"" Alexey Navalny was quoting this movie in a positive manner too ""водочки мне принеси, мальчик"" when he was on a plane.

What the most surreal thing for me is to watch at some of those people in liberal democratic societies, (people which Russians themselves derogatively call ""Pindos"", somebody should tell them)  and talk about Russians and Russia as some kind of crack dream they imagined into their heads and wished into reality, noticing and magnifying only good parts while papering over stone cold eyes, unwashed beard and corpse like ideological ancient breath and calls for more authoritarianism, blood and expansion of the likes of Dugin, turning off and laughing at people who lived for decades with Russians (the same way some American youth brainwashed by their idiot Marxist professors ""listens"" to eastern Europeans or people of Cuba who witnessed communism pretty closely historically themselves.) 

The same people, fucking delusional clueless professors of universities, educated into stupidity, who were saying earlier that Medvedev could be the future of free democratic Russia with a straight fucking face. Same people, who strip off Ukraine of any agency or sovergneity or dignity, the Mearsheimer's of this world. People, who historically were giving Pulitzer prizes to each other for spreading Stalinist propaganda about Holodomor like Walter Duranty.  People, 300 iq military clownalysts who predicted that Ukraine will politely lie down in front of Russian tracks in 3 days. There is quite some rot in academia and journalism, worldwide.

The world is in this state because of so much delusional incompetent fools and populists take such high positions of power and influence the decision making, and infantile state of people prefer to live in a world of wishful thinking, in the end of history, where nothing is happening, in the world of idiotic ""liberalization trough trade"". While some people with roughly speaking 3 classes of  education already predicted the full scale invasion like Quirimli journalist Ayder Muzhdabaev in Ukraine back in 2018, for [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69Ii-DByv1Q). He was saying that he is talking to a wall. 

Some European politicians of that time were feeling ""deep concern"" about the situation and called for restrain from ""both sides"", how cynical. The response of the West to Russia's attack on Ukraine's navy and kidnapping the sailors in 2018 did not discouraged Putin from further actions, this was the last big test, after test of Crimea, and Donbass that's now a fact. Same thing applies to some people of Ukraine, by the way, the delusional naval gazing dream of what if Russia will not attack, maybe we don't need NATO, eastern, ""russified"" part of population of Ukraine had these ideas historically. A lot of people in Ukrainian journalism and politics are personally responsible for dumbing down, brainwashing and relaxing the population and have some blood on their lips. The cause and effect is quite direct some times.  Russian TV and agents of influence helped of course too, they felt too liberal and brazen in Ukraine, any attack on them was perceived as attack on ""freedom of speech"" to the West. As if the Russian official doctrine of hybrid warfare wasn't made public to the western experts (it did). Price for those miscalculations is huge.

A nascent insurgency made up of civilians or former soldiers provided information that aided Ukraine’s attack on two Russian bases, according to a senior Ukrainian military official.

While a lack of weapons, ammunition and equipment hampers the Ukrainian military, there are signs that a nascent partisan insurgency is growing in potency, allowing Ukrainian forces to deliver deadly strikes on Russian-controlled territory even in areas where it is dangerous and sometimes impossible to commit troops.

This week, partisan scouts working for Ukraine’s military behind enemy lines directed artillery attacks on two Russian bases in the occupied Kherson region that killed scores of enemy soldiers, according to a senior Ukrainian military official with knowledge of the attacks.

In one episode this week, the scouts approached a Russian army installation in the village of Chkalove, and discovered many foreign fighters stationed at the base along with Russian soldiers and heavy weaponry, the senior official said. They fed the coordinates for the base to a Ukrainian artillery unit stationed about 12 miles away.

The Ukrainians then pulverized the base with shells, killing scores of fighters just after midnight on Thursday, said the senior official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military operations.

Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, confirmed the attack and said about 200 fighters had been killed.

Later that day, scouts directed another artillery attack, this time on a resort complex in Stara Zburivka, near the mouth of the Dnipro River, killing dozens of enemy soldiers, including two generals, the senior official said. One of the generals was from the Russian army and another from Russia’s counterintelligence service, the F.S.B., the senior military official said.

The scouts are local partisans who aid the Ukrainian military on Russian-occupied territory. They might be former soldiers or simply civilians gathering information like the location of enemy units. They can be men pushing potato carts, or farmers, or a grandmother with a cellphone.

Ukrainian partisans have claimed credit for attacking Russian trains; targeting Russian proxies appointed to local government administrations; killing Russian soldiers; and supporting Ukrainian military efforts. Their support can prove crucial, both in southern Ukraine where Russia has captured territory, and in the east where Ukraine finds itself outgunned and fighting to hold onto its land.

Details of the two attacks this week could not be independently verified. The Russian foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

The strike in Chkalove occurred near an area of active fighting in Ukraine’s south. To determine the number of dead, spotters counted body bags as they were loaded onto rescue vehicles, the senior official said.

The death toll in the strike was apparently so high because the shells struck a cache of munitions, sparking an explosion and a blaze that burned for six hours early Thursday morning, the official said.

The official said that before the attack, the partisans approached some of the foreign fighters and after trying to speak with them, surmised that they were Arab. The foreign fighters appeared to be living in tents near buildings occupied by Russian troops, the official said. He said they were possibly part of a contingent of Syrian troops that arrived in Russia three weeks ago.

It has long been rumored that Syrian fighters would join Russia’s fight in Ukraine, but there has been no official confirmation of this.

Mr. Arestovych, the adviser to Mr. Zelensky, said it was the first concrete evidence of the presence of Arab fighters in Ukraine.

The exact shape and size of the insurgency in southern Ukraine is unclear and the resistance to Russian occupation can come in many forms — from helping direct attacks on enemy forces in coordination with the Ukrainian military to posting leaflets on street corners to demoralize the occupiers. The goal always, according to scholars of insurgency, is to make sure the enemy never feels safe.

On June 3, the Ukrainian military command in southern Ukraine reported, without providing any evidence, that Russians were changing behaviors out of fear of the growing resistance.

“The leadership of the occupation authorities move around with large numbers of guards, in bulletproof vests, in armored cars,” the military command reported. “There is fear for their lives.”

During the first months of the occupation, witnesses described how Russian forces tried to locate anyone with a military or security background in the region to interrogate them. Amid continuing attacks by insurgents, witnesses have described increasingly draconian efforts to find possible rebels.

All traffic in and out of Kherson to Ukrainian-controlled land is now closed, and those who do move around can face a maze of checkpoints, with occupation forces checking cellphones for hints of pro-Ukrainian sympathies.

The partisan resistance began in the first days of the war, when civilians armed with Molotov cocktails joined in attacks on invading Russian columns. But as Russia’s hold on the south deepened, it has had to become more clandestine.

Ukrainian news media have reported that the underground resistance in occupied territories is coordinated by a unit of its armed forces called the Special Operations Forces. The division was formed after attempts to build an insurgency to counter the Russian-backed separatists in the eastern Donbas region failed in 2015.

The Ukrainian government has set up a virtual Center of National Resistance that provides instructions for things like setting up ambushes and how to handle being arrested.

“In order to become an invisible avenger whom the occupiers will fear, it is necessary to know tactics, medicine, internet security, homemade weapons, and nonviolent actions,” the center’s website says.

In one example of the tips the government is giving to the resistance, it recently published an online step-by-step guide to hot-wiring Soviet-era armor.

Several attacks on Russian-appointed officials in the Kherson and Zhaporizhzhia regions have been reported by both Ukrainian and Russian officials — although the attacks are portrayed in vastly different ways. The Ukrainians praise the resistance. The Russians call the attacks acts of terror.

Andrei Shevchik, the pro-Kremlin mayor of Enerhodar — who was installed shortly after Russian forces occupied the Ukrainian city on the Dnipro River — was outside his mother’s home when he was seriously wounded in a blast. That appeared to be the work of insurgents, Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency reported on May 22, citing an emergency services worker in the city as a source.

[This image was taken during a visit to Mariupol organized by the Russian military, and shows the head of the Enerhodar city administration, Andriy Shevchik. He was injured in a blast in Enerhodar.]

Last week, an explosion struck close to the office of Yevgeny Balitsky, a pro-Kremlin Ukrainian official in the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol. Pro-Kremlin authorities in the city explicitly blamed Ukrainian partisans, and Russia’s Investigative Committee — the equivalent of the F.B.I. — blamed it on “Ukrainian saboteurs.”

Mr. Arestovych, the adviser to Mr. Zelensky, said there was a long tradition of waging guerrilla warfare in southern Ukraine, where the vast steppes leave the enemy little room to hide.

“Partisans are fighting very actively,” he said last month on his YouTube channel. “Both the Russian troops and the occupation administration are well aware of this.”",ee663943abca042b8f704a9e0e1e139917bd4813,True,False,,,,,0,1654941365,,0,{},ibyipeb,True,t3_v9uas3,False,True,t3_v9uas3,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v9uas3/scouts_working_for_ukraines_military_behind_enemy/ibyipeb/,1654941376,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654912565.0,

Scholz Keywords: stupid, serpentine, immaturity, liar, dim. 


[Daily Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/05/30/germans-turning-failing-leaders/)

Olaf Scholz, Germany's chancellor 
‘I’m not as stupid as Kaiser Wilhelm II,” Olaf Scholz told journalists last week, voicing his fear that Europe is sleepwalking into a world war. Yet many people are wondering whether the German Chancellor is using his country’s burden of historical guilt to wriggle out of his pledge to supply Ukraine with the tanks, armoured vehicles and artillery it desperately needs.

The newspaper Die Welt has revealed that, in nine weeks, Germany has supplied none of the promised heavy equipment. Only light arms and defensive weapons have been delivered. Endless excuses have been offered by Berlin, from claims of secret Nato deals to attempts to blame the manufacturers. None of which has turned out to hold water. “Militarily, Ukraine is simply being left in the lurch by Berlin,” according to Andrij Melnyk, the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany.

Scholz’s Nato counterparts are now asking whether his word can be trusted at all. President Duda of Poland has been scathing about Berlin’s failure to honour its pledge to replace equipment that his country sent to Ukraine.

Indeed, Germany’s image as the leading power in Europe, already compromised by its addiction to Russian energy, has collapsed. With the exception of Hungary, the whole of Central, Eastern and Northern Europe has joined the Anglo-American camp, demanding a tougher line towards Moscow. Berlin is no longer taken seriously among the countries most threatened by Russia – which are also among those that suffered most at the hands of the Nazis. Scholz’s serpentine manoeuvres have cast doubt on the sincerity of postwar Germany’s efforts to restore its reputation, and lessened the power of the motto “Never again”.

It could have been very different. When Scholz announced his Zeitenwende (“turning point”) after the Russian invasion, the world sat up and took notice. His enhanced military commitment to Nato and Ukraine seemed to herald a new epoch, with Germany emerging from Angela Merkel’s shadow. In the 100 days since, however, his geopolitical immaturity has been painfully obvious.

Instead of turning Germany into the arsenal of democracy, Scholz has strung Volodymyr Zelensky along with empty promises. Meanwhile Berlin’s billions continue to pour into Putin’s coffers: blood money for Russian gas and oil.

Together with Emmanuel Macron and Mario Draghi, the German Chancellor has formed a triumvirate of appeasers, continuing to negotiate with Putin and entertaining concessions in return for a ceasefire that would freeze the conflict and leave Russia occupying vast tracts of Ukraine.

The latest round of phone calls to Moscow were touted as a chance to lift the Russian blockade of Ukrainian grain supplies. But the Kremlin is clear that shipments will only be permitted by its Black Sea fleet in return for the removal of sanctions. With this prevarication and bargaining, the Zeitenwende is unravelling.

But perhaps most importantly, Scholz is no longer even in tune with German public opinion. In the past month, his party, the Social Democrats, has done badly in two regional elections. Much of the public consider that the gap between what their leader says and what he does is now so wide that he looks like a liar.

Meanwhile, the Greens and the liberal Free Democrats, his coalition partners, are deeply uncomfortable. Unless Scholz can restore his credibility fast, it is no longer inconceivable that one or more parties could switch sides, bringing down the government just six months after it took office.

Abandoning the caution of the Merkel era, the opposition Christian Democrats are back in the game. Their new leader, Friedrich Merz, has visited Kyiv – unlike the thin-skinned Scholz, who was mocked by Ambassador Melnyk as a “silly sausage”. Within the coalition it is the Greens, especially Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, who are setting the pace. On Ukraine, Ms Baerbock seems closer to hawkish conservatives such as Norbert Röntgen than she does to Scholz.

The fresh start promised for Germany is long forgotten. Instead, its embattled Chancellor is simply out of his depth. Perhaps his comparison with Wilhelm II, however ill-advised, was apt after all. Scholz may not be as dim as the Kaiser, but he looks very like an emperor with no clothes.",5d9a9e2c9f80a52cfd7485b41c0a5873e48d3c88,True,False,,,,,0,1654939557,,0,{},ibygtfq,False,t3_v9rqyi,False,True,t1_ibyfa7p,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v9rqyi/poland_signed_one_of_largest_in_the_last_30_years/ibygtfq/,1654939569,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654910757.0,

SDonetsk may yet fall, and Ukrainians and their partisans are ridiculous at times, but the only narrative that counts is the one that you end up listening to. 

Zelensky and Co are outright labeling their losses in the Donbass around 100 a day. SDonetsk is a slug fest. Those are accurate narratives. This is a war of attrition. 

If Ukrainians want to spin this war of attrition as benefiting them more than Russia, that is actually not an unreasonable narrative for them to be making right now.

Taking and keeping occupied territory, including entire cities, works counter to that strategy and puts Ukrainian forces and civilian infrastructure at the mercy of Russian artillery.

Later, when Western artillery is entirely online, Ukrainian forces will be able to optimize this strategy as their newer enhanced counter-battery artillery with more extended range than the Russian artillery will force Russian artillery to stand off and not be able to lay siege to Ukrainian cities with their superiority in numbers of artillery pieces which will no longer matter as much; thus forcing Russian infantry into urban warfare without artillery.  

Ukraine has the advantage in urban warfare.

This strategy requires a lot of courage and endurance, which Ukrainian forces have demonstrated.  Trainers are training on the new equipment now.  

What percentage of pledged new Western counter-battery artillery equipment aid is online today?  5%? 10%?  By July or August, it may be triple that or closer to 100%.  Check back in at the end of August.  

This conflict is only three months old.  That is nothing.  Any analysts or media outlets calling this a stalemate at this point are fools or manipulators.  

It would be wonderful if the trajectory of this conflict were crystal clear and highly discernable, but as of today, that is not the case, maybe by the end of August.  

Now,  as soon as the trajectory does become clear each sides’ analysts will do the math and possibly then be prepared for realistic negotiations.  So, eventually expect and be prepared for an armistice offer from which ever party likes the math the least.

So, in some sense we are all waiting on the math, what is called a limits problem in calculus.  My common sense tells me two things, even without the math, Russia has lost this war from a moral stand point, especially it's standing with most of Europe, Russia’s largest trading partner after China, and much of the world.  The second is that even though the math might shorten the war, wars usually do not solve our problems.  

Last the math is going to tell someone this war is pointless, but it never needed mathematical genius to know that in the first place.

Almost by definition, all energy generation has some level of waste or problems. Other renewable systems don't have anything as big as turbine blades but generate waste in production e.g. of metal parts for hydro or drilling tunnels. 

The actual quantities of high level waste from nuclear are small but because it's extremely nasty chemicals *and* radioactive, they have to be stored with extreme care, embedded in glass and concrete. Low level is in a sense worse because only a small amount of it is radioactive but you never know which so huge quantities have to be stored as if they could be dangerous. 

Fossil fuels generate huge amounts of waste during extraction. Fracking for gas causes vast areas of land to be poisoned. Coal burning leaves tonnes of ash. Oil has both problems. Remember this is a problem associated with the fuel continuously fed into the installation so the quantities are huge compared to e.g. turbine blades which are long term part of the system and rarely changed.

Given all that, my question is, why would anyone mention turbine blades? It's a tiny tiny problem in the energy generation market.

About number 2: I am unsure which country you are from, but in multiple countries verbal contracts are binding (the issue being the ability to Proof smth). 

Also, Like you quoted ""there is no intention to enlarge NATO to the east"" (1989). This is from our mindset not a binding agreement, it is just a verbal note of Intention. Stuff changes over years.

The issue here is, that in the russian mindset, they saw it as a binding acknowledgement that the NATO would not interfere in russian domestic politics.

Russia (also China and some other countries) think in hegemonial spheres. So there is a major power that rules a defined area, and minor powers who are to a certain degree independent, but only to the degree that it doesnt oppose the hegemonials interests. So accepting those areas which russia has a Claim on (the Former soviet members) into NATO, is from their perspective NATO becoming active against russia interests.


The real topic here is the totally different Idea of how the world works:

You have the Western View of countries being able to make own decisions (its not like NATO forced Poland etc to join), while other countries believe in spheres of influence. So it is a Clash of mindsets.

You can blame the NATO that it was very aware about the issue, but in the end, they followed their Ideals instead of submitting to the Idea of hegemonial Powers.",921d03980ef1827e593fddfa8444872ccb21dd87,True,False,,,,,0,1654932066,,0,{},iby8rnq,False,t3_v8uj0u,False,True,t1_iby2ran,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v8uj0u/welcome_to_bulgaria_where_the_ukraine_war_is/iby8rnq/,1654932080,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654903266.0,

LOL that's cute for two reasons:

1. You think that Russian nuclear forces are magically immune from Russian corruption which runs rampant through their military.  ""No comrade, of *course* I didn't use Chinesium components for key systems while pocketing the fat contract difference!""  All the way down the ranks to Corporal Sergey selling his platoon's diesel for extra income.

2. All these North Korean sounding threats of nuclear Armageddon assume that such actions carry no blowback.  Sure Russia could pop off a few hundred ICBMs before anybody noticed, but what comes next?  Vodka and caviar, or a return strike?  MAD 101.  
3.

Then you need to schedule that point against the relevant inputs. 

My pick: Russia's foreign currency reserves. When Russia's foreign currency reserves run out one critical thing will happen: they will have to transact all foreign trade in rubles. Every single import. What happens to the ruble, then forced to be used (instead of essentially frozen, like now)? The ruble begins or accelerates hyperinflation. The purchasing power, the national wealth of Russia, quickly evaporates. They can't pay their soldiers (in anything they value), they can't import the still-wide range of consumer goods that ordinary Russians have come to expect for anything less than absurd prices. It will be a death knell for their ability to wage a foreign war.

So, how far are we from there, and how do we get there faster?

Russia planned ahead, and stockpiled foreign currency reserves in the lead up to February 24. They had some $600b total. Fortunately, someone at the US Treasury came up with an unprecedented sanctions feature to do something about that: Russia's sovereign assets in Western banks were *all* frozen. Including about half of that war chest. 

So starting with $300b, you just need to know: Russia's exports (which are foreign currencies being sent to Russia) versus imports (foreign currencies leaving Russia). How do we get that to zero faster? We murder Russian exports. 

My pick is all that gas Europe keeps buying. Most of it can't go anywhere else (unlike oil, which China can and would buy).",0ec5ddf2e95fd17741beaa556a4f009c34f5e233,True,False,,,,,0,1654928147,,0,{},iby463l,False,t3_v9ma34,False,True,t1_ibxczjf,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v9ma34/russiaukraine_latest_moscow_able_to_fight_war_for/iby463l/,1654928161,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654899347.0,

Russian central bank: impact of sanctions still unclear  
Moscow (AP) - The impact of Western sanctions on the Russian economy is not yet clear, according to the central bank. So far, the consequences have been less acute than expected, Central Bank President Elvira Nabiullina said Friday in Moscow. That also demonstrates the ability of businesses to adapt, she said. However, she said it is premature to say that the sanctions have had their full effect.  
  
""The situation is uncertain, the situation is evolving,"" Nabiullina said. She also said that the restructuring of the economy is an ongoing process, so conclusions are not yet possible. According to her, the government is preparing a possible legal challenge to the EU sanctions, but she acknowledged that such a step would not be easy. At the briefing, the central bank also announced a cut in key interest rates to the level before the attack on Ukraine.",bf4c8ad558c79f97488f85ee36d198fdbfad0c49,True,False,,,,,0,1654924500,,0,{},ibxzgla,True,t3_v9qfvo,False,True,t3_v9qfvo,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v9qfvo/according_to_the_russian_central_bank_president/ibxzgla/,1654924517,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1654895700.0,

&gt; The reopening is timed to coincide with Russia Day, celebrating the country&amp;#039;s independence, at the very same location in Moscow&amp;#039;s Pushkin Square where McDonald&amp;#039;s first opened in Russia in 1990.Then it was seen as a potent symbol of the opening up of the old Soviet economy to western companies, but now more than 1,000 former McDonald&amp;#039;s restaurants in Russia will be part of a new chain, partly as a result of western sanctions on economic activity with Russia.

&gt; The new logo features a burger and two french fries in the shape of an M, although the name of the new brand is yet to be revealed.

&gt; Critics of the new logo have pointed out its similarity to that of the Marriott hotel chain, which operates in Russia.

I like to argue with Russians - but I've given up trying to convince them of anything since those who are still looking at western media and know what's happening and are fine with it actually believe the deaths of millions of Ukrainians is acceptable to change the world to the Russian vision of the future. 

And what is equally troubling is these Russians have a very long-term, big picture of how Russia can become the dominant power in the world and take advantage of things like global warming melting ice opening up artic shipping route. 

But realistically looking at the hole Russia has dug for them - even if they ""win"" in Ukraine, dragging out the war and forcing Zelensky to surrender territory - then what? How can Russia afford the billions needed to rebuild?  They want to reopen Mariupol beaches - but how many years will it take to get rid of the stench of thousands of dead bodies?  The mass exodus out of Russia of the educated in the last 20 years has taken away anyone to build up Russia technology and engineering, and they're left with generation after generation of people with fetal alcohol syndrome.

These elite Russians wanting to become a world power may have delusions of a great Russian power, but no way to actually execute those plans. Unless it involves nukes.

And the exercises yesterday with US submariners changing crews on the sea was directly to show Russia that they can't just nuke Bangar ME to take out the US nuclear-carrying submarines.

Now, we have seen this see-saw back forth for Severodonetsk at least three times so far. UA has the high ground across the river in Slovyansk, giveing the artillery greater range, and tremendous visibility into the Severodonetsk. This negates some of Russia's artillery superiority. Russia have clearly made Severodonetsk a priority. Also given that they have repeated terrible operations several times so far (river crossing, the airport Chirnhov I think it's spelled), it's easy to beieve they are funneling troops into a wood chipper.

&gt; as well as the political theory of not wanting to lose territory which cannot be regained during negotiations afterwards.

This is false, the UA goal is to drive Russia out of Ukraine, time is on their side. They will grow stronger as Russia grows weaker.

The Ukrainians have been able to push them back around Kherson, not a huge amount but they've been able to do it because the Russians have thrown everything into taking Severodonetsk. My bet is that they want to declare those areas liberated for their domestic audience, and are hoping the food and gas pinch cause the west to pressure Ukraine into a peace that lets them keep what they're sitting on. I don't think that's going to happen.

What I believe is going to happen is that they'll throw everything in Severodonetsk encircle the city or take it, try to offer a ceasefire that Ukraine won't take, and find they're fighting a war and they've got jack left in the tank. They've pretty clearly worked through their stocks of long range missile. When they're hitting far from the front lines it's pretty random and not what I'd call sustained. The advance is also moving at a crawl. They started this offensive back in April, and the breakthrough at Popasna that started the encirclement of Severodonetsk started May 20, and they still haven't managed to complete it. I don't think they've got the truck capacity to move themselves or their howitzers around effectively.
