The realities of the Ukraine was has laid waste to fifty years of Chinese planning and they now realise all of their planning for the last 50 years has to be torn up as unlike Ukraine, Taiwan is better armed, better trained, has been preparing for that war for decades and on is a island so much harder to invade and more mountainous.

And the sanctions packages if applied to China would be devastating as unlike Russia which is a net exporter of food and energy, China imports both.

Russian? Should die a painful death, we don’t care if you‘re in the opposition or not, you‘re all the same scum born and raised with an Imperialist and colonial mindset so deep, it’ll never go away whatever you say or do. 

Moreover, the educated and liberal are even worse, because they seem rational and friendly and might bring the country back to good standing in the world if they‘ll by some unimaginable twist of luck come to power and a strong Russia is the last thing we would ever want, again because russianness can be never cured and is evil in its purest form, and that would be just a bomb waiting to blow up. 

You should have thought ahead, you should have been smart, you should have been brave and self organizing to stop the oppression machine in your country that was being built and fortified since time immemorial, and especially the last twenty years. We don’t care if that machine was hunting and grinding down the best of you and severe trauma and suffering was being passed with mothers milk. To us, you are the machine. It should be taken to pieces, completely destroyed for the best of humanity. 

Don’t tell us how hard it is for you, without your Gucci bags and McDonalds, we are dying right now just and only because of you. Every drop of blood, every child and woman raped is your responsibility, done by your country, your leaders, your people and with your support. What a bunch of genocidal maniacs, you are all worse than non-human. We will never forgive. 

You went to a protest or two, how cute. And the result? Look, when the police beet up our students, there was a million out on our streets the next day and then Maidan happened. Why didn’t you do your own Maidan? Are you saying your siloviki where monitoring the Ukrainian situation from day one and funneled billions of their oil money into creating anti-maidan structures within every layer of power in your society and feeding you propaganda 24/7 that things are great and you don’t need no revolution? And most of you fell for it? Pathetic. That just proves you are worthless and we‘ll never have sympathy for you. Prove me wrong — take to the streets right now and change the regime. You didn’t? Thought so. The only good Russian is a room temperature Russian.

SLOVYANSK, Ukraine — The euphoria that accompanied Ukraine’s unforeseen early victories against bumbling Russian troops is fading as Moscow adapts its tactics, recovers its stride and asserts its overwhelming firepower against heavily outgunned Ukrainian forces.  
  
Newly promised Western weapons systems are arriving, but too slowly and in insufficient quantities to prevent incremental but inexorable Russian gains in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine, which is now the focus of the fight.  
  
The Ukrainians are still fighting back, but they are running out of ammunition and suffering casualties at a far higher rate than in the initial stages of the war. Around 200 Ukrainian soldiers are now being killed every day, up from 100 late last month, an aide to President Volodymyr Zelensky told the BBC on Friday — meaning that as many as 1,000 Ukrainians are being taken out of the fight every day, including those who are injured.  
  
...  
  
The Russians are still making mistakes and are also losing men and equipment, albeit at a lesser rate than in the first months of the conflict. In one sign that they are suffering equipment shortages, they have been seen on videos posted on social media hauling hundreds of mothballed, Soviet-era T-62 tanks out of storage to be sent to Ukraine.  
  
But the overall trajectory of the war has unmistakably shifted away from one of unexpectedly dismal Russian failures and tilted in favor of Russia as the demonstrably stronger force.  
  
Ukrainian and U.S. hopes that the new supplies of Western weaponry would enable Ukraine to regain the initiative and eventually retake the estimated 20 percent of Ukrainian territory captured by Russia since its Feb. 24 invasion are starting to look premature, said Oleksandr V. Danylyuk, an adviser to the Ukrainian government on defense and intelligence issues.  
  
...  
  
But the odds against the Ukrainians are starting to look overwhelming, said Danylyuk, the government adviser.  
  
“The Russians are using long-range artillery against us, often without any response, because we don’t have the means,” he said. “They can attack from dozens of kilometers away and we can’t fire back. We know all the coordinates for all their important targets, but we don’t have the means to attack.”  
  
Ukraine has now almost completely run out of ammunition for the Soviet-era weapons systems that were the mainstay of its arsenal, and the Eastern European countries that maintained the same systems have run out of surplus supplies to donate, Danylyuk said. Ukraine urgently needs to shift to longer-range and more sophisticated Western systems, but those have only recently been committed, and in insufficient quantities to match Russia’s immense firepower, he said.  
  
Russia is firing as many as 50,000 artillery rounds a day into Ukrainian positions, and the Ukrainians can only hit back with around 5,000 to 6,000 rounds a day, he said. The United States has committed to deliver 220,000 rounds of ammunition — enough to match Russian firepower for around four days.

Lysyshansk will be a tougher challenge because the Ukrainians control the high ground, and the Russians’ artillery strength is less of an advantage in close urban combat, said Konrad Muzyka, director of the Warsaw-based Rochan Consulting defense consultancy. Russia may find it difficult to sustain its recent gains for much beyond that, given the losses it has suffered so far, he said.  
  
But if the Russians manage to breach the river, they could start to make rapid advances, he said.

If Russia successfully crosses the river, my concern is that the Russians will enter Donetsk with their full might, and then the Ukrainians might be overwhelmed,” he said.",9ffdac6166dd10986c62e21bb00eeaaed82e07a5,True,False,,,,,0,1654920562,,0,{},ibxtqy3,True,t3_v9pfbx,False,True,t3_v9pfbx,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/v9pfbx/ukraine_is_running_out_of_ammunition_as_prospects/ibxtqy3/,1654920574,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1654891762.0

&gt;The status of “prisoner of war” (POW) is legally protected, with a specific definition and rights that attach to it under international law. The Third Geneva Convention of 1949 and the First Additional Protocol of 1977 set out who is entitled to POW status, and how they must be treated by the state that detains them during an armed conflict.

&gt;Based on media reports, Aslin and Pinner appear to have been integrated into the Ukrainian armed forces, serving in the Marines (as opposed to merely fighting alongside them), having apparently been in Ukraine for several years.

&gt;This would suggest they fall squarely within the definition of persons entitled to POW status. It also means they are lawful “combatants” – a related status that entitles them to take part in hostilities against the enemy.

&gt;Under Convention III of 1949, combatants include ***restrictively*** members of regular armed forces, participants in a levée en masse, and members of irregular forces belonging to a party to an IAC, including resistance movements. However, at least irregular forces must fulfil four conditions, namely being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates, having a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance, carrying arms openly, and conducting their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war (Art. 4(A) of GC III). Under Additional Protocol I, all organized armed groups under a command responsible to a party to an IAC and subject to an internal disciplinary system enforcing inter alia compliance with IHL fall under the unified concept of ‘armed forces’. Members of those groups are combatants.

This was inevitable for many reasons and after Russia moved a bunch of its BTG's out of the south and repositioned them to fight in Severodonetsk and that region due to the major losses they were having up there. So its the perfect time to strike at Kherson and make some headway with so few Russian troops there vs a few weeks ago.

Not to mention setting up all the Harpoon and Neptunes in the area to possibly even strike at or near Sevastopol.
