I don't think they have a manpower problem, certainly not more so than Russia. What they're most vocal about is their lack of heavy artilllery. I hope the US will send them more M777, Poland also has close to 1,000 pieces of self-propelled artillery.

&gt;Capitalism needs endless growth, and assumes endless resource (both energy and demographic) availability to fuel it

Why?  And how do you define ""capitalism""?  Nothing I know of in economics states that capitalism requires endless growth.  Japan's population peaked in the 2000's.  Poland's population peaked in the 90's.  And there are plenty more examples.  In neither case did they experience anything resembling an end of capitalism.  The resource problem is also a real thing, but resources have never been endless, and yet here we are with capitalism.

&gt;Are we entering an age like the 15th-18th centuries but except instead of hoarding gold, global powers strive to hoard key resources like water, food, various energy sources, semiconductors, and lithium to prevent the deindustrialization of their societies?

I would say no, because we never left it.  What we call ""globalization"" now is really just an expression of the fact that since WWII, the US was the dominant military power, so opening trade to the whole world was the best way to have an available supply of all resources needed.  But even so, there were always trade barriers between the US and the Soviet Union and its allies, as would be expected for great power competition.

&gt;Any way you count it, the figures are stark: Ukrainian casualties are running at a rate of somewhere between 6oo and 1,000 a day. One presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, told the Guardian this week it was 150 killed and 800 wounded daily; another, Mykhaylo Podolyak, told the BBC that 100 to 200 Ukrainian troops a day were being killed.

&gt;The sheer number – more than 20,000 casualties a month – raises questions about what state Ukraine’s army will be in if the war drags on into the autumn. The same is true for the Russians too, of course. But the invaders already control large chunks of Ukraine, and they can pause the fighting with the territorial upper hand.

&gt;Western officials prefer not to discuss the impact of the war on the defenders, instead highlighting the problems for the Russians in their briefings. This week, one of those officials said their estimate was that the invaders had lost “15,000 to 20,000 dead”, out of an invasion force that was 150,000 or more. Yet despite this, Moscow’s army has still not lost its offensive capability.

&gt;But they chose not to provide similar estimates for Ukraine, which can create a lopsided impression that the Russians are faring worse. In fact, with an artillery overmatch of 10 or 15 to one, according to the Ukrainians, it may well be that the invaders’ casualty rate is far lower at the moment, because they are able to deal death from a greater distance to defenders who cannot see them.

&gt;Ammunition is certainly running short on the Ukrainian side, again by their own admission. Vadym Skibitsky, the deputy head of Ukraine’s military intelligence, has said Ukraine is using 5,000 to 6,000 artillery rounds a day, and has “almost used up” its stockpile of Soviet 152mm standard shells. It is now relying on Nato-standard 155mm howitzers; it is unclear how many of these it has.

In what way does rearmament benefit Germany, though? It seems unlikely that Germany will get to use its new toys directly in the furtherance of any of its own goals; perhaps one could argue for a mechanism that will further increase its influence within Europe or the American imperial orbit (though of course always second to the core) as other more belligerent parties (either the US or the Baltics) will be offering it favours in return for support from its more meaningful military in their own campaigns. Maybe, in some roundabout form of pro-statist-economy argument, military spending is actually an unalloyed economical good, but it seems unlikely that military equipment would be the unique class of products a massive taxpayer-funded investment in which has that property.

As I see it, Europe continues being a loser in net, with the exception perhaps of Poland (which seems to have successfully overcome its near-pariah status in the process of this conflict).

[],False,,theoryofdoom,,,[],,,,text,t2_oop22,False,True,"&gt; Business leaders have declared the acceleration of deglobalization and sounded the alarm about a new period of stagflation.

What a strange sentence; almost as if to imply a policy by ""business leaders"" by decree.  Doesn't work that way.  Economic trends have merely followed in response to the conditions created by Joe Biden's policies influencing the landscape.  Supply chain vulnerability is the sole proximate cause of the combination of post-COVID 19 trends described as ""de-globalization,"" and that vulnerability is solely the result of the governmental response to COVID 19.  

Further, in view of the Biden administration's reckless spending (among other failures) throughout the pandemic on top of the other harms caused by the COVID 19 response, stagflation was inevitable.  If we're now operating from the perspective that the world isn't as flat as we previously thought it was (for those new to this subreddit, that's a reference to Tom Friedman's book, so titled), that's due solely to the policies of governments the world over. 

&gt; Academics have decried the return of conquest and hailed the renewal of transatlantic ties.

The academic commentary on these trends I've seen has been unsatisfying, almost without exception.  At least from the so called foreign policy establishment.  That being said, Marco Polo's world (again, another reference for those new to this subreddit) isn't fully back yet, either.  But we'll keep moving in that direction, to the extent the Biden administration's foreign policy approach continues to sunset the United States' role in global leadership.  

&gt; These dramatic shifts have overshadowed another profound transformation in the global energy system.  For the last two decades, the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions has gradually reshaped the global energy order.  Now, as a result of the war in Ukraine, energy security has returned to the fore, joining climate change as a top concern for policymakers.

I agree that Vladimir Putin's aggression against Ukraine has profoundly disrupted energy markets.  But reference to the concept of ""energy security"" is curious.  Continental Europe's reliance on Russian natural gas and petrochemical resources more generally is a known vulnerability, as it has been since the existence of the Soviet Union.  This isn't new.  Control over European energy markets has been an issue for more than the last two decades as an issue of geopolitical significance, and it has only been brought to forefront due to the game-changing reserves discovered by Exxon (and others) around 2013 in the Black Sea.  

Russia's control of the natural gas supply to Europe and more broadley continuing influence over energy markets in general depends on the structure of the competitive landscape.  This influence is the key source of Russia's ability to influence politics on the European continent.  To illustrate, if non-Russian suppliers develop the capacity to supply the European continent, new supply alternatives exist to displace the functional monopoly currently held by Russian oil and gas companies.  Examples abound, but the most significant manifestation of this relationship is in Germany's historical reluctance to hold Vladimir Putin to account in view of the risk that Russia might turn off the gas.  

It turns out there are tremendous natural gas reserves in the Black Sea, including within Ukraine's EEZ (even more so before Crimea was lost).  Ukraine, obviously, had no incentive whatsoever to cooperate with Russia on developing those fields which previously were not.  Ukraine was moving in that direction and negotiating/partnering with certain non-Russian companies for those purposes.  

Essentially, Ukraine very well could have been --- and probably still will be --- the alternative supplier to displace Russia in at least the Russian natural gas space. This is a game changer, across the board.  Though it's probably obvious, here's an illustration: if Germany (and others) no longer have to depend on Russia, then Russia no longer has the ability to threaten to shut off the gas, to extract political concessions on the continent or otherwise influence European foreign policy.  That mean's Ukraine's strategic value is completely redefined, as well.  Before those Black Sea reserves were known, Ukraine had no pathway to NATO membership.  Now, Ukraine's pathway to NATO membership is obvious.

Somewhat relatedly, much confusion surrounds discussion of Ukraine's potential NATO membership.  Certain purported academics (such as John Mearsheimer) claim, as they have for years on end, that vague and ambiguous agreements were informally reached between the United States and Russian Federation, in the couple of years immediately after the USSR's implosion.  

Those individuals argue effect of ""Ukraine's membership in NATO represents continuity of a encircling trend, at the expense of Russia's 'sphere of influence',"" or so the story goes.  This argument is incoherent, because if those were the goals, then Ukraine would already be a NATO member and the subject would have been settled when Russia was far weaker, during Yeltsin's rule.  Further, if encirclement was the goal, then the Budapest Memorandum wouldn't have likely even been papered.  Rather, Ukraine would have just ascended to become a NATO member, which is what it wanted all along and has wanted since the moment it became independent from the USSR.  

Except that is not what happened at all.  Rather, Washington's concern was nuclear nonproliferation --- a potentially catastrophic risk to global security, given the USSR's operational incompetence with respect to security over its supply of nuclear arms and technology.  Then, Ukraine's concern was that if they gave up what they had, left over from the USSR, Russia would treat Ukraine as a vassal state or worse absent NATO membership.  Now, and over the last decade or so, that risk has been reduced from theory to practice as Vladimir Putin has repeatedly violated Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.  

&gt; Together, these dual priorities are poised to reshape national energy planning, energy trade flows, and the broader global economy. 

This kind of language is difficult to take seriously.  So called ""green"" advocates express no interest in nuclear power, the sole technology that has the ability to meet current or future needs (and by implication, the sole technology that has the ability to replace coal-generated electricity).  Yet, these self-styled ""green"" advocates oppose nuclear power's expansion almost without exception.  

Though I assume most who are familiar with this subreddit are already aware, Germany's inexplicable aversion to nuclear power is the reason why it is beholden to Russia.  To sustain demands on Germany's electrical grid, it has to burn natural gas.  Natural gas Germany burns for this purpose comes from Russia.  As a point of comparison, France's electrical grid is not so encumbered, because France has (for now, at least) an outstanding nuclear utilization rate.  But that said, I agree energy planning is critical.  Germany lacks the infrastructure to import LNG because it does not have the facilities to convert.  Most of the existing infrastructure comprises Soviet-legacy pipelines over land, across the continent.  

Germany either has to import LNG to meet its needs, which it lacks the ability to do at this time, or come up with some other alternative.  And if Germany is going to take this seriously, it will not put its eggs all in the same basket.  Solar and wind have their place, but no one familiar with the technology rationally believes they can replace coal.  Nuclear is the only option for sustained grid demand, and Germany should have started moving in that direction 30 years ago and stayed on course.  Natural gas will continue to play a role in Germany's electrical demands for the foreseeable future, so to the extent grid demands can't be met with whatever else Germany is doing (whether solar, wind or anything else), it should be developing the infrastructure to import LNG.  
 
Europe needs to follow France's model (except to the extent that anti-nuclear voices seem to inexplicably be gaining ground there), in any case.  Electricity generation by coal is no longer a viable means and must be replaced, for reasons that should be obvious.  Coal can only be replaced by nuclear, but nuclear can't meet fluctuating grid demand.  Other options have to be available to supplement, and natural gas is the least worst means to that end at this time.  Likewise, so called green advocates need to understand the technologies they advocate for.  The useful life of wind turbines is a lot less than people realize and their carbon footprint is woefully undervalued.  Same with solar.  And both suffer the same reliability problems, because it turns out that acute increases in grid demand don't reliably correlate with the weather.  Sometimes that is true, but it has to always be true for those technologies to be viable in the absence of storage capacity.",da49a96a3384e04f0f094ea459de3b07653c57a9,True,False,,,,,0,1654953716,,0,{},ibyz4d5,False,t3_v6xh36,False,True,t3_v6xh36,/r/geopolitics/comments/v6xh36/the_new_energy_order_how_governments_will/ibyz4d5/,1654953734,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1654924916.0

It's likely that Ukraine will be able to take back some of the areas it has lost like Kherson.  It's also in Europe's interest to continue providing the flow of weapons to Ukraine so it can conduct counter offenses because having a third-world failed state on Europe's borders would destabilize the continent, especially in terms of refugees and political instability.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;USSR style collapse of Russia - possible in the medium to long-term but seems unlikely in the short term. 

Putin is likely very ill.  There may be chaos in Russia in a few years.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Popular revolt / uprising and insurgency in the occupied territories. This is unlikely now since the areas Russia is targeting have the highest percentage of Russian speakers and sympathizers.

Just because someone is a Russian speaker doesn't mean that they are pro-Russian.  There is a whole body of academic research about Russian-speaking Ukrainian patriots and the ""Zelensky effect.""  These guys aren't just going to go along as submissive slaves.  You are already seeing partisan activity in these areas and that is likely to increase if it goes to a years-long occupation.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;will get even less likely as time goes on (in myy opinion) because Russia is in the process of building civil institutions back up in these areas. They are being issued Russian passports, the currency is changing to roubles, pensions are still being paid, TV is being switched over to Russian broadcasting etc

Russia has no desire to ""rebuild civil society"" in its slave territories.  Any provinces under Russian control will be very poor like the Donbas region.  Putin isn't rebuilding Mariupol for instance.  This will lead to a massive exodus from that region as happened in the 2014/ 2015 war.  What'll likely happen as the occupation shifts is there will be massive migration out of the occupied regions and also saboteurs, etc. slipping in.  Russia cannot keep the borders closed and hundreds of thousands of people enslaved in prison states for years.  Those borders are too porous.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So far they haven't made the mistake the Americans made in Iraq by conquering the area but then dismissing all of the civil servants and people who can actually run the place.

They are going to keep thousands of soldiers in Mariupol and Kherson permanently to occupy those territories?

a) Militarily pushing Russia out of occupied areas - highly unlikely unless there is a ground and air assault by an allied coalition. Western allied countries have been very consistent that this is not on the cards anytime soon. 

b) USSR style collapse of Russia - possible in the medium to long-term but seems unlikely in the short term. Even if Europe is turning their backs on Russia there's other countries who aren't. Even the Europeans have proven themselves unable to fully let go of Russian oil let alone gas. 

c) Popular revolt / uprising and insurgency in the occupied territories. This is unlikely now since the areas Russia is targeting have the highest percentage of Russian speakers and sympathizers. 

Point c)will get even less likely as time goes on (in myy opinion) because Russia is in the process of building civil institutions back up in these areas. They are being issued Russian passports, the currency is changing to roubles, pensions are still being paid, TV is being switched over to Russian broadcasting etc. So far they haven't made the mistake the Americans made in Iraq by conquering the area but then dismissing all of the civil servants and people who can actually run the place.

Demographics, his analysis appears solid and data driven although it feels like he tends to accelerate things a bit too much. He also tends towards ""grand"" conclusions which gives a pretty good punchline but perhaps assumes that certain governments are a bit too powerless and the effects a bit too extreme.

Energy, don't know much. 

Electronics supply chain, I know a bit more about. Don't see it, as far as trends go. There might be some kind of re-shoring and deglobalization as he calls it but feel that he's a bit off on the scale and scope. There are moves out of China but it is going towards Vietnam/SEA and not at the pace that he claims. It would take a lot more investment and a lot more time for the shift to occur and my sense is that Vietnam/South East Asia cannot absorb a big portion of the capacity already installed in China. I've been away for a few years but my impression of Mexico isn't positive in terms of their technical ability or labor availability.

For a deeper look into China (where I think Peter is too superficial) there are some interviews with Michael Pettis (Prof of Finance in Beijing University) who gives a more nuanced breakdown (economics)

In terms of the US, Peter doesn't give enough weight to US politics and policy inertia.

* China: Russia is now much more dependent on Chinese good will than before, making them a prime economic client. The impending collapse of the CTSO as an organization will also allow China to expand its influence in the former-SSRs of Central Asia. 

* US: Russian aggression has reunited the developed world around the US and restored some of the prestige and trust it lost under Trump. The US also stands to benefit from energy exports to the EU. Developing countries may also look to the US in the future if they believe democratizing will help garner security relationships.

* The EU: This speaks not to any country in the EU, but rather, the EU as a political project. Euroskepticism has rapidly evaporated in the wake of Brexit and now Russian imperialism. Furthermore the sudden need for urgency in action in the EU is promoting greater integration and reform to the decision making processes.

* Turkey: Turkey's relationship with the EU and US has been tense, and its economic situation is exceptionally dire. Playing the role as 'mediator' of the conflict allows them to benefit, especially from Russian energy exports. Their control of the Bosphorous is also a card they can once more flex on the world stage, all but guaranteeing others must court them. They may also extract some US concessions in return for allowing Sweden and Finland into NATO.

* Japan: While a country not well thought of, the growing threat of Russia may prove the last straw needed for Japan to finally make constitutional changes allowing it to formally emerge as a military power in the west pacific. It is also possible for them to use the war either as a way to negotiate the return of territory from Russia with economic concessions, or seize them outright with Russia unable to militarily respond

* Venezuela: With the sanctions against Russia, the US can no longer afford to shut Venezuela out of the market. A thawing of relations appears to be imminent, and they stand ready to benefit from increased access to global trade.

Losers:

* Germany: Germany's international reputation lies somewhat in ruins after such a large foreign policy failure courting Russia. Ordinary Germans also stand to suffer for their leader's willingness to become dependent on Russian gas. It's nominal status as an EU leader is for now in question.

* Armenia: The breakdown of Russia as a military power has left Armenia without strong allies to protect it. Armenia now only has Iran to really look to for support, which is not good for them. They face the probability of total loss of control of their eastern territory. Ethnic tensions are likely to flare up further.

* Syria: Like Armenia, Syria has heavily depended on Russian military support. A Russian withdrawal from the region seems increasingly more likely, which could further embolden Turkey and Syrian opposition groups. The civil war in general seems set to continue even longer as a shifting balance of power could reignite fighting.

* Africa/South Asia: The financial shock of the conflict combined with rising food prices are set to send many countries into famine and civil strife. There's too many to really list.

[],False,,BlueNoobster,,,[],,,,text,t2_24x8g1ac,False,False,"&gt;The US and EU fought the Cold War against Russia without Russia gas so now we result back to the old way nothing change really

That actually isnt true. The EU bought most of its gas from the soviet Union since the energy crisis in the 1970 after the Iran coup and the US backed Shar of Iran getting overthrown by his fed up people. Since then gas and oil come to a significant part from the soviet union/russia. Germany literally had part of their strategy until today, ""change through trade"" attributed to this trade with the soviets that is partly credited for the (more or less) peaceful end of the soviet union and the (more or less) peaceful retreat of soviet troops frome astern europe.

One argument for the gas trade with russia to continue was literally that even at the hight of the cold war in the 1980s the soviet union never violated any of its delivery treaties with western european countries (while nukes faced each other and the arms race went overdrive the gas and oincreasingly oil kept flowwing from east to west).

And the ""old ways"" for oil arent exactly possible eather because the US kind of blew up the middle east, europes primary fossile ressource supplier, post 9/11. Iraq? Instable and not a reliable trading partner. Iran? Embargoed and Trump destroyed the europeans attempt at a deal with it (years of work destroyed in a single day) Venezualea? Embargoed. Lybia? blown up by the USA and France, the list goes on...

At to that the obvious problem of gas and oil demand having increased several times over compared to the middle of the cold war and europes oil and gas producers like Norway, UK and Neatherlands can no longer cover russias share at all.

""The EU don’t have to buy oil and gas from Russia, Russia is just more convenient for them.""

Literally not true. Europes gas producers without Russia can basically only supply 50%-60% of demand and the entire global LNG market (which is mainly in long term trade deals going to asia that wont change anytime soon anyway) isnt enough to cover the remaining 40% share alone. You seriously underestimate the ammount of gas of the EU and how gas infrastructure works. And regarding Oil I just pointed out several reasons why it isnt exactly that easy to find long term trade partners ouside of europe anymore that arent morally evil ont he asme level as russia, instable, US embargoed or literally one bad election away from fuckiing europe over.",50cc006454f47dd192106b54f9a65d666ac08357,True,False,,,,,0,1654906203,,0,{},ibx36dg,False,t3_v9ekxq,False,True,t1_ibwy0mh,/r/geopolitics/comments/v9ekxq/which_countries_do_you_think_have_been_the_main/ibx36dg/,1654906218,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1654877403.0
