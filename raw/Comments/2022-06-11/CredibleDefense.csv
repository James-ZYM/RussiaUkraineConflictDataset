Before adjustment, no, it's not - which is the point.

&gt;There's a whole bunch of questions why Ukraine is talking about these self-reported average losses; it's reasonable to believe them, with a side-note that they're saying these numbers to western media in the context of asking for more help.

Indeed, they are asking for more help - and part of the reason why seems to be that attrition isn't favorable to them.

&gt;Taking 150 for 3 week average seems like a higher end number to me personally.

Why? For the first phase of the conflict (February 24 - April 19), U.S. intelligence arrives at a range of 100 - 200 Ukrainian daily KIA... Which averages out at 150. Podolyak himself gives a current range of 100 - 200 daily KIA, again averaging out at 150. If anything, given that the current phase is by all accounts bloodier than the first for Ukraine, the estimate of 150 KIA could be thought of as being conservative.

&gt;On Russian side we really have no clue. We know that Ukrainians provide higher-end estimates.

We do have various clues. You're even mentioning one: UAF estimates, by their very nature, are likely overcounts... And if one takes them at face value (one shouldn't), they still show a 1:1 KIA ratio for the last 3 weeks, and a favorable ratio for the Russians last week.

That is, if they actually are an estimate of Russian-aligned KIA, and not a wider category (say, KIA + estimated DoW/disabled/PoW).

&gt;West doesn't know either, and we don't know how they estimate it.

Western estimates have been pretty consistent throughout the conflict. Given ELINT/SIGINT, there's no reason to assume they are worthless.

Ultimately, Western estimates arrive at 47% - 63% of UAF estimates, the latter which are (1) poorly defined and (2) overwhelmingly likely to be inflated.",6bf52e5efd83e19db42e69b26044e2bcf298ce45,True,False,,,,,0,1654988534,,0,{},ic0ycm6,False,t3_v9w3cj,False,True,t1_ic0pf9g,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v9w3cj/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_11_2022/ic0ycm6/,1654988550,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654959734.0

[],False,,MagicianNew3838,,,[],,,,text,t2_3rh4cbrh,False,False,"I'm not sure Ukraine even has that much of a manpower advantage.

With 1,000 combat casualties per day, in a single month 30,000 troops are out of commission. Consider that Ukraine's entire pre-war ground forces establishment - including naval infantry, airborne, SF, National Guard, higher HQ and various rear services, including training units, etc. - amounted to 212,600 men (IISS, 2022).

This means that Ukraine is losing, on a monthly basis, 1 / 7th of its total pre-war manpower, and this disproportionately occurring among combat arms. We know from Ukraine's MoD [White Book](https://www.mil.gov.ua/content/files/whitebook/WB_2019_2020_eng.pdf) that they had 228,800 ready reservists pre-war: 144,300 in the TDF and 84,500 in the reinforcement reserve. By April 8 over [110,000 TDF reservists](https://armyinform.com.ua/2022/04/08/do-lav-teroborony-vstupyly-110-tys-ukrayincziv-bilshe-100-vzhe-mayut-derzhavni-nagorody-brygadnyj-general-yurij-galushkin/) were already under arms, with the balance probably either (1) having been mobilized by now and/or (2) having fallen under enemy occupation early on in the Kherson / Zaporizhzhia Oblasts.

We lack data about the commitment of the reinforcement reserve, but presumably they have all been allocated by now, either to man reserve brigades (such as the 60th Mechanized) or as individual replacements.

Now, looking at casualties:

1. U.S. intelligence estimated on [April 19](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/19/world/ukraine-russia-donbas-offensive.html) that Ukraine had suffered up to that point 5,500 - 11,000 KIA and **more than** 18,000 WIA. Incidentally April 19 was also the very date when Russia launched its ""phase 2"" offensive to take the Donbas.
2. Per Russian MoD Shoigu, by [June 7](https://english.alarabiya.net/News/world/2022/06/07/Russia-fully-liberated-residential-areas-of-Sievierodonetsk-Defense-minister) Russian-aligned forces had captured 6,489 Ukrainian soldiers. Given the large number of PoW taken in the fall of Mariupol, this seems reasonable to me.
3. Assuming Ukrainian losses have been stable during Russia's ""phase 2"" offensive at a daily rate of 150 KIA + 800 WIA, Ukraine would have lost a further 8,000 KIA and 42,000 WIA over the last 7 and 1/2 weeks.

This would give a total of:

1. 13,500 - 19,000 KIA
2. **More than** 60,000 WIA, of which a non-trivial minority (15-30%?) will either (1) die from their wounds and (2) become permanently disabled
3. 6,500 PoW

Taking the WW2 average of 3 months for recovered wounded to be rehabilitated, the very first WIA of the conflict would just become available for redeployment to their units. Given somewhat lower UAF combat losses in the first phase of the conflict, as well as the share of DoW/disabled among wounded, the returnee inflow can perhaps cover half of Ukraine's current WIA outflow.

Summing up, we arrive at an estimate of **more than** 80,000 - 85,500 combat losses, which virtually matches - likely slightly exceeds - Ukraine's pre-war reinforcement reserve of 84,500 personnel. This suggests that Ukraine's ground component - after activation of the TDF - has expanded to slightly more than 300,000 personnel, again including higher HQ / rear / units undergoing R&amp;R / training establishments / etc.

To make good current losses, Ukraine would have to feed \~17,000 fresh recruits into the meat grinder every month, plus recovered wounded. I don't doubt that Ukraine can find the bodies - the figure isn't that large in the absolute - but is the UAF training cadre large enough to absorb that many conscripts effectively? And how effective will be their training, given the pressure to immediately provide available replacements?

There's been a lot of discussion about Russia's struggles to absorb and effectively train replacements given (1) the deployment of experienced personnel at the front and (2) the limited size of their training establishment / the fact that it largely occurs within deployable units themselves.

The thing is, I don't see how this also doesn't apply to Ukraine...

&gt;The naval report doesn't say what you think it does, and is actually very clear on the idea that dual authority does not mean equal authority. It describes the commissar's role in terms of the chaplain/senior enlisted of the ship.

To simply take the most glaring and obvious difference, neither the chaplain nor the senior enlisted member on a ship in any non-Chinese navy has the authority to evaluate the ship's captain and impact his career. 

More from the CSIS report about commissars:

""The PLAN’s current system promotes dual-command authority between the
political commissar and military commander to make administrative and
operational decisions. Division of responsibility exists, but those responsibilities
are inevitably linked to each other.
▪ In a dual-command structure (双首长制; shuang shouzhang zhi), the political
commissar is typically the same grade and in most situations the same rank.
▪ Both officers follow direction and guidance from superior PSCs.""

...

&gt;Operating under a system referred to as the “division of responsibility system under the
unified collective leadership of the Party committee (党委统一的集体领导下的首长分工
负责制; dangwei tongyi de jiti lingdao xia de shouzhang fengong fuzezhi),” perennial tension
exists between military commanders and PSCs over decisionmaking power.45 While the
military commander assumes responsibility in military work-related issues (军事工作方
面的问题; junshi gonzuo fangmian de wenti), they must work within the PSC’s collectively
designed goals.46 As the supreme decisionmaking organization in the unit, the PSC
commands work in military affairs, political work, logistics, and equipment supply and
maintenance. Officers, enlistees, and various organizations within the unit cannot act as
they please (各行其是; gexing qishi), position themselves as equals to the Party committee
(不能与党委并立; buneng yu dangwei bingli), or place themselves above the Party
committee (更不能凌驾与党委之上; geng buneng lingjia yu dangwei zhishang).47


""In fact,
experts from the PLA National Defense University have called on the Party committee to
become the “general’s tent (中军帐; zhongjun zhang)” where council of war is held.49 There is
evidence of temporary Party committees making tactical decisions on confronting suspected
pirate boats, rescuing fishermen on high seas, and whether a submarine should surface or
remain submerged when the seawater piping system malfunctioned.50 Nonetheless, when
faced with emergency situations (紧急情况下; jinji qingkuang xia), the military commander
can decide and issue orders independently.51 However, the military commander must
report back to the Party committee later regarding decisions made and submit to Party
committee inspection.52 In other words, the military commander is accountable to the
unit Party committee, and their power in decisionmaking waxes and wanes depending
on the situation. While the military commander largely retains the freedom to command,
that autonomy is nevertheless influenced by the existence of a superior decisionmaking
organization, which most definitely shapes a commander’s leadership and behavior.""

▪ The PSC is the nerve center of decisionmaking aboard a naval vessel.
▪ The PSC promotes a collective leadership model that covers both administrative
and operational issues.
▪ The PLAN’s collective leadership model in decisionmaking aboard naval vessels may
result in delayed response times in critical situations, a lack of flexibility to adapt
senior leaders’ contrasting viewpoints, and increased miscommunication.
▪ The PLAN’s collective leadership model emphasizes more control and is useful in
problem solving. This differs from the U.S. Navy’s mission command model, which
is based on flexibility and independence.
▪ A PSC can be comprised of five to six officers: a commanding officer, two executive
officers (operations and administrative/logistics), a political commissar, and one or
two deputy political commissars.
▪ The U.S. Navy utilizes a command triad structure involving two officers and one top
senior enlisted officer or top non-commissioned officer. This typically includes a
commanding officer, an executive officer, and a command master chief or chief of
the boat (submarines).""",11e6ad1510096b908969880bda69c320893ced9b,True,False,,,,,0,1654986694,,0,{},ic0usis,False,t3_v9sq6j,False,False,t1_ic0thb9,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v9sq6j/officer_and_enlisted_quality_comparison_in_the_us/ic0usis/,1654986709,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654957894.0

&gt; This lack of wartime training experience is essential because it is almost impossible to simulate warfare and gain that knowledge until someone engages in war.

You dispatch observers, do joint exercises and conferences with countries that have fought in war (well known are the Sino-Russian drills, less well known is that China did joint training with UK and US during the GWOT), and use spies.

&gt; The PLA has resorted to attempting to gain some war experience and reduce this gap by reading books on war. [5]

Source [5] actually says: ""The Shenyang Military Region attaches great importance to the issue of actual combat training, and actively innovates and develops actual combat training practices, which has played an important role in improving the actual combat capability of the troops""

&gt; However, the PLA, with their previously mentioned lack of warfare since 1979, can tend to fall into “peace disease,” where the SMs may believe they will always be in a peacetime environment. This mindset can lead to complacency during training exercises and a reduced level of effort. 

There's no lack of effort in Chinese exercises. They have an entirely different problem. PLA is obsessed with force on force, and, outside the field, competitive simulation. Officers are promoted or fired based on their relative performance. Cheating is prolific in these exercises, and the CMC-level OpFor especially is notorious for using a host of bullshit tactics like tactical nukes in limited war scenarios and pretending to be party officials inspecting the exercise to take the Redfor commander hostage. It's basically Millennium Challenge on a national scale.

&gt; The PLA struggles with training their leadership in the concept of mission command. Mission command is when a commander gives the guidance and intent to subordinates for them to make decisions without constant communications.9 The U.S. military uses mission command throughout all levels on an almost daily basis. Commanders are required to give the end state, and it is up to the subordinate to develop the plan of action to meet that end state. By frequently using mission command in a garrison environment, the U.S. SMs are trained better for war. 

Like many articles this one exists in the alternate universe where the PLA is a Russian-style force - this perception was created in the Cold War when there was an almost total lack of access to the PLA by Western scholars and officers, so a perception was created that they were ""Soviet-inspired"". In reality the PLA, being originally guerrillas and having only ever had German and Japanese influences, are probably the most decentralized force in the world. So much so that training is decided at the brigade level and there is not even a unified doctrine - every military region has its own SOP and special forces. The US army, meanwhile, despite making a big deal of mission command after WW2, is [not a good example of a mission command force](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/us-army-culture-french), and in modern combined arms warfare this is a good thing.

&gt; The PLA has a “traditional” military commander present for operational issues and has a political officer present for political matters at the company level and above. These two individuals share equal say in what occurs within the unit, and neither can make a unilateral decision

The political officer's actual title is ""instructor"" and mostly exists to boost unit morale and politically indoctrinate enlisted. He rarely exercises any command responsibility, especially today where the commissariat has been reduced to an HR department.

&gt; Additionally, if they violate this and fail to consult with each other on all decisions, they may be reported to the party committee where the decision would be subject to review.

This is basically a meaningless sentence. Guess who chairs the unit party committee? The unit CO and political officer.

&gt; With this sort of system in place, the military commander is unable to exercise any initiative,  significantly degrading the leadership abilities of the officers in the PLA. 

I don't know how anyone even vaguely familiar with the PLA's combat history can conclude that its junior officers are ""unable to exercise any initiative"".

&gt; However, in the PLA, there is a lack of emphasis on the centrality of training.19 They do not currently have centralized locations where everyone receives this standardized training to ensure that all SMs train to the same standard. Instead, the PLA would rely on the local unit, mostly at the brigade level, to conduct training for SMs.

*Basic training* is done at centralized locations, as are specialist, officer, and NCO courses. Year round training is decided at the brigade level, but all brigades rotate through 6 CTCs annually, and do regular force on force exercises and wargames against each other. There is no emphasis on centrality because of the competitive aspect - brigade COs are allowed to innovate to beat their peers, but ultimately everyone just copies the winners.

&gt; In the PLA, SMs spend 40% of their time in basic training on political activity.

""Political activity"" more specifically means reading the military writings of Mao Zedong and studying the campaigns of the PLA, which isn't a great use of time in boot camp, but it's far from non-military. It's more like reading a modernized, dumbed down Clausewitz.

&gt; The higher quality PLA conscripts are likely to exit upon completing their obligation period, leaving the remaining SMs as lower quality members.

[There has never been conscription in the PRC](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/jul/31/do-chinas-new-draft-rules-set-up-a-possible-war/). 

&gt;   Another demoralizing aspect in the PLA is how they do not use Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) as leaders, as the U.S. military does. For example, the PLA tends to use NCOs as technical specialists, and they do not seem to be moving away from that tendency.27  This treatment is demoralizing to these NCOs because they chose to stay beyond the conscription period through passing difficult exams and requirements, and are they are still viewed as technical personnel.

Well first it's not ""demoralizing"" because NCOs are expected to transition to officer in the PLA, and there are and have always been squad leaders.

&gt;Regarding Girkin, he is a FSB Lt. Colonel. Yes, he is not enlisted, he is not active, he’s in reserves, that’s a different question, but he undoubtedly goes to Lubyanka (FSB main headquarters in Moscow) to his direct curators – every agent, whether former or active has a responsible person they are connected to. Of course, he can say things… but he can only be scolded after the fact, he understands what he’s dealing with so he’ll never cross the red line. Everything he says in one way or another is valuable and needed for someone inside the security service, inside the FSB.  
&gt;  
&gt;Even when he attacks Putin, and he appears to be an anti-Putinist, which he is pretending to be in my view, it is still needed for insider operative goals and objectives… For some time he was pulling in certain audience which he then snitched on – they were creating the 25 January committee \*of ultranationalists\*. It is entirely possible that some things he says come from his heart and that he says all the alarmist speeches based on his own opinions, but again if it crossed what’s allowed he would have already stopped this whole public activity.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Look, in reality, he \*Girkin\* is a “repeater” – there is such a term in the security services, it’s a person who doesn’t speak their own mind, or their thoughts coincide with what they’re offered to voice. Thus, he is practically voicing certain things that are used to release steam for a specific category of Russian citizens. These citizens belong to ultra radical structures with imperial ambitions “…” Girkin did not join FSB immediately, he fought in Transnistria, Balkan Wars, that’s where he was noticed by the FSB and recruited in 1994-95. As an ex secret service operative he got into the system where… there’s a category of secret servicemen who realistically assess the situation and certainly do not support the moves which are currently being undertaken by the authorities.  
&gt;  
&gt;“..” These are definitely not lovers of Ukraine… but they say the army is not ready and there will be serious consequences for the army and Russia. This category of people are now trying to play these contradictions and through Girkin all these things are being voiced. That’s one thing. Another thing is that in any situation they can say – if you say we have no alternative opinions, here it is – we have Girkin who can let himself say the things that are completely unacceptable.

Note that in contrast there have been relatively fewer sanctions on medical supplies, because (1) the norms against restricting medical supplies are stronger than the norms against restricting parts for stolen planes, (2) the consequence of no medical supplies is more likely to be death compared to the consequence of lack of plant parts, which is more likely to be grounded planes, and (3) the economic pain from less air travel is greater than the economic pain from fewer medical supplies.

But the only options available in response to military aggression like we are seeing are military, sanctions, and doing nothing.

Military responses result in the most deaths, and thousands of Russians are dying because of our military support for Ukraine. Mostly people who joined the military because they were poor and leaked better opportunities in life.

Sanctions result in Russian deaths, but less of them.

No action results in Ukrainian deaths, and even acknowledging that Russian civilians and soldiers have little control over their government, Ukrainians have less complicity in the current war than Russians, so I prefer resolving the conflict through ways that produce Russian deaths than though ways that produce Ukrainian deaths.

So that leaves us with responding through ways that produce more Russian soldier deaths or fewer Russian civilian deaths. I don't really prefer one over the other. I mean on a 1 to 1 basis I'd prefer soldier deaths over civilian deaths, but since the soldier deaths are greater, and I think soldier deaths are still bad, it's kind of a wash morally speaking.

&gt;""June 11 (Reuters) - The price of U.S. gasoline averaged more than $5 a gallon for the first time on Saturday, data from the AAA showed, extending a surge in fuel costs that is driving rising inflation.  
The national average price for regular unleaded gas rose to $5.004 a gallon on June 11 from $4.986 a day earlier, AAA data showed.  
High gasoline prices are a headache for President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats as they struggle to maintain their slim control of Congress with midterm elections coming up in November.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Biden has pulled on numerous levers to try to lower prices, including a record release of barrels from U.S. strategic reserves, waivers on rules for producing summer gasoline, and leaning on major OPEC countries to boost output.**  
  
**Yet fuel prices have been surging around the world due to a combination of rebounding demand, sanctions on oil producer Russia after its invasion of Ukraine and a squeeze on refining capacity.**""

Abstract:

Scholars investigating the sources of military capability have located sources of effectiveness in the structure of the international system, the characteristics of states, and features of the armed forces engaged in battle. They also point toward the likely influence of individual-level variables, but such claims tend to lack theoretical and empirical justification. We advance the literature by investigating whether individual initiative—that is, actions taken by soldiers and junior officers to achieve their commander's intent while in the absence of orders, when existing orders no longer fit the situation, or when unforeseen opportunities or threats arise—systematically conditions armed forces’ performance on the battlefield. We develop a theory connecting individual initiative with military effectiveness, highlighting the role of “problem-solving” in facilitating the use of men and materiel in battle. We then assess the empirical validity of our claim through an examination of a uniquely informative episode in military history: Israel's fight on the Sinai front during the first three days of the 1973 Yom Kippur War. The case allows us to hold constant a wide range of potentially confounding variables and, to the best of our knowledge, conduct the first systematic investigation of the impact of individual initiative on the performance of units engaged in combat actions. Our findings suggest individual initiative does have systematic effects on armed forces’ effectiveness in combat. Implications and directions for future research on the development and use of military capabilities are briefly considered.

—————————

&gt; * Do individuals play a regular, detectable role in mak- ing militaries more or less effective in combat? More specifically, what, if any, systematic effect do soldiers and junior officers employing individual initiative—that is, acting to achieve their commander’s intent while in the absence of orders, when existing orders no longer fit the situation, or when unforeseen opportunities or threats arise—have on the creation of fighting power in battle? 

&gt; * We seek to fill this gap in the literature by investigat- ing the relationship between the exercise of individual initiative and military effectiveness. 

&gt; * The pervasiveness of uncertainty in war is what renders the exercise of individual initiative so potentially significant in the creation of fighting power. 

&gt; * Initiative, thus understood, concerns problem-solving and involves the creative use of stock tactics, techniques, and procedures to overcome unique battlefield chal- lenges that, due to the vagaries of combat, differ from those anticipated by doctrinal publications, pre-combat training, or commanders’ orders 

&gt; * …we contend that militaries in which frontline forces reg- ularly practice problem-solving in the manner described should tend to perform better on the battlefield than those that do not. 

&gt; * …initiative is only likely to be frequently employed in particular types of military organizations. Specifically, junior officers and enlisted soldiers are unlikely to employ initiative—and certainly not on a regular basis—unless (1) the larger military organization of which they are a part encourages—or at least does not punish—such independent action and (2) forces are sufficiently well trained that they can identify situations in which initiative may be called for and act accordingly.10 When serving as part of such military organizations, junior officers and enlisted soldiers will be more likely to both possess the confidence to make decisions to act independently and choose tactically advantageous courses of action. 

&gt; * Second, initiative, especially when employed under the conditions described in the preceding paragraph, is likely to have generally positive direct and indirect effects on battlefield dynamics. In particular, soldiers and junior officers employing initiative are likely to facilitate efficient and effective use of manpower and materiel in local tactical actions. 

&gt; * Finally, soldiers’ and junior officers’ use of initiative can condition the generation of martial strength by permitting adoption of particularly powerful forms of force employment. Scholars have shown that militaries using maneuver strategies are generally more capable of defeating their adversaries than those reliant on at- trition strategies (Mearsheimer 1983; Stam 1996). 

&gt; * Absent individual initiative, unanticipated obstacles will slow or even stall the rapid advances and penetrations of enemy lines upon which such strategies depend. Similarly, others have shown that militaries using the “modern system” of force employment at the operational and tactical levels of warfighting also tend to be more capable of defeating their adversaries than those that do not (Biddle 2004; Grauer and Horowitz 2012). 

&gt; * Third, the case allows a remarkable number of potentially confounding variables to be held constant. Israel’s regime type, civil–military relationship, social structure and culture, warfighting doctrine, and soldier quality did not change in any meaningful way during the three days of fighting. Additionally, the Egyptian attack across the Suez Canal—Operation Badr—was heavily scripted, thoroughly practiced, and launched with near- uniform effort and tactics across the entirety of the front, ensuring that Israeli forces throughout the Sinai faced foes of similar training and operational capability carry- ing out essentially the same offensive actions 

&gt; * Against the invading Egyptian force of approximately 200,000 men, Israel fielded two infantry and three armor brigades— roughly 18,000 men, of whom only 8,000 were in position to fight in the opening hours of the conflict 

&gt; * While in most armies every aspect of recruits’ lives is tightly controlled, Israeli inductees were permit- ted relative freedom—in their appearance and use of time off, for example—as long as they performed essential tasks at the times and in the manner required 

&gt; * This policy created among the trainees a gen- eralized sense of freedom tempered with responsibility that was supplemented with specific courses “aimed at testing and increasing personal judgment and initiative” 

&gt; * Turning first to the infantry units in the fortifications, the sixteen installations in operation in 1973 were held by approximately 500 officers and men of the Jerusalem Brigade (Sakal 2014, 467–68). The brigade—comprised of reservists including men in their late thirties, recent im- migrants, and a few younger veterans of combat units— had never served on the Bar Lev Line and was only sta- tioned there to allow the regulars to spend Yom Kippur with their families…

&gt; * …the Israelis killed only 208 Egyptians during the crossing—far fewer than the 20,000–30,000 casualties Egyptian planners assumed would be incurred 

&gt; * The reasons for the failure of Israel’s counterattack are myriad and include insufficient intelligence on Egyp- tian deployments, little effective air support, and poor communications—technical and substantive—between headquarters and frontline forces (Cordesman and Wagner 1990, 50; Rabinovich 2004, 236–43; Herzog 2005, 249; Sakal 2014, 208–87). Particularly striking, however, was the absence of initiative, especially in Adan’s division. The attacking armored units failed to learn from the experience of Mendler’s forces and, adhering to both the letter of their orders and pre-war doctrinal precepts, tended to charge recklessly into Egyp- tian defenses, mounting “what looked like old-fashioned cavalry charges, without infantry support and with inadequate artillery support” (Herzog 2005, 254). 

&gt; * We have taken the first steps toward filling this gap in scholarly understanding by developing a model premised on the inherently uncertain nature of warfighting that affords independent and causal significance to junior officers’ and enlisted soldiers’ use of initiative—actions they take to achieve their commander’s intent while in the absence of orders, when existing orders no longer fit the situation, or when unforeseen opportunities or threats arise. 

&gt; * In particular, we found instances of in- creased military effectiveness most often among the units holding the fortifications along the Bar Lev Line, where initiative was used most frequently, least often during the 8 October counterattack when initiative was rarely used, and occasionally among the armored units charged with the initial defense of Israeli positions along the Suez Canal where initiative was sporadically undertaken.

Possible secondary explanations:

The person sending forces into Popasna and the one sending forces into SD aren't talking to one another, but this feels bogus - Russians play musical chairs with units along the front a lot, a lot of the more mobile and experienced units have jumped between cities a whole bunch, someone's coordinating that.

Let me preface this by saying that I generally agree with your premise. The Ukrainians have claimed though, repeatedly and through out  this war, that their infantry is considerably superior to the Russians. And their point in Severodonetskis is to maximize this advantage using their higher vantage point and better tactical cross fire positions. There was also an OSINT post on Twitter early on in the counterattack that the two units of the FL was being led by former SEALs and there are a ton of former SF in the foreigners in that front line. And, it would be a fair conclusion that these guys would be heads and shoulders above any close combat troops the Russians can put in to take the entire city. 

The cadence I’ve also observed is that, it seems every 12 hours, we hear that the Russians are pulling back to the east of the city to let their artillery work on the industrial zone, followed by fierce street to street fire fights back in the west and repeat. If the Ukrainians can see this movement from the cliff in Lysychansk and bunker down, retreat and take cover before the artillery shelling starts, then they could potentially do this for quite some time. I think what they’re claiming, though, is that that’s all they can do because they don’t have the artillery firepower to push the Russians back further, and that the Russians have an overwhelming manpower advantage. Now, is that worth it? Should you be losing some of your best SF men in a firefight in a city that you *know* you’re eventually going to lose? I’d agree that it doesn’t to **us**.

I think the whole thing can be summed up by putins deniability not even being for his sake. It’s because he was smart enough to calculate if he denies it, **it’s putin giving the western politicians an off ramp to not have to do anything when they had so much financial interest and dependencies**.

Think about after crimea, for almost a decade nothing was done about the dependencies on Russian gas.

Merkel and her lot even denied that putin was weaponising gas just so they could still push ahead with nordstream 2.

Politicians just really wanted the status quo and saying that they so greatly feared escalation was just something they could tell the pesky citizens to explain why they aren’t helping Ukraine.

That’s what I’ve come to believe.

Simply put, we knew for years that Russian regular troops were in Ukraine and they took part in ensuring the encirclements of the Ukrainians at debaltseve and ilovaisk.

Nothing was done. There wasn’t a huge screaming and woooing “we have clear proof russia is invading Ukraine”.

Putin always denying it was almost like a gentleman’s agreement. “I won’t be too brazen and give you an excuse to have to do more and you let me do what I’m doing”.

I seriously think if there was no issues with gas dependencies and the like and corruption and likely worries for the coming winter there would never have been any talk about “sending heavy weapons could cause escalation”.

It’s part of the rot of our political class, they could never admit a mistake and swallow it in National interest and realise they made such a grave error they endangered the security of the country.

Instead it’s “ well we already made the mistake of becoming dependent so we are going to continue with that as we have no choice, let me emphasise that as gas is being weaponised sure we’d already not supply heavy weapons for fear of being cutoff but were going to say it’s us making the smart decision as we think putin will launch nukes if we send some heavy artillery”

I truly think scholz is either trying to wait it out for a ceasefire or he’s hoping to keep the single digit artillery systems on hold until winter then arrange not to send them in order to secure gas or expect that ii can be a reason not to send them.

We simply wouldn’t have made all these decisions if ee had better leaders.. we had almost ten years!

Most of what's being said in the article is believable, but I'm initially dubious of this claim.  Russia's expending 2k+ metric tons of artillery ammunition per day, for an offensive that's been going on for a sustained period of time?  We've assumed that Russia's supply of basic dumb munitions is infinite for the purpose of conversation (though apparently for 122mm it isn't), but the amount they can fire at any second is more grounded.

&gt;The front line is remaining relatively static but this level of casualties is not sustainable.

I'm sure this will get reiterated a lot (I've already said this twice), but I'm legitimately concerned about Ukraine's strategy.  Prolonging Severodonetsk's siege is not worth these casualties, when they could instead invest these troops into the far more defensible Lyshiansk that Russia also needs to take.  This is literally the worst position on their frontline to try and do this on, why are they doing this here?  The town's tactical importance is low and political importance is far below ""1000 casualties a day"" levels.

Continuing with the current strategy of fighting tooth and nail for SD proper only makes sense if they legitimately think they can decisively shatter Russia's push exactly there, which seems like a big gamble.  And if they do think that, why wouldn't they wait to shatter that same push at Lyshiansk while suffering fewer casualties?  There's the argument of trying to rally morale by not ceding a big city to the Russians, but raising morale is going to be pretty hard to do when you're telling everyone about your 1000 casualties a day.

Zelensky getting hugely unpopular after could cause some huge political upheaval and what comes after him may not be very optimistic.

It could cause a lot of upheaval and a new leader could be very corrupt or be very weak and ineffectual which could then lay the ground work for a renewed invasion.

Just because you train Ukrainians on it doesn’t mean you have to send it in straight away.

Take the initiative.

Why not prepare and have trainee Ukrainians in the most accessible systems like that and also MLRS two months ago and then used that in reserve.

Rather than.. oh they’re getting their shit pushed in let’s get political capital by announcing we will send them something, have a back and forth then start training that will take ages and have them in field in small numbers far too late.

It’s just like scholz announcing the IRIS-T when only like two are made a year and they’d likely only get to Ukraine maybe by the end of the year. ( basically just playing to the fact a ceasefire may come in before that then it can be withdrawn based on ‘escalating tensions when Ukraine has just found peace’)

I really wish that we planned for even a year ahead, with the aim to help Ukraine push the Russians out.

We should have started covert training on things like Bradley’s, any hand me down tanks like older abrams or f-15s even so that in a years time we’re not having politicians saying “ we’re ready to give this but training will take a year.

Instead we have this self deterrence of “ well we can’t give them long range HIMARS in case that’s escalatory” meanwhile they already have tochka-u and didn’t strike deep into Russia.

When the same self deterrence was moronically applied weeks ago over giving heavy weapons or tanks.

We even have the same moronic attitude of counting lottery tickets and telling the Ukrainians to be responsible about wins we haven’t even yet facilitated.

Like “ omg we can’t embarrass Russia too much, what if the Ukrainians win too much and they get desperate”

Like let the Ukrainians lose more land to occupation and have more citizens raped and murdered because you seem scared what could happen if an invaded doesn’t get what they want.

It’s ridiculous. As we already tried the other way, they simply invaded and tore up Minsk the day before.

We had that where Ukraine wasn’t even allowed to buy heavy weapons that would stop them getting encircled for years.

In war that's probably 6-8 weeks.

MLRS and M109 being used in Ukraine is literally based on the Bradley chassis.

Ammo? How much ammo do you think a Bradley uses compared to artillery??? It's a 25mm autocannon. Not a spaceship.

One MLRS rocket barrage is 1.5 tons. A tow missile is like 12 pounds.

1500 TOWS for 10 tons. That's enough for 100 Bradleys. 1 hour of MLRS is = the the TOW ammo supply in weight.

&gt; I’m not trying to shit on the bravery of individual soldiers, and those who fight on in the NRF and have joined ISIS-K I’m sure are very motivated fighters, but the fact remains that the ANA was vastly superior in man power and material, and utterly collapsed in a very short period of time.

No Army survives treachery from within. Has never happened, won't ever happen.

&gt; Mostly they didn’t even have to win by brute force but via negotiated/paid surrenders/defections. Local warlords switched sides en mass when it because clear the Taliban could offer them a better deal. 

The local Warlords know that without American support they don't stand a chance against Pakistan and will be killed. America lost to Pakistan, when it elecet a President who as always been wrong in geopolitics (per Robert Gates). Plain and simple

&gt;Moreover many Afghans are of different tribal groups and don’t/didn’t really have any loyalty to the government in Kabul.

Material and money is a super important component. Wars are won by strategy, training, leadership, bravery and *logistics*.

It's about who's on the short term tactical offensive, not anything on the operational level. Generally (not always or everywhere) the pattern was that the operational attacker would make initial gains with a favourable casualty ratio, run out of steam, and then be subjected to a successful counterattack in which the casualty ratios reversed and then some. The net result would be little or no permanent change in territorial control and higher casualties for the side on the operational offensive, but at any given time the side on the tactical offensive would be experiencing a favourable casualty ratio. Obviously losses on both sides would be massive throughout. 

This points to an expectation that Ukrainian casualties in the Donbas should be exceeding Russian ones given that Russia has a large advantage in artillery numbers and is on the tactical offensive more of the time than Ukraine. This may however be offset by Russian tactical ineptitude (in the attempted river crossings near Bilohorivka, for example) and the very poor quality of some of the Russian-aligned forces.

The article makes a few often made criticism of the quality of PLA, including lack of wartime experience, too rigid command structure, lack of NCO in command positions and too much time spent on political indoctrination, 

The article is well structured and succinct. While I might disagree with some of the article's arguments, it is still worth a read. Although just as the article argues that ""The PLA has resorted to attempting to gain some war experience and reduce this gap by reading books on war"", it feels like the author learned about the PLA by reading books.

&gt;It's not a popular opinion and gets downvoted but

It gets downvoted because people like you don't realize that Russia's current position and actions are completely unreasonable in light of their geostrategic position just prior to the invasion. Russia would try to seize the entirety of Ukraine ala the suppression of the Prague Spring. You really have no sense of the context of this invasion.

Here's a harsh truth for you: I shared Mearsheimer's position on this conflict up to Putin's decision to attempt to seize the entirety of Ukraine via Thunder Runs on strategic Ukrainian cities. Putin's decision to attempt an incredibly outdated strategy on Ukraine despite obvious signs that it would fail indicates that the Russian government is not acting defensively, but from the mindset that they are a global power that will unite the Slavic people into a power bloc centered on Moscow. The victory manifesto accidentally released by Russian state media only days into the conflict confirms this.

Mearsheimer's recent commentary is completely out of date. He is an irrelevant Cold War apparatchik that had a legitimate point about NATO expansion decades ago and he's coasted on that ever since. There is nothing of note in his career and, quite frankly, offensive neorealism has always irked me as little more than an inverse of defensive neorealism.

The study of rapes in this war will surely be topic of future research and investigation. Whether the original commenter knows it or not this subject is a good subject for a peer reviewed research paper. Calling for legitimate numbers and information is a start in this process of study, and hopefully accountability. So I see the topic as being legitimate, if hard to stomach. 

From a military perspective the question should not be whether a collection of humans is capable of having rapists within it (it is unfortunately part of the human condition), but what the Russian leadership is going to do about preventing rapes and disciplining the soldiers who are accused of raping. So far the Russians have done next to nothing on both counts.

I do not agree with the statement that the issue is overblown, as the lack of accountability and discipline within the Russian military combined with the fact that rapes are often unreported; lead one to make the conclusion that rapes by Russian military members have been a common occurrence in the past and they will continue to be common as the leadership will do nothing to change the situation. So on one hand I see it as being beneficial to call for research into the phenomenon of rapes, but on the other it is foolish to hope for a realistic number that can be seen as credibly reliable from which to make conclusions at this point in the war. The number of rapes being allowed is of course intolerably high, as rape should not be tolerated at all by any human organization. 

At the same time it is extremely unlikely that the majority of the Russian military are rapists as most probably have never interacted with local civilians, and acts of evil and sociopathy is not common to the majority of individual humans. This however does nothing to assuage the guilt of the Russian military as a whole as the leadership represents the whole, as they are responsible for the acts that their men commit (positive or negative) and they are required to maintain good order and discipline. So each Russian soldier overall is unlikely to be a rapist, but the leadership accepts and condones rapes being done by its members, so yes it is an organization that rapes as policy. This is of course wholly unacceptable and calling them a criminal organization is legitimate and prosecuting the leadership for being members of it in a court of law is appropriate in my eyes. 

What is interesting from a sociological perspective is that the perpetrator of the child rape video was arrested and disciplined. This seems to indicate that there are things which the Russian military, public, or leadership, still find offensive enough to do something about. So this does prove that they could take proper action if so motivated, the fact that they are unmotivated by rapes of anyone else who is not a child on video tape is absolutely damning.",178ba90aaf4d152e28bb435eb88edaf6934cad4a,True,False,,,,,0,1654922796,,0,{},ibxx2tj,False,t3_v965k3,False,True,t1_ibx6ewq,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v965k3/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_10_2022/ibxx2tj/,1654922813,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654893996.0

Home field advantage. Artillery is not just about the number of guns and the shells for those guns. It's about knowing where to shoot and when to shoot. For any distance weapon, ground forces are needed to identify targets and to gather intelligence. Drones can help with that, but air power will never out do a moderately equipped foot soldier with a radio. 

By all accounts, Russian infantry and drone warfare is shit. So even though they have more guns, it's likely the majority of the shooting is area affect which is just not very effective. It's a brutal psychological weapon, but very survivable by the infantry under attack with basic tactics like fox holes, being covert, spreading out, in buildings, or just moving into cover. Nothing like being attacked by us air power. 

Basically, artillery will never break an enemies back. It'll just grind them to oblivion slowly. With the intensity of fighting, I don't think Russia has a year for artillery to grind Ukraine's forces down. They'll be out of ground forces by the end of summer. They'll have guns, but the guns won't know where to shoot without infantry.

&gt; This week, partisan scouts working for Ukraine’s military behind enemy lines directed artillery attacks on two Russian bases in the occupied Kherson region that killed scores of enemy soldiers, according to a senior Ukrainian military official with knowledge of the attacks.

&gt; In one episode this week, the scouts approached a Russian army installation in the village of Chkalove, and discovered many foreign fighters stationed at the base along with Russian soldiers and heavy weaponry, the senior official said. They fed the coordinates for the base to a Ukrainian artillery unit stationed about 12 miles away.

&gt; The Ukrainians then pulverized the base with shells, killing scores of fighters just after midnight on Thursday, said the senior official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military operations.

&gt; Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, confirmed the attack and said about 200 fighters had been killed.

Actually, that's incredibly likely.

Here are recent Ukrainian casualty estimates:

\-[Zelenskyy, May 22](https://kyivindependent.com/uncategorized/zelensky-ukraine-may-be-loosing-up-to-100-soldiers-fighting-in-the-east-every-day/): 50 - 100 KIA daily just in the Donbas  
\-[Zelenskyy, May 31](https://www.newsmax.com/newsmax-tv/volodymyr-zelenkskyy-ukraine-war-invasion/2022/05/31/id/1072344/): 60 - 100 KIA, 500 WIA daily - probably refers just to the Donbas  
\-[Reznikov, June 9](https://twitter.com/nexta_tv/status/1534860690342694914?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw): up to 100 KIA, 500 WIA daily - again, probably just for the Donbas  
\-[Podolyak, also June 9](https://www.bbc.com/ukrainian/news-61752749?xtor): 100 - 200 KIA daily - by inference, probably refers to the entire front

Compare to UA claims of Russian-aligned personnel ""liquidated"" since the beginning of Russia's ""Phase 2"" Offensive:

\-Week of April 21 - 28: 1,800 --&gt; 257 daily  
\-Week of April 28 - May 5: 1,900 --&gt; 271 daily

I highly recommend this article wot anyone who has read about the US efforts in Afghanistan or Iraq and wants to know why things went wrong with their militaries and what should be done differently next time. 

—————————

&gt; * But some of the same incapacity at higher levels of the defense enterprise that doomed the U.S. effort in Afghanistan also exists in Georgia. Understanding why this is, and how the U.S. can address the shortcomings in its approach, is the focus of the rest of this article. 

&gt; * …visits to these same (Georgian) battalions by U.S. advisors months after they have been trained show serious erosion of the capabilities built with U.S. help. Problems like missing or inoperable equipment, poorly trained personnel, personnel shortages, and lack of logistical support are endemic.

&gt; * In Afghanistan, Georgia was the #1 per capita contributor of forces and the #4 overall contributor until the end of the mission this year. In both Iraq and Afghanistan, Georgian forces operated largely free of national caveats and did the hard fighting that many NATO Allies avoided.

&gt; * …the cause of the problem lies in three factors that are present in Georgia, but also characterize many U.S. military assistance programs around the world.

&gt; * The problem with a focus on the operating force is that the units that do the fighting can’t generate and sustain themselves. Absent a significant investment in the generating force, it is inevitable that the readiness of Georgian units will erode after the completion of a U.S. assistance program. This is because the generating force performs the functions critical to sustaining the readiness of the operating force.

&gt; * There are three major problems with this pattern, which has repeated itself time and again in U.S. military assistance efforts…

&gt; * First, as it has with GDRP, future U.S. assistance should focus on building a country’s capacity to defend itself rather than its capacity to deploy in support of U.S. and coalition operations. 

&gt; * Second, rather than focusing on the operating force, U.S. assistance should focus on the generating force and executive levels, which are critical to building and sustaining capacity. 

&gt; * Finally, the U.S. needs to carefully consider and consistently enforce any requirements written into the agreements that underpin U.S. capacity-building efforts.

&gt; * While this article has focused on Georgia, its lessons are applicable to many countries where U.S. capacity-building programs are underway.

We have to distinguish something here. To say that it has no redeeming qualities is inaccurate, and isn’t really a fair reading of the article, even though it is very critical. 

Second, the article’s specific conclusions being wrong in no way diminish the real functional, and institutional problems that the russian military does have. This is an oddly common fallacy; someone diagnosed the problem incorrectly, therefore there is no problem.

&gt; The question I am asking is - why do soldiers fight so hard for such a bad army?

I gave you multiple examples of people who continued to materially support systems that brutalize them. Whether it is slaves being worked literally to death in cotton fields, or a wife continuing to run the household of her abusive husband, human psychology is complicated.

To give a more narrowly focused answer on Russia specifically:
1. The wage they pay is competitive compared to similar economic opportunities and I have not seen indications that soldiers are commonly denied their wages.
2. As other people have pointed out, once you’re in the shit, you’re in the shit and you just try to keep going, survive, keep your friends alive.
3. A lot of the fighting is via artillery or standoff weapons, which don’t lend themselves neatly to surrender.
4. The substantial interest any army has in not letting their troops rout or surrender. Some of the accounts you have posted suggested there is a rather extensive system of officers who are assigned to bring back “strays” and use a mix of incentives and force to try and convince them to go back to the fight.

Meanwhile Russia won in Chechnya and got the Chechens to fight for them, won in Georgia over US reformed forces, is kicking the crap out of the Ukrainians now and the entirety of NATO cannot keep up with the supplies necessary, and Russia is profiting more off of its energy resources than ever while ironing out the kinks in their armed forces and supply chains while building up powerful allies and networks of favorable nations (aka 3/4ths of the countries on earth not going along with US sanctions).  Plus Russia is economically more powerful now than they were 20 years ago with powerful allies like China and now the natural resources of much of Ukraine (they occupy ~50% of Ukrainian GDP).
