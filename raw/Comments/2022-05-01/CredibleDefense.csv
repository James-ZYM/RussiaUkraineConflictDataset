Key Takeaways

Russian occupying forces are setting conditions to allow Russia to permanently govern occupied areas in southern Ukraine, not just in Donbas.

Ukrainian forces likely conducted a rocket artillery strike on a Russian command post in Izyum on April 30 that struck after Russian Chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov had left but killed other senior Russian officers.

Russian forces continue to make incremental advances moving southwestward in the direction of Lyman but are largely stalled against Ukrainian positions on the pre-February 24 frontline.

Russian forces continued re-grouping and reconnaissance on the Southern Axis and did not make any confirmed advances.",ad3f9d41b39fdd814e0c92a49ba893d1038cc58f,True,False,,,,,0,1651447262,,0,{},i6yq4gn,False,t3_ufyebi,False,True,t3_ufyebi,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ufyebi/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_01_2022/i6yq4gn/,1651447279,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651418462.0,

* Gradually get stuff from NATO capable of handling the Black Sea Fleet, or at least forcing them to stay so far away from the coast that they're a nonfactor. Hell, even just setting up Neptune missiles (with their 190 mile range) in Crimea would [cut the Black Sea in half](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/288384905195552769/970456481935790150/unknown.png) from the Russian perspective; and while I'm no expert, I assume that would be enough to keep the Russians from blocking trade to Odesa.

* Push up to the Russian border and try to get a peace deal from a position of strength.

---

* If the Russians say **no,** or they refuse to agree to presumably vital terms (like the return of the hundreds of thousands of forcibly evacuated Ukrainians)- and if, subsequently, they continued to shell Ukrainian cities- Ukraine could probably start pushing *into* Russia. 

  * This sounds ludicrous on its face, but any scenario where Ukraine even gets this far is one where Russia's military has already lost the ability to resist Ukraine's advances. Additionally, recall that Ukraine just keeps getting more and better equipment, while Russia's equipment resources are effectively finite.

Pushing into Russia would be (at least in the Russians' eyes) a dangerous escalation, and worse still, an unacceptable blow to their national pride. It would massively increase the chances that Russia might resort to the use of nuclear weapons- after all, who could tell Putin no while there are invaders on their soil?

Assuming they didn't use nuclear weapons, though, Ukraine in this hypothetical could probably push a little bit into Russia, then fortify like there's no tomorrow. The conflict would be ongoing, but it would force the Russian artillery out of city-shelling range, which would allow for improved normalcy during the conflict.

&gt; ...during WWII Germany focused its production on high quality but difficult to manufacture equipment compared with the allied who prioritized quantity over quality. As a result, Germany produced a fraction of the number of tanks that the US did let alone the USSR or Britain.

The IS and KV tanks never had a good reputation but I am not an expert, they were probably a waste as well. But they were also not a part of a larger pattern of new and expensive weaponry that didn't work out in the same way that it was for the Germans.

It's a simple mathematical equation Hughes created to attempt to analyze the comparative combat power of two naval formations. It can also be used to compare surface navy units against other types on units, such as shore batteries as seen in this article.

The equation is the number of ""well aimed"" missiles fired by a given number of naval units, minus the number destroyed by the opposing force, over the total number of hits required to put one vessel out of action.

The problem is, the Salvo model has no actual basis in reality, as naval engagements are far more complicated than this.

How can you state by simple fiat that a warship can shoot down X number of missiles? Or that Y number of missiles can put a warship out of action? What is required to derive these numbers in the first place? It ends up being a mess that produces data that is at best worthless, often worse than worthless because the equation innately favors small vessels over big ones, despite plenty of real-world data showing that small missile boats lose badly to large warships.

In fact, the Salvo Model was one factor that put the USN on the road to the Littoral Combat Ship.

Such analysis is performed infinitely better by true wargaming and simulation techniques that attempt to take the actual qualities of systems into account.",6437c24a908c2b31e4e7c119007dbcb585a4b99b,True,False,,,,,0,1651444100,,0,{},i6yjdcq,False,t3_ufjqbn,False,True,t1_i6xzeww,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ufjqbn/neptunes_the_moskva_and_how_not_to_sink_a_cruiser/i6yjdcq/,1651444116,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651415300.0,

They're a long ways off from being able to take down a missile outright. To do so would require being able to focus the beam on the same spot of the missile for a extended period of time, depending on the power of the laser and distance to the target. Focusing a laser on a missile going subsonic in the exact same place sounds hard enough, but what about when they're supersonic or beyond? Or if they make constant evasive action to prevent being targeted at the same spot? When the range increases all lasers are subject to thermal bloom, some of the power of the beam is to lost interaction with the atmosphere being turned into heat.

An analysis of the available reporting on 2021 training events indicates that amphibious training occurs frequently from March to October but mostly involves units at or below the battalion level. Despite efforts to bolster the PLAA’s amphibious capabilities, the force currently lacks the capacity to execute a large-scale assault on Taiwan.

He knows that he is lacking the hardware to outfit a much bigger army and probably the logistics too. Even if you’re in the camp of „maybe he doesn’t know these things“ there’s also the thesis of people like Kofman that going full war takes control away from putin. With a special military operation he can define what victory looks like within much broader parameters. If it’s full on war he needs to win big or he gets in trouble. Especially because mass mobilization will bring the war closer to home when he cant rely as much on soldiers from the rural parts of Russia far away from the city elites. So overall mobilization seems unlikely.   


A more likely path to nukes is that the UK has spoken openly about helping ukraine take back crimea. Losing that may be so painful that Putin may step up to the line so hard that when the west doesn’t pull back or wants to but can’t make Ukraine go along deescalation he might actually order some kind of nuclear warning shot. But for that to happen, many more steps of nuclear escalation need to happen beforehand. And of course you have to assume he remains in power throughout. In terms of „we really mean it“-preparations we’re basically at step 1/4 or somesuch. If our response is further „lol sure“ when that happens and he is really in a corner maybe he’ll go as far as detonating something somewhere off-field just to make everybody shot their pants for a second but without actually causing mass casualties.

When we're talking about response to nuclear weapons use and the level of escalation that entails, it's pretty important to distinguish between levels of escalation in response. Enforcing a NFZ does not carry the same risk of nuclear war as a ground invasion looking to capture Moscow.

If we approach prevention of nuclear war probabalistically, we have to compare the risk of various forms of response causing a nuclear conflict today versus the risk of encouraging nuclear force in the future. Let's say an NFZ increases likelihood of nuclear conflict in this war by 5%, but the deterrence value decreases future risk by 10% - than obviously an NFZ is the right move. 

I'm *not* saying those numbers are that easily quantifiable, or that an NFZ is necessarily a good idea. But, I am saying that the distinction between various forms of escalation is important.

3. Ukraine Claims as of April 26, 2022: 22,400 Russian Losses https://interfax.com.ua/news/general/827539.html. Ukraine further claims to be in possession of 7K Russian bodies. That seems like a claim likely to backfire fi they don't have those bodies.

7. OSINT Equipment Losses by Oryx from April 26: 3237 vs 920. Ratio of destroyed and captured equipment has been relatively steady for the whole war. 3 to 1. Which is consistent for an attacker operating against a fairly equal opponent with relatively similar troop levels. This should also be consistent with troop ratios of losses.

8. Russian MoD from from March 2, 2022, 498 Russian Losses (Extrapolated to 5,976 over 60 days). Russian MoD from March 25, 2022: 1,351 Russian Losses (Extrapolated to 2702 over 60 days) (Independent Media has already confirmed at least 1700 funerals for soldiers killed in Ukraine just by going through death announcements, invalidating the most recent MoD claim which has not been updated: https://meduza.io/en/feature/2022/04/26/young-men-from-poor-regions)

Here I'm not so sure. The collective West has significantly more economic, financial and industrial power than Russia. Even without Western mobilization, it's conceivable that we can scale up material support sufficiently to maintain equilibrium, if not allow outright Ukrainian victory.

*China Maritime Report No. 20: The PLA Army Amphibious Force*

https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/cmsi-maritime-reports/20/

--------------------

Quotes:

&gt; * If deterrence fails, one military option available to the senior Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership is to order the PLA to conduct an extremely difficult and complex operation known as a joint island landing campaign, which would be supported by a joint firepower campaign. 

&gt; * Although a traditional over-the-beach amphibious landing likely will not be the first military course of action to be undertaken in a campaign directed against Taiwan, the PLA is clearly preparing for this possibility should other options fail.

&gt; * The core of the PLAA’s contribution to the Taiwan deterrence and warfighting missions resides in six amphibious combined arms brigades (ACAB)

&gt; * Once these forces are ashore, Taiwan’s topography is not optimal for rapid, large-scale offensive, mechanized movements. Only a few beaches along its west coast are suitable for amphibious landing and behind them the terrain soon becomes mountainous and checkered with rice paddies and urban sprawl. 

&gt; * Like most of the other PLAA divisions, the 1st Amphibious Mechanized Infantry Division and the 124th Amphibious Infantry Division were disbanded and each transformed into two amphibious combined arms brigades. 
&gt; * The six new amphibious combined arms brigades are structured similar to heavy combined arms brigades, but have been issued amphibious assault guns capable of swimming in the ocean instead of main battle tanks and amphibious infantry fighting vehicles (IFV)/armored personnel carriers (APC), also capable of swimming, instead of vehicles that sink.5 

&gt; * Thus, a full amphibious combined arms brigade amounts to an estimated 5,000 personnel and over 400 vehicles, numbers important for planning how many amphibious ships or craft are needed to transport a complete unit. In total, the six amphibious combined arms brigades command 24 amphibious combined arms battalions and six reconnaissance battalions—units dedicated to being the first wave of an over-the-beach amphibious assault. 

&gt; * Group army artillery brigades would play an important role providing fire support for the invasion. As a result of the 2017 reforms, all are now assigned a battalion of 300mm PHL03 long-range multiple rocket launch systems with a range of 70-160 kilometers, depending on the type of munition. When properly positioned along China’s coasts and offshore islands, these weapons can deliver fire on the Penghu Islands and the beaches from Taichung north on the west coast of Taiwan. 

&gt; * More recently, the longer-range 370mm PCH191 system has been deployed to the three group armies opposite Taiwan with amphibious combined arms brigades, adding a second long-range multiple rocket launch battalion to their artillery brigades.8 This new system greatly expands the area on the mainland from which these units can bring most of Taiwan’s west coast from Tainan north under fire. Group army air defense brigades along the coast will integrate their HQ-16-series medium-range 

&gt; * PLAA helicopter units train less frequently with infantry units, but army aviation brigades provide the group army commander the option of conducting airmobile operations to deliver up to an infantry battalion to seize key terrain, such as airfields, as well as supporting landing operations with reconnaissance and attack helicopters 

&gt; * Except for the 73rd Group Army Aviation Brigade stationed in Fujian, which could make the round-trip flight to Taiwan from their home airfields, other army aviation brigades likely would be required to pre-deploy to forward airfields and field arming and refueling points prior to the start of a major operation. Some assembly and recovery field sites are likely to be situated on offshore islands closer to Taiwan than those on the mainland. In recent years, PLAA helicopter units have practiced operations from PLAN ships and large commercial ships.9 

&gt; * In 2021, the PLA changed from once-a-year conscription to a twice-a-year cycle, in the spring and fall. Depending on how well this policy is implemented, it could significantly raise the level of readiness for “conscript-heavy” units and allow them to take part in more complex training throughout the year. 

&gt; * The modernization of PLAA amphibious and support units demonstrates the capability to conduct amphibious operations. Regular amphibious and combined arms training activities cover most of the specialized and general skills required to carry out a landing against Taiwan, despite the constraints of the conscription system. 

&gt; * However, PLAA amphibious capabilities do not necessary translate into the capacity to effectively launch a large-scale amphibious assault on Taiwan. 

&gt; * Currently, there is no open- source indication of the intention to further increase the number of these forces. Moreover, the PLA lacks the amphibious lift capacity for the approximately 30,000 personnel and more than 2,400 vehicles of the six amphibious combined arms brigades.25 

&gt; * The PLAA may be capable of more modest aims. As the U.S. Department of Defense assessed in its 2021 report: 
&gt;       ""The PLA is capable of attempting various amphibious operations short of a full-scale invasion of Taiwan. With few overt military preparations beyond routine training, the PRC could launch an invasion of small Taiwan-occupied islands in the South China Sea such as Pratas or Itu Aba. A PLA invasion of a medium-sized, better-defended island such as Matsu or Jinmen is within the PLA’s capabilities.""26

Particularly interesting is how wage growth has far outstripped productivity growth - China is not cheap anymore. 

Energy: A bigger export from Russia is probably possible - but it will take a looooooong time before it is not ship-borne.

Of course - another angle is that Europe has some of the same weaknesses mentioned above.

Same goes for the Soviet Union, who were not only well into a massive force increase and mobilization when they were invaded but were ending a second five-year plan to massively expand industrial production in their country. 

The US didn't really open up funding for expansion until 1937 and most of that went to the USAAC but it expanded for everyone else by 1940, and that only worked because they'd been planning to mobilize the economy since mid 1920s with heavy staff work, plans drafted in the mid 30s (to include by a certain Major Eisenhower, which is why the the Army Industrial College, later the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, is now officially called the Eisenhower School for National Security and Resource Strategy.

How does that compare now: Was Russia already massively increasing its military for the last half decade, so they could use that as a template? Did they plan to massively increase it in the future? Did they plan to mobilize their economy? Do they know which factories making civilian goods can switch over to military weapons and exactly what's needed to turn them into productive factories with trained workers? Do they know what they'd need to build from scratch, where to build it, how to build it? Did they already design a workable reserve system to massively expand their military in an effective and rapid manner to use all that new equipment? No to every one of those, including the last, because the Russian MOD knew their reserve system sucked and wanted to fix it but didn't get a chance before this war started.

Even without sanctions Russia can't replicate what the major powers of WW2 could accomplish. But then again neither can any other country, besides China maybe.

https://defence-blog.com/germany-to-supply-the-ukrainian-army-with-heavy-tank-transporter-vehicles/
&gt;**Berlin is planning to supply** upgraded 4×4 vehicles, armored trucks, tactical buses, and nearly **100 HX81 heavy tractor-trailer systems to Ukraine** as the Russian offensive in the eastern Donbas region escalates.

[..]

&gt;The [**HX81 heavy tank transporter vehicle**](https://imgur.com/vlEfEig) was jointly developed by MAN and Rheinmetall.

&gt;The vehicle is based on an 8×8 MAN HX-series chassis. **Germany’s new tractor-trailer systems will be used for transporting tracked and wheeled vehicles**, containers and heavy equipment.

So.... with 100 tank transporting trucks I'd imagine bringing 200 tanks across the border in a distributed fashion wouldn't be so difficult.

As they're road vehicles with no weaponry I'd assume that anyone with a HGV license could probably drive them with little to no training.",798895ff003ce536dd80cd638ba7b9902a789794,True,False,,,,,0,1651428303,,0,{},i6xjcfq,False,t3_ufyebi,False,True,t1_i6xhgsb,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ufyebi/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_01_2022/i6xjcfq/,1651428321,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651399503.0,

In WW2, the US Army took great steps especially after the Kasserine Pass disaster and the reports of II Corps commander hiding in his bunker to ensure all generals knew they were expected to risk their lives and that they too were expendable. 

Eisenhower never visited the very front but other generals did as a point (Ike didn't want to feign being a combat leader, which he knew he wasn't). Commanders of army groups, field armies, and corps regularly went forward to division and regimental HQs and might occasionally visit forward lines. Division commanders or their assistants were expected to daily visit their forward units to the point that during the Normandy campaign if First Army commander visited a division HQ and saw both the commander and ADC present they were both relieved of command for cause. Regimental commanders regularly visited the front lines, battalions commanders occasionally led attacks but were nearly always on or near the front lines, company commanders so regularly led and took point the Army had to try to make a concerted effort to stop it because they were taking too many casualties. The only reason more US generals weren't killed was a bit of luck but mostly their enemy didn't have the means to target them.

A ""sort of war"" is not the same as ""an actual invasion with foreign troops on your territory, and actual artillery barrages potentially being targetted by behind the lines spies"".

A rhetorical ""war"" is not the same as an actual ""war"".

So, no. China wouldn't be justified in the same way Ukraine is right now with *actual foreign troops actually shooting people within their actual country*.

&gt;Speaking up your mind should never be cause for arrest. Sure lock up anyone actually collaborating, but regarding those who simply support putin, Ukraine is going to reconcile with the fact that these people exist inside Ukraine, as absurd as their opinion is.

When at war..... Openly supporting the forces invading your country is absolutely valid grounds for suspicion that ""this guy might be a spy"".

Its perfectly good grounds for arresting him, taking his tech, and searching that tech to make sure he isn't passing sensistive military information to the enemy. Which is what Ukraine is doing.

There is no indication at all that (should that search not find anything like that) he wouldn't be released...... and in similar cases recently, the ""pro-putin blogger"" was arrested in just this way and later released, unharmed, un-tortured, and with merely a warning that ""we've got our eye on you and their may be charges later if we discover you're going beyond just expressing your views and onwards into outright providing information to the enemy"".

*At the time* russo-phile twitter was all abuz about how he'd been arrested by the SBU, would probably be executed, certainly be tortured, and how this presaged a new Ukranian police state.

Then he turned up a few days later perfectly fine, and reporting that he hadn't been tortured and all they'd done is confiscate his tech for further investigation.

&gt;For clarification, I'm generally against the criminalisation of any idea, even hateful ones like neonazism. I won't go as far as saying free speech should be free of consequences, but the criminalisation of ideas is such an extreme because it mostly lead to brutal police states, even if the initial intentions were pure.

Fine. But just as the US in WWII would have been justified in thinking ""This Japanese guy who has spent the last month pinning pro-Tojo posters to all the noticeboards in town might be a Japanese spy, we ought to raid his house and check him out""...... Its legitimate for the UA military to raid this guy's house and check him out.

&gt;All that said, I'm fully aware of the heroic work of ukranian police in stopping sabouters and collaborators daily and I don't envy the task of doing so while still protecting due process and individual rights.

And.... I'll agree with you IF he ends up being ""jailed for 15 years for the crime of posting pro-russian stuff on twitter"" (as the equivalent russian may be jailed).

But all I'm seeing right now is a guy arrested for investigation, where (so long as he hasn't provided sensistive info to ""his uncle in Belgograd"") I'd expect him to be released later, minus his tech, with one hell of a scare thrown into him.",86d5c18ea4c938ac2168a10b78d4819bd430a3e7,True,False,,,,,0,1651427614,,0,{},i6xhq97,False,t3_ufyebi,False,True,t1_i6xg1l6,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ufyebi/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_01_2022/i6xhq97/,1651427626,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651398814.0,

&gt; * Leveraging the same proven chassis as the Panzer III, Sturmgeschütz III commonality meant that spare parts were in plentiful supply, making it easy to support and maintain. 

&gt; * Mechanical simplicity ensured it was easy to repair. Training was straightforward. With a driver, gunner, loader and commander, the vehicle was simple to operate and proved to be popular with its crews.

&gt; * ...it delivered a disproportionately high number of tank kills relative to other more capable German tanks.

&gt; * Less weight also meant that it put less strain on its drivetrain, so broke down less frequently than other German tanks. It enjoyed the highest availability rating of any German tracked combat vehicle.

[],False,,klugez,,,[],,,,text,t2_33f99,False,False,"In general NATO opponents in Finland have argued that:

1. We have good relations with Russia, better than we could as a NATO member. Good relations help to keep peace.
2. We have over 1300 kilometers of border, those good relations are important in peacetime. Tension there would be a problem even if Article 5 would prevent Russia from outright attack.
3. Trade with Russia is economically significant and enabled by these good relations. For example right to fly over Russia is vital for Finnair because it allows shorter routes to Asia. If trade shut down, Finland effectively becomes an island because only other ground borders are to northern Sweden and Norway, which are not economically useful. Or even worse than island, because you couldn't even sail east.
4. Avoiding creating an Iron Curtain 2.0 by staying friendly with both Russia and the West is conducive to peace between NATO and Russia also, because NATO isn't suffocating Russia.
5. We would have to be ready to provide military aid based on Article 5 to other countries. Some have been unwilling to do that in general, others worry about changes that would be made in Finnish Defense Forces to enable that. (Finnish defense is based on widespread conscription and large reserve. It's accepted that you might be forced to defend your own country. But forced to go somewhere else?)
6. Some people don't believe that NATO countries would *actually* provide help if we were attacked. Everyone remembers how in Winter War nobody except Sweden helped significantly and even they didn't send soldiers.
7. Far left hates USA too much to accept being in an alliance with them. Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, Guantanamo Bay and so on. Some of them are also peace activists who are against military alliances in general because they prevent disarmament.

Russia's attack into Ukraine has changed things considerably. Good relations with Russia are gone. After Finland took part in EU sanctions and sent weapons to Ukraine, Russia explicitly listed us as an unfriendly country. Sanctions and countersanctions destroyed trade anyway.

There's not the space to have good relations to both West and Russia anymore. So Iron Curtain is back and there's a need to choose on which side of it you are. Finns are not finding that a difficult choice - we've just collectively been wishing the choice didn't have to be made.

There's also the question of how sufficient our own defense is as a deterrent. We've kind of thought that of course Russia wouldn't attack because victory would be uncertain and even in the absolute best case there would be more than a hundred thousand casualties on Russia's side. (Finnish war time strengh is 280 000 soldiers and Russia doesn't have a qualitative technology edge, even though it might have a quantitative one.)  But of course Russia is showing in Ukraine that it's willing to spill a lot of Russian blood for territorial gains.

&gt; * Reconstruction elsewhere may offer insights. Transparency was key in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Agricultural land reform and education helped the South Korean economy take off in the years following a devastating war. In Europe after World War II, restoring industry, providing financing to eliminate bottlenecks in inputs, and liberalizing trade spurred remarkable growth. These are among the factors that could spur rebuilding in Ukraine.

&gt; * In 2020, the average age of the housing stock was 46 years. New buildings comprised only 3 percent.

&gt; * Effective reconstruction will require a better investment climate, deeper reforms, and less corruption.

&gt; * Economic and rule-of-law reforms may be most important. 

&gt; * Ukraine has languished in the bottom one-third in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index. Donor and investor fatigue could set in if Ukraine's reconstruction program were burdened by stifling corruption.

&gt; * Perhaps impressive war-time patriotism will lead to greater impatience with corruption.

&gt; * It is uncertain whether the West would seek forfeiture of some or all of the $300 billion or so in blocked assets of the Russian Central Bank held in the West. Legal issues could be complex, but political pressures could favor applying these resources to reconstruction.

&gt; * The IMF projects that this year debt may rise to 70 percent of GDP. Debt relief has often been crucial to economies rebuilding from crisis, as with Poland in the early 1990s. But again, reforms could better persuade creditors to lower Ukraine's debts.

--------------

In the years preceding the current war, one of the most dominant themes about Ukraine has been its incredible corruption. Even now during the war we have seen supposed gangsters attacking soldiers, and the wife of a politician trying to bring millions out of the country. This has been the major impediment to investment and I see it now as the biggest challenge in rebuilding Ukraine. 

I am hopeful that the war will create a desire for change and reform in Ukraine, the desire to join the European Union naturally implies that there is a will to comply with the reforms the EU. So that is a good sign.

The billions of Russian money seized by the West will hopefully be used to rebuild Ukraine, but I do not know the legal challenges to that.

**Russia planned downing passenger jet, blaming Ukraine – Security Service of Ukraine**

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claims to have apprehended a Russian sabotage and reconnaissance group that was preparing to shoot down a passenger plane and blame it on the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the international partners supplying arms to Ukraine.

Source: SBU Spokesperson Artem Dekhtyarenko

Quote: ""The SBU has completed a multistage operation, in the course of which it neutralised a a deep-seated sabotage and reconnaissance group of the enemy.  Agents of the RF armed forces’ general staff were preparing a terrorist act – they were planning to shoot down a passenger jet over the territory of Russia or Belarus.

""The occupiers intended to unjustifiably accuse Ukraine and our partners of attacking the aircraft. To commit the provocation, the attackers wanted to fire on a civilian board from the portable anti-aircraft missile system (MANPADS) ‘Stinger’.

""In order to steal and smuggle foreign MANPADS abroad, representatives of the aggressor country's special services gave the [relevant] task to their intelligence group.""

According to the SBU, the sabotage and reconnaissance group included two individuals with dual citizenships, and a locally recruited accomplice.

Their operations were coordinated by Russian national Aleksandr Tuterev, a staff member of the main department of the general staff of the RF’s armed forces under the alias of ""Morpekh"", says Dekhtyarenko.

Tuterev is wanted in Ukraine for his role in the organisation of a series of terrorist acts in the Odesa region, according to the SBU.

Under his coordination, enemy agents attempted to contact Ukraine’s Armed Forces under the guise of patriotic volunteers. To gain trust, they conveyed to the Ukrainian side true information on the positions and maneuvres of Kadyrevites’ units.

The agents were allegedly tasked with using these contacts to illegally obtain a foreign-made MADPAD and transfer it to the Russian side.

The SBU reports that it has apprehended all members of the involved sabotage and reconnaissance group.

The investigation is ongoing.",0f5f12a35e7aba3c8551ffca1cf18c9483992b23,True,False,,,,,0,1651422371,,0,{},i6x5huj,False,t3_ufyebi,False,True,t1_i6x0nyk,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ufyebi/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_01_2022/i6x5huj/,1651422383,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651393571.0,

[],False,,SmokingPuffin,,,[],,,,text,t2_8f0cw,False,False,"&gt;I would even go as far to say as it is inevitable (Now of course you can disagree with that) that China will surpass the US. The issue is will the US be able to accept and live in a world where China is the dominant power? Or at the very least, can they accept a China that is equal in status?

I don't know if China will surpass the US or not. China has both powerful advantages and disadvantages. It is certainly the strongest revisionist power America has ever faced.

It's rational for America to back down if China becomes clearly the strongest power. Even a world where China is 3x as powerful as America, America's territory could not be meaningfully threatened. America has an unbelievable margin of safety due to its geography, which tends to make American leaders forget how it feels to be some other nation with genuine security concerns. 

Of course, no hegemon willingly concedes primacy, even if it were convinced the new candidate is the best thing since sliced bread. Competition is inevitable at the transition.

&gt;It is the west that is doing everything it can to prevent that with whatever means necessary. In this situation, is it the Chinese that needs to change, or is it the west? Whos the one standing in the way of world peace? And dare I even ask, Who is the one who is immoral in this situation?

In this story of alleged Western immorality, you have forgotten the Taiwanese utterly. Reunification with Taiwan would be unpreventable by the west if Taiwanese were even mildly inclined to join with the mainland. Taiwan stands apart because that is its will. Why do Taiwanese dislike China so strongly? Answering that question is the key to reunification.

&gt;**Moral Standpoint. ""**China cannot lead the world because they are immoral. It would be a moral issue. We are good and therefore we cannot allow evil to triumph. We would not just be ""better"" leaders but ""morally good"" leaders. Now this is in my point the main excuse and core issue that the west uses to contain China.

As a realist, I think morality is largely window dressing in statecraft. American media will often put a frosting of heroism on whatever action America is choosing to take. Even objectively immoral actions like the war in Iraq get frosted. No actual decision makers think this way. This is like reading Global Times and thinking that's how Chinese decision makers think.

Personally, my main concern with Chinese primacy is that China is absolutely allergic to criticism. America is fine with being criticized. China has a tendency to cut diplomatic ties, hold up business in red tape, and so on, whenever a minor nation has the gall to criticize something China is doing. That's even when there is some justification, like when Australia complained China isn't investigating the origin of covid or the UK complained China isn't living up to its commitments in Hong Kong. If China is going to be the hegemon, it can't fly off the handle like it does today.

&gt;I feel the only way we are going to have peace in the world is if Americans accept that you can't be number 1 forever. Work with China. Let them take bigger responsibilities. With great power comes great responsibilities. They would soon need to protect their investments and maintain world order or they would suffer too.

From the American perspective, an honest effort was made to work with China. There was rapproachement in the late 70s, leading up to economic engagement in the 90s. American policy from roughly 1975-2005 was to help China grow economically in the hope that China would become a more liberal and friendly state. In particular, the American plan for resolving Taiwan was always that the mainland would become more like Taiwan as it became richer, leading to peaceful reunification.

Needless to say, that really didn't work out for America. China took the economic benefits America offered and only became more hardened in their view that the current world order is unacceptable.

The result America was hoping for in China was something like the result of the 1980s competition with Japan, where now Japan is rich, friendly, and America's strongest ally in the world. You say that Japan has been castrated, but I think they could still pose a major threat to America if they wished. For example, an alliance between China and Japan would surely be able to push America out of East Asia. They just don't want to. They've decided that the current world order works well for them.",698ef5b9c07f05eaec470a3d83c7269e4a094818,True,False,,,,,0,1651419550,,0,{},i6wyzzm,False,t3_u7ixz8,False,True,t1_i6vz4a3,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u7ixz8/chinas_grand_strategy_dr_mastro_of_stanford/i6wyzzm/,1651419561,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651390750.0,

Not in some Caesar in Gaul, don the red cape, type fashion, but stopping by the HQ to show the flag. They come to the front, take the temperature of the room, see and hear briefings from the Army and maybe division staffs, and then go into an office and scream at whomever needs to be screamed at. Maybe while hes there he can toss out a few medals to people. 

This sort of thing is very common. One of the great mistakes modern generals make is to do what von Moltke the Younger or Maurice Gamelin tried to do. Gamelin was convinced that the radio would solve the problems of command. So he set himself up in 1939 in some old and centrally located French castle. He thought he could just pick up the phone and call for a report and know the condition of any unit under his command. But this centralized system fell apart when the realities of modern warfare struck: by the time a report would filter up far enough to reach Gamelin it would be out of date. In the French GHQ they would be drawing defensive lines the Germans had already captured. Something similar happened with Moltke, who built his command center on telegraph connections. When the lines were cut he had no idea what was happening at the front. But rather than get off his butt, he sent out a staff officer. According to Holger Herwig the decision to retreat from the Marne was made by an LTC, and of course probably cost Germany the war. 

These are well known lessons, and even in the Russian/Soviet system the ideal officer commanded from the front. Yes he risked becoming a casualty, but he also minimized the chances that his HQ would become a bubble of unreality and wishful thinking. The goal was to get away from group think and listen to each of his subordinates and get their honest and frank opinion on the state of things. By comparison, in the Sinai 1973 the Israeli divisional commanders and their Army commander had frequent in person meetings at army HQ. After Gonen, who was a bit incompetent, was repalced with Bar-Lev, the meetings happened almost every day or night depending on the situations. At these meetings each division general would air their mind, sometimes they would get into big arguments and fights over this or that, and then they would settle on a unified plan and go back to their units to carry it out.

They depend upon subassemblies and parts from other companies and production lines.

&gt; * ...it has become increasingly apparent such weapons are neither cheap nor available in unlimited numbers.

&gt; * ...the United States cannot count on similar help should the roles be reversed.

&gt; * The war in Ukraine is but the most recent reminder that 21st century warfare is munitions intensive.

&gt; * The effectiveness of precision weaponry against invading Russian forces has been impressive but has also highlighted the fact that the current U.S. munitions infrastructure is not robust enough to support a high-intensity, protracted conflict against a major adversary such as Russia or China. 

&gt; * ...the requirement for greater investment in munitions is a recurring finding of wargames and strategic choices exercises...

&gt; * The war in Ukraine has highlighted lethality of modern precision weapons on the battlefield, but also the fragility of the current munitions base.

&gt; * The United States cannot enter the next war with inadequate stocks of precision munitions, nor would it be acceptable to cut off allies from resupply in order to husband limited stockpiles for its own defense. 

&gt; * Rather, the United States needs to work with its close allies to both increase their collective munitions stockpiles and production capacity while also adopting innovative approaches to munitions production.

* Tensions between Morocco and Algeria have risen lately, and there is now a heightened risk of armed conflict arising.

* The escalation is rooted in the dispute over the status of Western Sahara, where Morocco appears to feel that its claim to sovereignty is gaining international support.

* Morocco and Algeria have significant relationships with Israel and Russia respectively, but they also have important partners in common that could play a role in preventing the standoff from worsening.

* Morocco and Algeria have interests in Europe that the EU and member states can use to minimise tensions, and reduce the risk of instability and increased migration flows across the Mediterranean.

* To achieve this, Europeans should strike a more balanced relationship with Morocco that does not alienate Algeria while also aiming to solidify its engagement with Algeria.

-------------------

&gt; * Any direct military exchanges between Algeria and Morocco would bring two of Africa’s largest military forces into conflict. An arms race between the two rivals is already under way, and both have ties to advanced weapons manufacturers. 

&gt; * Algeria is a military giant: its defence budget in 2020 was $9.7 billion, the largest in Africa. Just under 70 per cent of Algeria’s military hardware comes from Russia. It was due to receive an order of 14 Su-34 attack jets this year and has reportedly been discussing the purchase of the Su-57 stealth fighter. 

&gt; * Morocco’s budget is smaller, at $4.8 billion in 2020, but that already represented a 54 per cent increase since 2011, and defence spending is due to increase to $5.5 billion in 2022. Moreover, Morocco is in the middle of a major upgrade of its forces, including a reported $500m air defence deal with Israel. Morocco and Israel signed a defence agreement in November 2021 that committed the two countries to cooperate on the exchange of information, joint projects, and arms sales.

&gt; * Spain’s recent shift in position provoked Algeria to recall its ambassador for consultations and review the price it charges Spain for gas

My Opinion:

This is yet another large scale conventional conflict brewing just outside of Europe's borders. Although not having the potential to be as large as the current Ukraine conflict, it would still have waves of refugees heading to Europe and gas being used as leverage against European nations. 

I was personally surprised at how long this Cold War in northern Africa has been going on, and just how much money is being spent on it. Algeria spending twice as much on its military as does Egypt, was a shock to me as I always thought of Egypt as the military power of north Africa. 

The use of gas pipelines as leverage against other states is of course remarkably relevant right now, and it is bizarre that it ever had to be debated whether Russia would its gas as a weapon to pressure Europe. This idea is not unique to Russia, it is simply a logical thing to do as the gas pipelines are directly controlled by the state. And any state would be tempted to use its easy to manipulate resource to get what it wants. What people were thinking when they got their economies hooked to Russian gas is a real mystery to me.",35b77039e8a26e763be69b1ba7364278fc4e22ed,True,False,,,,,0,1651413395,,0,{},i6wlugu,True,t3_ug05ju,False,True,t3_ug05ju,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ug05ju/north_african_standoff_how_the_western_sahara/i6wlugu/,1651413413,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651384595.0,

Also a ceasefire would mean the Russians would actually have to remove their spetsnaz and Russian regular units from donbass if Ukraine is victorious.

https://www.jstor.org/stable/2089281

The abstract of this article lists the relevant parts of the USSR population in 1939... 

15-19 = 15,124,176  
20-29 = 30,639,041.

And also lists 48% of the population as male.

(Although this is a historically rather dodgy census number done by Stalin in 1939 where they may have been cooking the books a little, so bear that in mind).

So (dividing the 15-19 by 5) It seems there were about 3.02m 18 yos... and likely 1.51m 18 yo males.

I'm guessing you're looking for ""the total male conscriptable population over the course of WWII"" .... I'd add together the above two figures and divide by 2 (as I think most of the female excess is at older ages).

This would give you the pop between 15-29 at the wars start and 21-35 at the wars end ... and so a decent proxy for conscriptable pop.

This gives us 22.88 million conscriptable men, of which about 1.62m are 18.

Using the 2021 russian stats (which are already spli m/f) we have
 
15-19 = 3.71m

20-24 = 3.45m

25-29 = 4.4m

So a total of 11.56m conscriptable men. So almost exactly half the amount of conscriptable males available to Stalin and 0.74m 18 yo males, so also almost exactly half of the 1939 18 yo figure.",b1b87fecebc3caf515b4507653a4534f6fa98b0a,True,False,,,,,0,1651411834,,0,{},i6wiw3u,False,t3_ufyebi,False,True,t1_i6wdfuf,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ufyebi/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_01_2022/i6wiw3u/,1651411847,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651383034.0,

Obviously I'm joking, but only partially.  There's two distinct centers of power in Russia.  The first is the constitutional/legislative power.    The second is political authority derived from control over major parts of the government, which have been heavily manipulated by Putin.  

The Russian constitution provides that if the president is unable to serve, the prime minister serves in his stead.  He was nominated by Putin in 2020 after Dimitri Medvedev and the rest of the government resigned to allow Putin to make the constitutional changes that removed the limits on his ability to seek re-election an unlimited number of times. 

Nominally, under the Russian constitution, the president is elected by direct election through a six year term.   The federation counsel (the upper legislative house of the Russian Republic aka the Senate) has the constitutional authority to call elections.   Each political party with representatives in the Duma (the russian lower legislative house) can nominate candidates.  

Of the 450 seats in the Current State Duma, 325 are controlled by United Russia, PUtin's political party. 57 are controlled by the Communist Party,  22 by the Liberal Democratic party (the main opposition party led by Vladimir Zhirinovski), and 15 by the ""new people party.""  

So as a legal matter, the prime minister would serve, the federation counsel would call an election, and there would be 1-3 candidates running, and the ""united russia"" candidate would most likely win. 

However, as a practical matter.  Putin gained power via an alliance with powerful economic figures in the country. (Usually described as the ""oligarchs"" who own major parts of the country's economic infrastructure).    His ""deal"" at the time was power in exchange for economic stability.  It remains to be seen what happens with that arrangement when stability is questionable.   But within Putin's government, he has several powerful lieutenants who likely control significant personal power and resources of their own. 

[Nikolai Patrushev](https://newlinesmag.com/reportage/the-second-most-powerful-man-in-russia/) is a top lieutenant of putin and is known as one of the main hawks in his cabinet.  He is the head of the State Security Counsel and has de-facto control over the state security apparatus in Russia.  He is likely, but not certainly, the architecht of many of the ""disappearances"" and ""suicides"" that occasionally make the news.  During his reign, Putin has allegedly feared giving too much political influence to the military and has centralized a lot of power in the State Security apparatus. 

Other top government officials are Dimitri medvedev, the former president and deputy chief of the security counsel, Sergei Lavrov, the foreign minister, and Sergei Shoigu, the defense minister.  Shoigu has reportedly fallen out of favor with the problems with the war in Ukraine and Putin is now directly controlling the war (allegedly).

You absolutely can, and must, distinguish between different degrees of falsehood. ""Releasing only positive true information, and remaining silent on negative true information"" is very different from ""repeatedly denying true information, and outright giving false information"".

Russia is to the extreme end of this spectrum (repeatedly giving outright false information) .... and Ukraine is very near the other end of it (giving positive true information with a positive spin, remaining silent on negative true information).

That has legitimate consequences for how much you should believe information coming from either source in the absence of verification.

Hitler did not have nukes.  Modern nukes are useful for the very reasons you cite.  Nobody wants to end the world on behalf of 44 million strangers when 340 million fellow countrymen are at risk to a distant battle whose outcome is Europe's problem, not ours.  
Sticking our noses in that fight is a sure and certain way to make it our trouble.  
Our Senile Actor In Chief and the entire political class is using mob psychology level manipulative propaganda to drag us towards the abyss of nuclear annihilation under the assumption that that is the only outcome possible from theater level nuclear release.

Or via the literally Ultimate Means of ending all objections.  They are satanically obsessed with it.  
I am here to tell you that it doesn't have to be that way.  WWII was a penny ante Medium Regional Conflict that had all but burned itself out when the British lost at Dunkirk and won in BOB.  
It reignited into a Major Theater War when Hitler made Barbarossa into a no-quarter Vernichtungskrieg act of annihilation and that drunken bipolar sot Churchill pursued night bombing and Soviet Alliance to poke the Germans into remembering Britain was still in a fight that was never theirs.  
But it took the United States' Arsenal of Democracy industrial capacity and standoff from direct attack to turn things into a global conflagration, a true 'World War', which destroyed 60-100 million lives.  With no gain by any of the Allied combatants of territories and resources which is what makes warfare an amalgamatively useful social tool.  Depending on your perspective, it was all for greed or nothing.  
And again, Hitler did not have nuclear weapons nor the ugly potential of setting 7.8 billion people into migratory mode displacement from their barely productive homelands into our own.  As they begin to starve for want of fertilizer and farm tractor fuel.

Not Europe, not 'NATO' but the U.S..

As the actor once said:  ""What do you do?""

Shoot the hostage?

Fine.

Now Ukraine is an irradiated hellscape that no one can occupy, it has no population left to save and it's Donbass, Transnistrian and Crimean gas deposits cannot be bought and sold by the megawealthy Bidens and Clintons and Obamas as a way to exclude Russia (for daring to nationalize their energy industry in the face of rampant Western looting of their banks and economy).

You will buy Russian energy or you will push the entire planet into a global energy crisis which will strip the dollar of it's GRC status as the Ruble becomes king and the Russians dump oil on third world markets at deeply discounted rates and those countries then sell it back to Europe or the U.S. at high markups.

Leaving the already debt ladened Euro and Dollar completely ruined.

Let's be clear here:  nuclear weapons which are in the .1 to .2 KT range are the equivalent of blowing up X10 MOABs inside a football stadium.  There's not gonna be much left of that stadium but the rest of the city around it will be okay.  Change that yield to an ER and now nobody can use the aimpoint for a railhead, on-ramp, bridge, airbase or political/NCA command center for a couple decades.

But the war in the East of Donbass is going to be over long before then as Russian forces are no longer bothered by neutrality act violations by combatants using a 'last Ukrainian' method of furthering their endless greed via proxy warfare.

It is only the West which drops 20-60KT 'battlefield' weapons on cities and calls it a tactical nuke.  Which makes sense since the last and only time it happened it was an utterly unnecessary and LOLW violating act of despotic cruelty. Perpetrated by the U.S..

Are you going to endorse torching Ukrainian cities to 'save them' from Russian occupation too?  Or are you just in a hurry and want to end human civilization if not species for the chance to go straight to strategics in an operational environment where we are not even Article V acting in defense of a NATO country?

We have set an entire country into migratory mode displacement as REAL REFUGEES into Europe, because they can no longer survive in Ukraine.  Without any crops set and with a 33% reduction in GDP, they will be starving to death by the end of this year.

Do you want to know who could save them?  Not the U.S..  We are going to be hands full trying to feed our own economic colonists once Title 42 ends and the whole of Latin American once more acts like they own America.

Russia is entirely self sufficient in food and in fact a primary agro exporter.  While, since the Europeans have decided they are too good to buy Russian oil or gas, even if it freezes and/or disenfranchises their own populations, and crushes their industrial base and currencies, they actually have the oil to help the energy critical Ukrainians get their lands under till.  The are also a primary source of potash fertilizers which the Ukrainians also have no alternative sources for because nations like China and Australia, which are the phosphate alternative, are so overbooked and hording for their own use, that they have none to spare, because this stupid war is DESTROYING THE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS.

This is not the first time such stupidity as 'western negotiated' wars have been started which got out of hand as a means to reignite stagnated economies.  It is the first time stagflation has been /entered into/ as a precursor to war.

In 1918, the Poles began persecuting their Volksdeutsche german speaking populations, throwing them into death camps, robbing their businesses and property, the whole nine yards.  Because of course nobody actually believed in Wilson's Fourteen Point plan to guarantee ethnic self determinism, they just wanted to feed from the still breathing corpse of the Austro Hungarian Empire and it's substate of Germany which, descended from the HRE, had kept the peace in Europe, more or less, for a thousand years.

Germany, utterly broken by the 'Peace With Honor' outcomes of Versailles and St. Germain, could only beg the Poles not to overcharge them as they tried to keep open the land corridor to a predominantly German, now 'Polish Owned and Operated' Danzig.

This began a period of two decades of persecution and nationalist thuggery be the Triple Entente powers which robbed Germans of their resources and caused inflation to be so high that employers paid their workers in the morning and let them have the day off because, by nightfall, their wages would not buy food.

All the while egging on a Poland (whom they refused to properly arm) to 'Go ahead, pick that fight, we'll back you!'

Well, the Germans tried everything to negotiate an better outcome, including giving the Polese full tax and legal benefits over the city in trade for a no-tariff land corridor to keep their people alive.  And every time, the Poles kicked a little higher.

Until finally, on the eve of war, in 1939, there were 60,000 Germans as the residue of 200,000 raped, robbed, beaten and killed Volksdeutsche, who, as refugees, were living in Danzig and Germany proper.

The Germans rigged a false flag at a border crossing, the world laughed, the Germans used the pretext to invade, the Poles who still thought it was the 1600s, sent Winged Hussar with antitank rifles to stop the Panzers and got gelded for it.

They screamed for help and France and Britain crossed their arms and turned their backs, even though the Ruhr valley was less than 100km across the border and the entire Heer was 200 miles away, stomping the Polish Army.

The wealth class of the French and British, who had also started WWI thinking it would make them richer and happier without those irritating Bosch around, trying to become the industrial leaders of Europe with their hard work ethic, did the same thing to start WWII.

Except then the Russians moved into hold Poland and Hitler turned west to take the Baltics and then Hitler took France and then the Sitzkrieg which was supposed to bankrupt Germany became hotwar so huge that the warmongering morons of the European governments had to beg the Americans to ONCE AGAIN come bail their sorry selves out of a disaster they brought upon themselves.

Yet now, for all the hooplah about how great we all were 'as a team', the post game shakeout of Bretton Woods left Europe so deliberately bombed-flat for want of being 'occupied' that their Colonial Power aggregate super power phase was replaced by utter Marshal Plan dependence upon America, for security (NATO) and debt.

As the U.S., acting as a new minted Imperial Power, took all their resources.  And got rich.

So bad was this that, should you corner a genuine historian, they will tell you that WWII was the ruin of a raped Europe.  Torn apart like a bloody, still breathing, corpse, 'shared' between The Eagle and The Bear.  And they will further tell you that if they had it all to do over again, their response to Poland, in the mid-30s would have been:  ""You have a German problem, go talk to the Germans.  Leave us out of it.""

Ukraine has an EU/America problem.  They should have told NATO to bugger off and talked to the Russians, Slav to Slav.  Rather than accept mediated negotiations on their behalf by powers that want to crush Russia and support Ukraine only so long as the endgame is Western production of Ukrainian petrogas.

Which is looking farther and farther away.

History doesn't 'rhyme' it repeats.  Because the same bloody fingered composers are writing exactly the same symphony as sheet music.

Stop listening to CNN or MSN or whatever propaganda trumpet you use.

Start searching for alternative reporting about losses, consequences and attitudes from the other side-

Yeah, it's really hard to come up with any ""Russian victory"" plan at this point, even with wildly generous assumptions like the ones you listed.

* Russia manages to train newly mobilized troops faster than anyone ever did, so they can reach frontlines on time
* It turns out that the tank junkyards actually had a lot more restorable tanks than we all thought
* Russia buys thousands of old Soviet equipment from Iran, North Korea, Algeria, etc. anyway because even that's not enough
* China fully committing to mass producing tanks, drones, ammo etc. for Russia (China can't build good planes or ships, but that's not really necessary here)
* for a bonus, China somehow manages to go Zero Covid, and not spend next two years in lockdown induced recession 
* Russia magically becomes a lot more competent
* Russians also throw Transnistria under the bus by opening a second front to distract some Ukrainian troops
* and Russians manage to ""convince"" Belarus to join the war for some more distraction

[],False,,Subtleiaint,,,[],,,,text,t2_17vhb4c5,False,False,"There's three ways this war could end; a victory by Russia where they control all of Ukraine with a puppet government installed and all forms of Ukrainian resistance ceasing, a negotiated settlement which sees Ukraine formally cede a certain amount of territory to Russia or Ukraine expelling all Russian Forces from Ukraine and Russia ceasing to contest control of any part.

The first option seems impossible, Russia's initial plans to end the war quickly failed and I see no way they could decisively defeat the Ukrainians using their current tactics. The Russians also seem to have given up on this idea suggesting their ambitions are now just the Donbass and the South coast. We can rule out the war ending this way.

The second option is probably the most likely but depends on two factors; Ukraine's will to keep fighting and how much territory they are willing to cede. Ukraine's position seems to be that their will to keep fighting is absolute and that is backed up by the West who are invested in the defeat of Russia. How much territory they're willing to cede is debatable, the official position is none but there's a decent chance they'd settle for the pre war lines, if this territory wants to be Russian then liberating it may be more trouble than it's worth. For the war to end this way the situation would have to change significantly, Ukraine would have to stop fighting or the Russians would have to be pushed off most of the ground they control, the former will not be for a long time (potentially years) and the latter won't happen in the short term, Russia currently has more combat strength than Ukraine and forcing the Russians to retreat without superior forces will be very hard. 

The third option is Russia's military defeat and depends on two further factors, Russia's ability to wage war and Ukraine's mobilisation. War is incredibly expensive both financially and in terms of men and material and Russia had little ability to replace either at this time. They could fully mobilise but this is even more expensive and politically difficult. Their economic position is also suspect, Russia is not a rich country and Western sanctions and Europe weaning itself off Russian hydrocarbons will hurt over the medium to long term. Put simply Russia can't fight this war for an extended period without suffering significant internal damage and they can't ignore that damage indefinitely. How long they can keep fighting? Impossible to answer but I think they'll be sweating by Christmas at least. 

Ukraine's mobilisation could have a bigger impact,
They could conceivably have a trained force of half a million men equipped by the West in 12 months time by which point Ukraine will have the superior combat power. At that point the war becomes a process of retaking all the territory Russia has captured with the pace dictated by how hard the Russians are willing to fight (I'd guess not very).

Any prediction I make will end up being wrong but my guess is that this war will end next summer with Crimea and the Donbas (pre-war lines) staying under Russian control.",2eb50853b049e60a3ce61c3e219521d8208dfa55,True,False,,,,,0,1651397656,,0,{},i6vzm0p,False,t3_uf9n5g,False,True,t1_i6uo1be,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uf9n5g/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_30_2022/i6vzm0p/,1651397670,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651368856.0,

In particular, key relationships with Japan and Germany are strengthening on win-win, mutual respect grounds. Once the Ukraine story fades, I expect US-India ties to strengthen, too.  
  
I can't see this plan of America giving China suggestions going over well with China. China would prefer to handle its own problems in its own way, and not to be lectured about the way America thinks China should do things.  
  
I don't think further interlinking the economies of China and the US will prevent war. These economies are already strongly linked, and Taiwan is not an economic matter for China.

This I feel is the crux of the issue. China is constantly seen as the enemy, and there is this deep seated misunderstanding about China as a nation. I feel you are one of few fair people that try to participate in the discussion in a reasonable way. Full credit to you. But the bias is so deeply rooted and I can fully understand why Chinese people feel so misunderstood and agitated sometimes. 

Japan and Germany is not China. Japan has been castrated since the world war and are no longer a threat to any sort of Western hegemony. Same with Germany. In fact, I would say Germany is constantly disrespected and being forced to toe certain lines but they simply have no other option. 

China is a different beast. They can and will surpass the US. I would even go as far to say as it is inevitable (Now of course you can disagree with that). The issue is will the US be able to accept and live in a world where China is the dominant power? Or at the very least, can they accept a China that is equal in status? 

The core issue here boils down to 2 positions. 

1. **Self-interest standpoint**. We do not want to concede our top position from a selfish standpoint. ""We want to be the best. It's human nature and everyone wants to be the top dog."" Now we can clearly see why this is a bad view to have because that's what other smaller countries have to accept. The US and China is simply bigger and more powerful and therefore if you're a smaller country, you simply have to accept that you are not the dominant party. Instead of throwing a tantrum and trying to disrupt the world or start a war, you should accept your lower position as a weaker nation, protect your core interest and try to work within this framework. All other countries do this! Malaysia for example is an objectively weaker/smaller country. And as long as their core interest are protected, they understand that China is a dominant force in the region and will try to work within this American/Chinese led framework. It will benefit them and benefit the world. Now if America were to lose it's place as the dominant force, instead of trying to fight and contain this inevitable reality, they should instead focus on making themselves more competitive and work within this framework of co-operation while protecting their core interests. 
2. **Moral Standpoint. ""**China cannot lead the world because they are immoral. It would be a moral issue. We are good and therefore we cannot allow evil to triumph. We would not just be ""better"" leaders but ""morally good"" leaders. Now this is in my point the main excuse and core issue that the west uses to contain China. And in my opinion, very very unfair and dishonest. China has taken huge and immense steps to improve the lives of it's people. They do have respect for human rights and are more than willing to talk and change. In fact, China has in fact changed their behavior many times! They understand that they need to take on more responsibilities as they grow and they can communicate. To paint the Chinese as a nation that is evil and will not listen is an incredibly biased western propaganda. Look at how many countries sign up for the belt and road project. It is so easy for westerners to turn your nose up and say ""Hah! They're just bribing/tricking all the corrupt/stupid leaders"". They're putting them in a trap to control them! We need to stop this evil!"" But don't you see how arrogant and presumptuous such line of thinking is? Other countries aren't stupid. They aren't evil either. They have weighed the pros and cons, and done their own costs benefit analysis and decide to partner up with China.  China is taking massive risks too! Do you think investments are free of risk? And of course when you invest, you expect profits! Do you think China is just demanding and bribing they're way to benefits? 

This is in fact a very western colonial mindset. Invading smaller nations to extract their resources. The Chinese do not think this way!  They believe by offering to build up infrastructure, providing investments, creating jobs will empower the country they are dealing with. In return, they get profits from investments, access to resources. And by empowering a country, they increase wages and creates a market they can sell their goods to! It's a win-win situation! A world led by China isn't so bad after all isn't it? Countries know this and have weighed the benefits and costs. 

By seeking to divide the world and forcing people to pick a side. By constantly seeing this as a zero sum game and trying to contain china will only serve to bring the world backwards. It's inefficient because number 1, you can't contain china in the first place. And number two, you're creating a situation where the world is at war, economies stagnate and yes, people die in wars too. 

I feel the only way we are going to have peace in the world is if Americans accept that you can't be number 1 forever. Work with China. Let them take bigger responsibilities. With great power comes great responsibilities. They would soon need to protect their investments and maintain world order or they would suffer too. So they are gonna have to adapt and constantly change and improve their ways. China is not perfect, but they can change and will change. They are very good at doing that too.",72573f35bd74472d5902ce4b5c034eff945b940f,True,False,,,,,0,1651397210,,0,{},i6vz4a3,False,t3_u7ixz8,False,True,t1_i6umd8d,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u7ixz8/chinas_grand_strategy_dr_mastro_of_stanford/i6vz4a3/,1651397224,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651368410.0,

I ask because since this conflict started, I see claims made where they are the primary source of the information, and people are quick to dismiss the information due to this, and say that believing them at face value would be the same as believing anything the Russian government says at face value.

Although from a gut feel perspective it seems to me that the UKR general staff claims often turn out to be true, however I don't actually know if this is the case. 

Could it be that they are placing an emphasis on actually providing meaningful and somewhat accurate information in to the public sphere in order to bolster their image and reputation to their allies, as opposed to their direct counter part in Russia?

Is it a false dichotomy when people compare the two? 

Do they spread propaganda as much as each other? Or is one a much more reliable disseminator of accurate info?

2. At some point, Ukraine will reach a point when they have enough mobilized troops &amp; Western weaponry to launch a counter-offensive, which will regain some territory. 

3. With both sides exhausted, negotiations will be forced to restart. I believe Ukraine will have a higher ground due to strong support from the West &amp; more sustainable ability to launch further offensives and reclaim back territory: 

Outcome 1 - negotiations succeed. Relative ""peace"" is restored but not at Feb 23 borders. Frozen conflict continues for years to come.

That's no longer true. A tank is very complicated and requires materials, components and tooling you won't find elsewhere. What will a tractor factory do about composite armor? 

What about all of the unique electronics? Thermal sights, the fire control computer? The active protection system? Some tanks like the Abrams and T-80 use gas turbines. You can't make those in a traditional engine factory.

* beg for a ceasefire - even if Ukraine accepts, zero chance Ukraine would accept continued occupation of Donbas once Russian army collapses; but maybe Ukraine will decide Crimea is too hard to liberate, so Russia holds onto something
* keep fighting with what's left and lose everything because Putin is an idiot
* somehow try to drastically reduce intensity of the fighting to hold onto some of the occupied lands - they already did that reduction, the whole Northern front collapse bought them a few extra months, Russian daily casualties were much higher back then; but it's difficult to do this if Ukraine won't cooperate with deescalation; best thing Russia could do to make this happen is withdraw from Kherson and blow up every bridge on their way, but that would be a huge political loss
* just go full Islamic State, mobilize million people, put them in shitty technicals and #yolo to their death - it's stupid, but Russia can do that
* get someone to help them - Iran or North Korea or Algeria or whatnot to sell them a few thousands of old Soviet tanks, that would buy them a few more months; so far nobody is really terribly interested in helping Russia beyond buying their oil at a discount

[],False,,bleepblopbloopy,,,[],,,,text,t2_4lu6l,False,False,"Western artillery surging into Ukraine will reshape war with Russia

The Western artillery flooding into Ukraine will alter the war with Russia, setting off a bloody battle of wits backed by long-range weapons and forcing both sides to grow more nimble if they hope to avoid significant fatalities as fighting intensifies in the east, U.S. officials and military analysts predict.

The expanded artillery battle follows Russia’s failed effort to rapidly seize Ukraine’s major population centers, including the capital, Kyiv. It comes as the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky and his Western benefactors brace for what is expected to be a grinding campaign in the Donbas region. The conflict there is expected to showcase the long-range cannons that are a centerpiece of Russia’s arsenal, weaponry already used to devastating effect in places such as Mariupol, a southern port city that has been pulverized by unrelenting bombardment.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, speaking alongside his Canadian counterpart at the Pentagon on Thursday, said long-range artillery will prove “decisive” in the next phase of the war. The Biden administration, which along with Canada is training small numbers of Ukrainian troops how to operate the dozens of 155 mm howitzers that both countries have pledged to provide, is expected to approve the transfer of even more artillery to Ukraine in the coming days, Austin said.

President Biden said he told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on April 13 that he is authorizing $800 million more in security assistance. (Video: Reuters)
Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin pushes hard on Ukraine — but quietly

The U.S. and Canadian howitzers bound for Ukraine are towed on trailers, while those pledged by France — systems known as self-propelled Caesar howitzers — fire the same 155 mm explosive rounds, but from the back of a truck chassis.

The United States alone already has promised Zelensky nearly 190,000 artillery rounds, plus 90 howitzers to fire them. As of Thursday, more than half had arrived in Ukraine, said a senior U.S. defense official who, like some others, spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the administration.

A new $33 billion request to Congress for additional Ukraine aid includes proposed funding for “longer-range artillery of a heavier caliber,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken told lawmakers on Capitol Hill, though he stopped short of identifying which specific systems are under consideration. Other allies, such as Britain and Sweden, also could send artillery, analysts said.

Ukraine uses Soviet-era weapons against Russia

To date, Russia and Ukraine have traded fire using some of the same systems, including the powerful 300 mm Smerch multiple-launch rocket system, which can shoot rounds some 55 miles, and aging 122 mm howitzers first fielded in the 1960s. The introduction of various Western artillery pieces is expected to accelerate a tactical shift by both sides to employ what is known as counter-battery fire, in which military forces seek out their enemy’s artillery, determine its location and attack, analysts said.

“You’re trying to find, fix and finish,” said **George Flynn, a retired three-star Marine general and former artillery officer.** “You want to find the enemy howitzers. You want to fix their position. And then you want to finish them off. That’s the essence of targeting.”

After an artillery unit attacks an adversary, it needs to keep moving, Flynn said. “Once you get into a counter-battery fight, it’s shoot and scoot,” he added. “You don’t stick around and let yourself get targeted.”

Ukraine’s ability to target Russian artillery units is especially important, analysts say, because of the Kremlin’s demonstrated willingness to lob round after round into cities and towns, destroying civilian homes and infrastructure. “Just the existence” of more Ukrainian artillery units performing counter-battery fire will degrade Russia’s ability to “sit there, pile up ammo and go to town,” said **Scott Boston, a former U.S. Army field artillery officer who studies the Russian military for the Rand Corp.**

“The problem” that Ukraine and its Western allies would “like to impose on the Russians,” he said, “is for them to never have confidence that a headquarters, or a key ammunition dump, or an important cluster of firing platforms, can ever be stationary for very long.”

The Pentagon on Friday assessed that Russia has not been as effective as it would like at using long-range artillery. A senior defense official noted that, as the West continues to send so much artillery to Ukraine, “this could become a bit of a gun battle.”

Artillery units often disguise themselves with camouflage or other forms of cover, and it can require a mixture of intelligence, unmanned aircraft and radar to spot them. The West is providing Ukraine with drones and counter-battery radar to do just that.

What difference could artillery make?

The greater the range of artillery, the more that adversaries must consider how to position themselves on the battlefield.

With a 30 miles range artillery, this would be the scopes from the border and controlled areas for Russian and Ukranian army

Zelensky also has requested some form of multiple-launch rocket artillery, such as the highly accurate M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, known as HIMARS, that is used by the U.S. Army and Marine Corps. Such weapons launch rounds quickly, which is useful in firing on enemy artillery forces before they reposition, said **Mark Cancian, a retired Marine Corps colonel who studies the war for the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.**

Cancian, a former artillery officer, said that there “will be a lot of pressure to provide” HIMARS in the coming days and that he would not be surprised to see the United States begin supplying it soon. Another type of multiple-launch rocket system, such as the M270 operated by the U.S. Army, also could be sent, he surmised. The HIMARS is newer and moves about the battlefield more freely, while the M270 carries more rockets.

“I think there will be a lot of pressure to provide that, and since we seem to be announcing an aid package a week, I wouldn’t be surprised to see HIMARS next week or the week after,” Cancian said.

Ukrainian officials also have sought more self-propelled howitzers rather than towed weapons such as the M777. A Ukrainian official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the issue is sensitive, said that while it appears easier to perform maintenance on and find parts for the M777 howitzer, it is more vulnerable to Russian counter-battery fire than self-propelled howitzers, like the Army’s M109 Paladin.

Cancian said he would be watching to see whether advanced, highly accurate 155 mm Excalibur rounds make it to Ukraine. The weapons are guided by GPS and designed to fly up to 25 miles, according to Raytheon, the Excalibur’s manufacturer. The Pentagon has declined to specify what types of artillery rounds are being sent.

The shipping of Western artillery into Ukraine is important partly because there are few places where Ukraine can find replacement rounds for its Soviet-era systems, said **Sam Cranny-Evans, an analyst at the Royal United Services Institute in London.** Poland, Bulgaria and a few other NATO allies produce them, but many more countries produce ammunition for Western weapons.

Lethal darts were fired into a Ukrainian neighborhood by the thousands

While the West has promised tens of thousands of artillery rounds to Ukraine, they may be depleted quickly, Cranny-Evans said, requiring defense contractors to ramp up production. Russia also has a significant advantage in the number of artillery pieces it possesses, and it’s unclear how many of Ukraine’s legacy systems are still operational or how much ammunition is available for them, he added.

Russian forces are using artillery to extricate themselves from Ukrainian ambushes and inflict fatalities as well as to avoid having to go “into the teeth of these very high-end Western weapons,” including Javelin and NLAW anti-armor missiles, that already have destroyed some Russian units, Cranny-Evans said.

“They’re just going to sit back and let their long-range assets do the work because they don’t have the manpower to waste,” he said.

Canadian Defense Minister Anita Anand said in an interview that there is a role for collaboration among Western countries in providing weapons to Ukraine that are “consistent and interchangeable,” allowing Ukraine to learn the systems and maintain them when they are damaged.

“The M777s are a perfect example of the way in which allied countries with that capability can band together and respond to a desperate need that Ukraine has,” she said. “And that’s a model that we’ll continue to utilize going forward.”

The use of artillery and other weapons has been complementary in Ukraine and will continue to be, Boston said.

“If you do a good job of bottling someone up, then they’re going to be way more vulnerable to artillery than if they were dispersed and in cover,” he said. “If the Russians don’t have confidence that they can disperse because they’re going to get picked off by Javelin teams, then they might be bunching for security against that — and then be more vulnerable against artillery.”",3e33830562e1553687a4ea7adb5f5d15f32b3324,True,False,,,,,0,1651366340,,0,{},i6uqf88,False,t3_uf9n5g,False,True,t3_uf9n5g,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uf9n5g/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_30_2022/i6uqf88/,1651366355,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651337540.0,

I assure you, I didn't invent the concept of a [de facto state](https://academic.oup.com/isq/article/61/2/337/3078982). The progression to full statehood often isn't bright line.

&gt; And if push comes to shove and Taiwan is treated as a state, then you would have broken international law. So if you don't respect international laws then might as well have no laws. Or does international law only apply when it suits one party?

Which international law would US recognition of Taiwan break?

Of course, I'm not all that excited about international law. As mentioned, I'm a realist. I expect that states will follow laws when it serves their interests. The most I can say about international law is that you can bend the interests of nations a bit with them. When core national interests are involved, though, states will not be stopped by laws.

&gt; China: ""Okay Okay shut up. Fine, Russia is a little bitch.""

No, I've never seen this happen.

America wants to hold the status quo, which means tiptoeing around the island [like this](https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/16/politics/biden-china-taiwan/index.html). In general, American Presidents hate talking about Taiwan. Every few years, someone screws up threading the needle and we have a few news cycles of Chinese politicians being mad and American politicians trying to fix things. Even Trump, who was as anti-China as Presidents come, mended fences on Taiwan.

For their part, China knows America isn't giving them Taiwan, and it's not worth disrespecting Russia to get America to shut up about whatever Chinese business wants to complain about this week.

&gt;Instead of trying to contain China, they should seek co-operation and increase globalization and partnerships. They should offer mutual respect and win-win situations. Instead of using China's problems as a bargaining chip or an extra stick to hit it with, give them suggestions. Talk to them. Invite them to join global efforts. The only way to prevent war is to further interlink the economies and partnerships.

America is seeking cooperation and partnership with many nations today. In particular, key relationships with Japan and Germany are strengthening on win-win, mutual respect grounds. Once the Ukraine story fades, I expect US-India ties to strengthen, too. 

I can't see this plan of America giving China suggestions going over well with China. China would prefer to handle its own problems in its own way, and not to be lectured about the way America thinks China should do things.

I don't think further interlinking the economies of China and the US will prevent war.

[],False,,TheHuscarl,,,[],,,,text,t2_amv0e,False,False,"A couple of pushbacks on this (and don't get me wrong, I think the threat of nuclear war is very dangerous and arguably quite high right now).  


1. Radchenko is assuming Putin is operating in a vacuum. I do not think that is true. He is, as far as we aware, not solely capable of launching a nuclear apocalypse or even a tactical nuclear weapon. Furthermore, he is obligated to his vassals and his political backers. He may be the king, so to speak, but he is not immune to their interests. Currently they are rallying to him because he seems like the best option. If he tries to kill the entire world to save himself? Hard to say, but I'd like to imagine many Russian leaders do not wish to kill themselves for Putin. No doubt he's been a useful leader, but if he asked the siloviki to all go home, kill their families, and then kill themselves, I'm not sure they would follow.
2. I think that is entirely possible for Putin to end this war and remain in power. It's interesting that we essentially establish a strange dichotomy of two Putins. One is so powerful that he can order nuclear war and everyone in Russia will just go along with it. The other is so weak that he can't order the far less suicidal option and cut a peace deal for fear of getting murdered. Which Putin is in charge?
3. Frankly the question of ""personal survival vs nuclear war"" is ridiculous. Putin knows he will not survive a nuclear war. Putin knows that even if he does somehow survive a nuclear war, he will be powerless and legacyless. His children will almost certainly be dead. Many of the siloviki will die. What will he be left with? Are we really to assume that he thinks he'd somehow make it out if the whole world stopped popping off the nukes? Presumably the Russians have to tools and plans to dig out NORAD, if they know that they can do that, they know that we can dig out Putin from whatever hole he's hiding in and we would 100% do so.
4. Re: Western signaling, I think Professor Radchenko is taking a pretty grim view of it. First, we have no idea what's being said behind doors. Second, re: regime change, Biden made one off-the-cuff remark and the US immediately walked it back and basically nobody has said anything like that again since. Haven't even hinted at it. The closest we got is that the Defense Secretary said we wanted to make sure Russia could not do this again, but he was talking militarily, nothing to do with regime change. There has been some alarmist rhetoric from the UK, it was also immediately walked back. The UN Secretary General has met with Putin. The Austrian Chancellor has met with Putin. Putin has been invited to the G20 despite grumbling from the West. Third, the US has made it quite clear that they are providing weapons to preserve an independent, democratic Ukraine and that they believe Putin can end this war whenever he wants. We haven't laid out ultimatums, but it's also not our job too. We've made it clear that Ukraine is in the driver seat to determine their own peace, and peace talks, however ineffective, are still ongoing. The West has not engaged in so-called reciprocal measures outside of the most obvious ones, namely an increase in support post-Bucha (this was a turning point in weapon shipments) and shifting more troops to the East of NATO, which Russia must have known was going to happen unless they were completely thick as a board.
5. Channels have and will remain open. The deconfliction line is open. Russian embassies and NATO embassies are still open. Prisoner swaps are happening. Russia is still working re: the Iran Deal with the US. Russia called in the SARMAT II test and we let them know we cancelled our missile system test. They submitted their START documents. All the old Cold War procedures seem to be functioning just fine and, by any measure, we seem to be willing to at least talk with the Russian government.

I appreciate Radchenko's warnings, but I don't think they're entirely correct. I also don't think anyone in the West is ignoring the nuclear threat here. Let's not act as if the Biden administration is crammed full of hawks. Biden is a dove. The Biden administration took us out of Afghanistan. He's not itching for a war with Russia. He is acutely aware of the dangers of nuclear war, as is Putin, who, despite not experiencing a ""major war"" first hand, grew up and was trained in the Cold War security apparatus of Russia where nukes meant death for everyone and everything.",ae7fc8e179a4a4896b9a5dd5de627b93d063a41a,True,False,,,,,0,1651364114,,0,{},i6um851,False,t3_uf9n5g,False,True,t1_i6ufwdr,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uf9n5g/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_30_2022/i6um851/,1651364129,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651335314.0,
