&gt;  Non-conventional
military crises refers to military crises caused by international terrorism, acts of piracy, proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction and other non-conventional security factors faced in the
contemporary world.

Interesting inclusion of piracy here. Does China foresee piracy as a problem in the future? They've participated in anti-piracy naval operations in the Horn of Africa, and pretty successfully.

&gt; Intentional military crises refer to those caused intentionally; they can be further
divided into war oriented and periphery control. War oriented crises refer to where the party creating the crisis actively ambushes and stirs up a crisis to achieve some political aim, the relevant nation or group has already decided to initiate a war before the crisis began and the crisis is only an excuse.

&gt; Periphery control refers to a situation where the party causing the crisis is intentionally pushing the
confrontation to move towards the edge of war, plotting to force the other side to make concessions,
while they themselves do not wish or are even unwilling to have the crisis spiral out of control.

What this passage means is clear in the context of Taiwan. A reading of their definition of ""intentional crises"" could easily be applied to a Chinese attack on Taiwan, as a situation where ""the party"" (China) stirs up the crisis to achieve the political aim of reunifying Taiwan with the mainland. But the second part offers the political leadership an excuse to attribute responsibility to any crisis to Taiwan's political leadership. China's propagandists will argue that Taiwan's refusal to bow to Chinese demands ""pushes the confrontation towards the edge of war"" and forces China to resort to force to (I'm making up the language here) ""quash independence forces that caused the crisis"".",b6782c590f4b93ea30c27e43837e998b6ad537fb,True,False,,,,,0,1653350153,,0,{},i9qvtlk,False,t3_uwbx9g,False,False,t3_uwbx9g,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uwbx9g/pla_science_of_military_strategy_2020_ed_chapter/i9qvtlk/,1653350164,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653321353.0

[],False,,TermsOfContradiction,,,[],,,,text,t2_4doeu,False,False,"Interesting that it starts off by citing two American authors, and later Nixon. I would not have guessed that. Reading through it seems very lofty and wordy, without actually saying much concrete. It could be a function of Chinese writing style as I have seen this before, but more likely it has to do with the only releasing works that are too nebulous to learn too much of their strategic and operational thinking. 

Not a lot of ideology at all, and several instances of referring to scientific analysis, think tanks, and wargaming.

&gt; Early warning of crises is founded on predictions – employing various methods to constantly acquire relevant intelligence information, implement real-time tracking and monitoring, and using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to conduct scientific analysis and eliminate relatively weak or isolated risk signals in the development of security events, transforming the unexpected into the expected.

&gt; * Nixon once pointed out: “When preparing for battle, I often find that planning is useless, but it is essential to draw up a plan.” Because, “Being confident in a crisis is mostly dependent on preparing enough when making preparations is possible.” The third level is to hold actual combat drills. Actual combat drills are a key part of crisis prevention. To conduct actual combat drills as planned, various methods such as computer simulations, sand table simulations, war games, role-playing simulations, and scenario response training can be used to put personnel at all levels in a crisis simulation environment and continuously improve...

&gt; * Where deterrence cannot bend an enemy, moderate methods of actual combat should be adopted to further deter the enemy, so as to stop a war or prevent the escalation of the crisis with a small battle. It needs to be pointed out that the military cannot sing a one-man show in dealing with military crises, nor can military means be divorced from political struggles, the military must always obey and serve political needs.

""Moderate methods of actual combat should be adopted to further deter the enemy"" is an interesting phrase, and I wonder if it applies to the crisis with India in 2020. 

&gt; * Methods of control refer mainly to resolving the crisis through peaceful means such as negotiation and consultations, while using – with caution – coercive measures such as arms embargoes, economic sanctions, military blockades, or ultimatums to avoid chain reactions or pushing opponents into a corner, which would not pay off. 

&gt; * The United States quickly expanding its anti-terrorism efforts after the “9-11” incident by taking the opportunity to station troops in Central Asia and the Middle East is an example of this. The Chinese government’s decisive decision in December 2008 to send a fleet of remnant naval vessels to perform escort missions in the waters of Somalia is also a successful example of crisis guidance. The third is to shift pressure. With the help of the extraordinary situation brought about by the crisis, a new focus can be formed to redirect political pressure, buoy the morale of the domestic populace, and form a situation of unity and stability.

&gt; * To deal with increasingly diversified, complex, and interconnected military crises, it is necessary to grasp the general trend of world development, find the balance of points of power, and use military crises as an influence on international politics and global governance, as an important way to regulate national interests, especially relations between major powers, and as a common weapon to actively improve the state of affairs.

**Key Takeaways**  
  
Russian nationalist figures (including veterans and military commentators) are increasingly criticizing the failures of Russia’s “special military operation” in Ukraine and are calling for further mobilization that the Kremlin likely remains unwilling and unable to pursue in the short term.  
Russian forces around Izyum increased their tempo of air and artillery strikes and likely intend to attempt to resume stalled offensive operations in the coming days.  
Russian operations to encircle Severodonetsk made minor gains in the past 24 hours, driving north through Zolote. Fighting is ongoing in Lyman (north of Severodonetsk) as Russian forces attempt to cut off Ukrainian supply lines  
Russian forces will likely make further minor gains west of Popasna in the near future but are unlikely to be able to quickly seize Bakhmut.  
The Ukrainian counteroffensive northeast of Kharkiv continues to threaten Russian positions and is forcing Russia to pull units from ongoing offensive operations in eastern Ukraine to shore up their defensive positions near Vovchansk.

**Immediate items to watch**  
  
Russian forces are likely reinforcing their grouping north of Kharkiv City to prevent further advances of the Ukrainian counteroffensive toward the Russian border. Russan forces may commit elements of the 1st Tank Army to Northern Kharkiv in the near future.  
The Russians will continue efforts to encircle Severodonetsk and Lysychansk at least from the south, possibly by focusing on cutting off the last highway connecting Severodonetsk-Lysychansk with the rest of Ukraine.  
Russian forces in Mariupol will likely shift their focus to occupational control of the city as the siege of Azovstal has concluded.  
Russian forces are likely preparing for Ukrainian counteroffensives and settling in for protracted operations in southern Ukraine.",b492722ecb5326b4e485bf7d20b2f24f46fa3d1f,True,False,,,,,0,1653349688,,0,{},i9quvoy,False,t3_uvykcn,False,True,t3_uvykcn,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uvykcn/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_23_2022/i9quvoy/,1653349705,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653320888.0

[],False,,SmirkingImperialist,,,[],,,,text,t2_27pmqe,False,False,"The problem with reports by SIGAR is that it views the Afghan government and Army from the organisational structure and culture of the USA's government and Army. The Afghan government, mind you, is more centralised than the American federal government while Afghanistan is perhaps one of the most decentralised place on Earth. SIGAR analysis is technically correct, but reading it provides you no way out on what could have been done, the nature of the problem, and how to do better next time. For example, if SIGAR finds that:

&gt;single most important factor in the ANDSF’s collapse in August 2021 was the U.S. decision to withdraw military forces and contractors from Afghanistan  
&gt;  
&gt;The ANDSF had long relied on the U.S. military’s presence to protect against large-scale ANDSF losses, and Afghan troops saw the United States as a means of holding their government accountable for paying their salaries.   
&gt;  
&gt;the United States dramatically reduced a critical force multiplier: U.S. airstrikes.

Then the solution is staying there forever, not as a 30,000-strong United States Force Korea, Japan, or Europe where service members frequently marrying local women and living a peaceful existence, but as active combatants, then this is not sustainable.

Personally, I found Stephen Biddle provide better answers, in a [longer presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1Nx9J8EIeI), and a [shorter lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWfnJAYXHhM). What is the central problem? Afghanistan, like many other places on Earth, is a weakly institutionalised state where they can't have a system to adjudicate and enforce judicial decision on armed elites. This means that armed elites negotiate by fighting and the primary job of the government of Afghanistan was to balance and keep the different armed elites happy by funneling the corruption money around and not fighting the Taliban. In this context, the US Army and Air Force is the extra muscles that the Afghan government can use to go the extra mile for these ""negotiations"". Nevertheless, the Afghan Government was never strong enough to actually defeat all of these warlords anyway, even with the US Army and Air Force help, and they have been on a slow but steady decline long before the withdrawal agreement was even discussed.

From the beginning, there was only one way out: a negotiated settlement with the Taliban where the Taliban would be legitimised under certain conditions: cutting off of their relationship with Al-Qaeda, for example, in return for international aid and development money. That would not have given the Americans everything they wished for, like a democratic and prosperous Afghanistan free of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, but it would have been more than what the Americans have now. If Americans really really wanted the maximalist goals, they should have gone all-in and flood Afghanistan with at least a half a million and occupy it for 60 years.",50b060a76a331f3c65798631260cd5c448a5a0c7,True,False,,,,,0,1653347166,,0,{},i9qps15,False,t3_uvzvzw,False,False,t3_uvzvzw,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uvzvzw/collapse_of_the_afghan_national_defense_and/i9qps15/,1653347177,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653318366.0

We empowered horrific warlords who the local populations hated and in many ways rowed back on the very basic norms and security that had led to people *welcoming* the taliban in the first place.

2. Given that the ultimate aim was nationwide social engineering it was doomed to failure given the above disconnect. You cannot influence people who don't know or care who you are.

3. Afghanistan is a large poor country with a badly educated population. In what world would a doctrine dependent on Air power ever be viable without it being funded from elsewhere? Their entire GDP is $20bn ffs. Crafting their military in the US' image was a ludicrous idea and shows just how detached those in charge were from the realities.

4. Even if they could miraculously keep everything funded, maintain morale and there wasn't rampant corruption, we found out that the entire air force for example were reliant on US military contractors. We may have trained the pilots, but we didn't train the maintenance crews to keep the planes in the air. The second the US pulled out the contractors the entire afghan airforce was grounded.

The best bet we had for any sort of nation-building was to build a nation that *the people could understand* and wasn't entirely alien to them. That means a nation built on Sharia law.

A lot of the fighting around Kyiv, though not all of it, was maneuver warfare, performing an active defense, where the UA forces often had the freedom and initiative to avoid hard points, hit soft points, stick and move. The Russians were often incredibly dispersed, were still unfucking their combined arms and fires SOPs and TTPs, and were often clueless. While there were less UA troops actively prepared or well armed, especially, reservists, TDF, and various hastily raised militia, there were only a few locations where they were forced to fight a positional battle that they had limited freedom of movement and faced the full power of the Russian military in terms of ISR and heavy fires coupled with successful combined arms attacks. Because Kyiv was so important and the early month of the war was so touch and go, they had carte blanche in terms of using whatever weapons and equipment were at their disposal, UA general staff were not likely to deny them anything because that was the main effort and Kyiv needed to be held. 

Compare that to the Donbas. Positional war at its worst. You're either stuck in relatively static positions getting regularly hammered by indirect fires as drones look for you overhead, you probably can't take a shot outside without worrying if a drone spots you. Even if you can move around tactically for an active defense, like antiarmor hunter killer teams, ambushes, raids, counterattacks, etc, you won't have much room to maneuver since there just isn't the space. You can't retreat much, a lot of the defensive lines in the salient just don't have the depth where a platoon or company can fall back when they want, I bet that's a decision only a 2-3 star general makes, maybe higher. As the current situation is showing, one unit pulling back too early or disintegrating can trigger a breakthrough, and when that happens a fuck ton of unit commanders are given the old ""hold at all costs"" orders, like the poor bastards who held Popansa till it was effectively flattened, those units must have taken absolutely appalling casualties. When when you get that order the location has umpteenth more value than the life of every single person in your unit, they literally want you to die in place before you even contemplate retreating. It's the next best thing to a death sentence. Resupply that far to the east in the country was likely iffy at best, the stockpiles of their best weaponry probably dried up pretty quickly or had to be ruthlessly rationed, either way the good shit isn't as readily available.

-	Lack of understanding of Afghan tribal politics and culture and mindset (which led to their inability to define a strategy as well as their purging of US trained officers)
-	Attempt to impose US style doctrine and tactics which assumes existence of a professional military and NCO corps and advanced weapons and intel capabilities 

Maybe lack of understanding is too harsh because there was extensive education and experience dealing with that mindset and culture. I was part of a civil affairs type team there just prior to the first surge and we discussed the tribal culture extensively. 

Soi guess I mean more so the lack of realization that so many of the norms and processes the US tried to put in place rest on a fundamental set of assumptions that are significantly different than the assumptions a tribal culture starts from. 

Tribalism is largely born of insecurity due to poverty, violence, etc and leads to a machismo type culture to signal to others that you / your family / your tribe are not weak and not to be messed with. It's not that dissimilar in ways to urban ghetto type environments or rural redneck environments. 

But in the US there are at least pathways to move beyond those environments and into professional life including the professional military. That doesn't exist in Afghanistan where everything is very much on the tribal / family nepotism type foundation. 

Trying to teach combined arms tactics to a group that doesn't even trust the unit next to them because they are from a different tribe is futile. Let alone that they didn't have the equipment and capabilities needed.

Plus as a cultural norm many of them were very isolated and wary of outsiders, and many just didn't care at all because they only cared about their own family and village and tribe and had no concept of national identity.",8e30129e822c34cb66dc60a74304a9afbfe0c8a6,True,False,,,,,0,1653343377,,0,{},i9qhuun,False,t3_uvzvzw,False,True,t3_uvzvzw,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uvzvzw/collapse_of_the_afghan_national_defense_and/i9qhuun/,1653343389,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653314577.0

&gt; Taiwanese immigrants in the United States are distinct in two ways: their size is substantial, and their socioeconomic status is remarkably high. According to the 2010 US Census, the 358,460 Taiwanese immigrants rank as the 23rd largest immigrant group. 

&gt; In terms of socioeconomic status, Taiwanese immigrants have notably high educational and income levels. Over 70% of Taiwanese immigrants hold a bachelor’s degree. This percentage is twice that of the general U.S. population and greater than all immigrant groups from Asia, which tends to be more highly educated, other than India. As far as income is concerned, the 2017 American Community Survey shows the household income of Taiwanese Americans (which includes both immigrants and the native-born) to be $99,257. This number ranked only below Indian Americans across all ethnic groups and far exceeded the median income of all US households at $60,336.

To summarize the article, it looks like a lot of Taiwanese emigration happened in the 70s, and various other factors contributed to specifically highly educated people leaving, but its slowed down a fair amount in recent years, thought it has by no means stopped.

You aren't going to drop heavy equipment in the first wave, even if you are doing a classic WW2-style formation drop of hundreds/thousands of paratroopers like the US did at Bashur airport in 2003. You might end up handing the enemy some IFVs or crushing some of your own troops (it's hard to dodge a falling tank when you are trying to corral a parachute tied to your back). They're also super vulnerable to ground fire as they descend, as is the plane during the drop itself, so you're not going to drop them without securing the area first. Meaning there's no advantage in terms of getting them on the ground and fighting quickly. 

Heavy equipment also gets dropped from super low altitude (hence the risk to the plane), so when you're dropping on an intact airfield you might as well land because it's much safer and then you can extract wounded/prisoners too. The only advantage of airdrop in this case would be that you can turn the plane around a bit quicker at the DZ, but only by a few minutes because fundamentally all you're doing is rolling shit out the back of the plane either way. It's just a matter of whether you slow down to 0 knots at 0 feet AGL for a minute or 120 knots at 400 feet AGL for 30 seconds.

We expected a slow withdrawal as ANSF lost control of the outlying provinces they and we knew they couldn't control, at which point they'd fall back to the internal parts of Afghanistan, especially those traditionally loyal to the ethnic groups most represented by the GoA, with Kabul eventually falling when its lines of communication were cut, but with the capital moved elsewhere in Afghanistan. Basically, they'd keep most of [what's not brown in this map](https://external-preview.redd.it/qPmomCjKC-ZgPdvM1VPiFulb6iksrohYYdXJVb3Iwts.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=8609bf1f2c9993737c5f541ba96c8cd192c4dcd2). 

We knew the ANA would desert in droves (nothing new there), but the Commandos were expected to fight hard and long, and perform a delay operation so the above could be carried out. The big question was how much weapons, supplies, and funding we'd give them after we left, but that was never decided. That involved somebody actually contemplating those issues, creating a plan, sharing it to key individuals involved in it's execution, etc. But none of that was done, as far as I know not a single contingency plan was even created let alone executed. Simply put, Biden said pull out US forces and we left. We didn't tell the Afghans beforehand, or our NATO allies, or anyone else. Everyone in DOD recommended against that option, it was done against their protests.

By pulling out without warning, overnight the ANSF lost the ability to resupply, move, and conduct CAS because they were still so reliant on the US to help with some close air support, planning, maintenance, logistics. Without the contractors who rushed to leave (we didn't tell them either), the Afghan Air Force was basically grounded. 

Afghan troops following the existing strategy we followed before giving it to them still had their forces dispersed everywhere in the rural areas, some in the provincial capitals, others in isolated platoon and company COPs as branches of battalion sized FOBs in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, all of them as utterly reliant on air support as we were when we were there, since ground transportation meant shitty roads easily blocked, ambushed, or mined with IEDs. Without air they didn't get resupplied, didn't have their casualties evacuated, couldn't retreat when their ground lines were cut with roadblocks they couldn't break through. Dead meat.

The Taliban offered them ridiculously awesome terms, surrender, disarm, go home, and they'd be fools not to take it. Most did.

As word of that got out, made worse by an info vacuum since they were also largely reliant on a military grade communications system we basically ran for them that was also pulled without warning, that caused panic. Units surrendered enmass, and when it became clear to the ruling elite that they were doomed, most left Afghanistan for various international bolt holes. As soon as that happened and the top chain of command collapsed, there wasn't even anyone left in positions to fix anything or give proper orders, and that was that. Then it was every man for himself.

That chaos triggered a massive crisis because the US still had tens of thousands of citizens (contractors, working in NGOs, etc) who hadn't been warned, as well as many Afghans we had promised over the years to evacuate if the country collapsed (they were dead meat if they stayed). That required Biden to order US troops back into Afghanistan to perform a Noncombatant Evacuation Operation (NEO), holding the Kabul airport as we tried to get our people out. That's when IS-K detonated that massive suicide IED attack that killed a full squad of Marines plus a shitton of Afghans. 

Also, because we didn't plan anything, overnight the Taliban became one of the better armed militaries overnight.

A worn out barrel will be less accurate than a brand new barrel. Artillery pieces that have a higher rate of fire tend to need a new barrel more often than those with lower rates of fire. 

The United States when it comes to munitions and artillery focus more on accuracy and precision to neutralize the enemy swiftly and with lower collateral damage. In other words, slow is smooth and smooth is fast.

Russian doctrine is a bit different. A faster sustained rate of fire as well as the heavy presence of MRLS indicate a different doctrine. To put it simply, volume of fire is more important than accuracy. Even if the precision is around a quarter of a kilometer (That is a hypothetical number), it doesn’t matter if you can saturate the target with munitions.

Drones can fulfill many roles, surveillance, target designator, precision munition, flying weapons platform, et cetera. However, drones that have VTOL, STOL, or STOVL capability on unimproved surfaces  or airstrips should be prioritized. An aircraft is easier to strike while its on the ground and there’s a limited amount of paved airfields, let alone ones that aren’t damaged or cratered.

However, more medium range and some short-rang SAMs would also be beneficial. The S-300s might as well be glued to a position and it would seem that MANPADs struggle against higher speed opponents as most of the reported MANPAD kills are helicopters and drones. I had more detail on this but the others already got the point through.

While I had a more in depth rant about the Stinger, that got lost when I accidentally flicked the screen. So I’ll give the basics. 

When using the FIM-92 Stinger, the soldier after installing the Battery Coolant Unit (BCU) must first acquire a lock on the tango within 45 seconds, as that is how long the battery lasts. Then the soldier elevates the Stinger after uncaging the missile’s seeker. When the Stinger is “caged”, this means the missile’s seeker is slaved to the targeting system on the launcher itself where the seeker is stuck in one direction. When it is uncaged, then the seeker can move. The reason behind the elevation is to give the missile some altitude during the free fall it experiences between the moment the launch motor detaches from the missile and the moment when the main motor comes on. Afterwards, the missile will hopefully track, target, and impact the aircraft, neutralizing it. 

Now consider the following, the FIM-92E and ostensibly the FIM-92F Stinger has an effective ceiling of 3,800 m and an effective range of 4,800 m. Its max speed is in excess of Mach 2.2, that being 748.7 m/s at sea level conditions. The seeker has the capability to acquire, track, and target an aircraft via IR or UV. The latter is to help with distinguishing between countermeasures and the target aircraft. The missile detonates when it impacts the aircraft or when 17 seconds have passed since launch. 

We will consider the characteristics of the Su-25 and Su-34, both having participated in Russian airstrikes in Ukraine.

The Su-25 has a max speed of 270.8 m/s while the Su-34 has a max speed of 388.9 m/s at sea level and 527.8 m/s at altitude. If we consider a low altitude flight, this confers a couple benefits and disadvantages to the aircraft. The benefits have to do with detectability as it is harder to acquire a target if it is “under” the horizon. To illustrate, suppose a radar mast is on one side of a curve and the aircraft on the other. Radar, infrared radiation, light, ultraviolet radiation can generally be modeled as emanating from the mast in straight velocity vectors. As EM waves can’t travel through the ground very well or at all, there is a blind spot that the radar site can’t see below the vector emanating from the radar mast tangent to the curvature of the ground. 

Increasing the height of the radar mast will help with range, which is why they tend to be high above the ground. However, that is hard to do with a Stinger or any MANPAD for that matter as there would have to be a high platform for the soldier to stand on.

However, the disadvantage is that it is harder to evade the MANPAD. One of the ways pilots can use to defeat a SAM is to quite literally, plunge towards the Earth. The SAM predicts where a aircraft will be when the missile gets there based on the current trajectory of the aircraft. If the predicted location of the aircraft just so happens to be in the ground, the SAM will impact the ground with the aircraft pulling out of the dive. When you are at an extremely low altitude, trying to use this may be able to get the missile to hit the ground but your aircraft would too.

At low altitudes, your options as limited. You can attempt to outrun the missile however, that is unlikely to work. If we consider an aircraft moving along the diameter of the effective range of the aircraft, the Su-25 will take 35.7 seconds to get across while the Su-34 will take 24.7 seconds. The Stinger, 12.8 seconds at max speed. It will be longer due to the initial launch and how missile will bleed speed maneuvering. So, the common way to deal with this is by liberally using chaff and flares like your life depends on it because it does. Then, the pilot may take evasive maneuvers turning hard left or right to either get out of the way of the missile’s seeker or to get the missile to follow the pilot’s maneuver which will bleed the missile’s speed and fuel if done correctly. Of course, it is far from foolproof. But hey, if you survive 17 seconds of heart pumping action you may just survive.

Of course, you can increase the chances of downing the aircraft by using multiple MANPADs. However, due to logistics, an unit only has a limited amount of them. And if you wait to see if the current missile hits, you may be able to squeeze in one more shot if you are lucky and the aircraft takes its sweet time getting outta Dodge. However, that’s the thing. You have one shot. Helicopters and drones won’t be able to perform the maneuvers necessary to evade the MANPAD so they rely on chaff and flare. 

Jets also have another option: staying out of the range of the MANPAD or on the very edge of the MANPAD’s range. While the missile has to be launched from the ground, by the time the missile gets to where the aircraft was, the aircraft may already be outside of the effective range of the MANPAD. And of course, the maneuvers explained previously would have an increased chance of working as by the time the missile gets there, the missile’s ability to maneuver decreases when the motor burns out. 

And there is a way to cheese the seeker, IR or UV. Fly towards the Sun. It’s a source of IR and UV radiation and the MANPAD might acquire the Sun instead of the intended target. 

Medium-range SAMs and even short-range ones would help to alleviate this having larger

Although the amount of jets that Russia is fielding isn’t the most important aspect of the current situation, being able to effectively engage Russian jets would deter further air attacks. More medium-range SAMs or perhaps short-range SAMs would help in this regard.  Ukraine would not gain air superiority from this, but it will ease some pressure. 

However, priority should be given to artillery and counter artillery capability as artillery is one thing Russia won’t run out of any time soon.",2ca6cf3711c1412b8ff3d6a894f705a92ed1aa8a,True,False,,,,,0,1653337320,,0,{},i9q4ccr,False,t3_uvykcn,False,True,t1_i9pad7u,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uvykcn/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_23_2022/i9q4ccr/,1653337339,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653308520.0

In some ways, it would be more worrying to see the Russians start digging in everywhere as that would make a harder nut for the Ukrainians to crack later.",c977c5971491950ed5f8c9fbce7a5287431c18a4,True,False,,,,,0,1653335908,,0,{},i9q1270,False,t3_uvykcn,False,True,t3_uvykcn,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uvykcn/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_23_2022/i9q1270/,1653335928,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653307108.0

I would have also liked to see a more detailed analysis of the nuts and bolts behind the oil refinery distribution and fuel network. It's fine to say ""China has such-and-such total refinery capacity"" and ""China can get such and such quantity of oil via this pipeline"", but what's the capacity to move that oil from those pipelines to the refineries? If it's counting on moving a significant portion of that oil to its current refineries on the coasts, how does that occur, and to what degree does that make transportation of that oil vulnerable to attack? (For that matter, if they're relying on getting that oil to certain refineries, are those refineries themselves still intact? I expect that an Ohio packed full of cruise missiles could make a right mess of a port's oil infrastructure in one big salvo, in a way that would be difficult to defend against...)

That doesn't mean that China would be running on fumes on day 2 of the conflict (like the report says, they have enough domestic production to at least keep the military going), but in the event of an actual war, China would need to rely on a lot of improvisations along those lines, and those would be subject to enemy action too - and when that enemy is us, it can be pretty damn significant.

Strategic good news:

Virtual total collapse of the siege of Kharkiv

A bridgehead across the SD river near Kharkiv

Bilohorivka is the biggest tactical victory for Ukraine (it was an abattoir), but there have been others, some featured in the steady flow of destroyed Russian vehicle footage, some probably unfeatured.

[],False,,elitecommander,,,[],,,,text,t2_7u1jf,False,False,"&gt;That what gets me with ships like LCS, with a tiny crew who does damage control?

LCS takes a different approach to survivability than other surface combatants such as the DDGs, which are supposed to sustain combat operations following battle damage.* Instead, LCS is intended to be *recoverable* following battle damage and be able to return to a safe area under its own power. This is actually an upgrade from the original requirements, which were to prioritize crew survivability over the ship. Effectively this meant that the crew would have time to abandon ship after battle damage, but loss of the ship was considered acceptable.

But this concept drew major complaints from observers, including the entire surface warfare community, so the requirements were shifted from commercial High Speed Naval Craft Rules to Naval Vessel Rules, at an improved ""Level 1+"" rating.

This meant improved compartmentation, shock hardening, and addition of greater capacity to fight fire and flooding. For example, the damage stability requirement is to maintain afloat with three compartment and/or fifteen percent of the ships' overall length flooded—the same as a DDG actually. In effect, the LCS survivability standard is somewhat similar to the *demonstrated* survivability of the *Perry*-class frigates (which, contrary to popular perception, actually underperformed in this area).

Where LCS differs from larger ships is shock hardening and fragmentation protection, which were lessened significantly to try to keep costs down. No one was really confident it was even possible to build to a higher standard and still meet other LCS requirements such as speed.

As for crew size, the Navy actually agreed. They increased the crew size from 78 to 98 on both classes, so the crews would have more bodies for maintenance and damage control. This was a change that had already been accommodated and pre-planned to a degree by the requirements, so it wasn't a huge deal.

There are automated pumps and three redundant fire systems to assist the crew in recovering the ship. Some argue that the automation may be rendered fully or partially inoperable by battle damage. They may be right, but it's basically impossible to tell for certain without that actually happening.

&gt; The oldest and longest running of the United States' deliberately ambiguous policies was whether and how it would defend the Republic of China on Taiwan in the event of an attack by the People's Republic of China (Mainland China). This issue is at the cornerstone of United States–Taiwan relations and a central sticking point in United States–China relations. **This policy was intended to discourage both a unilateral declaration of independence by ROC leaders and an invasion of Taiwan by the PRC.** The United States seemingly abandoned strategic ambiguity in 2001 after then-President George W. Bush stated that he would ""do whatever it takes"" to defend Taiwan.[7] He later used more ambiguous language, stating in 2003 that ""The United States policy is one China"".[8]

&gt; In October 2021, President Biden announced a commitment that the United States would defend Taiwan if attacked by the People's Republic of China.[9] But then the White House quickly clarified: ""The president was not announcing any change in our policy and there is no change in our policy"".[10]

These things are more complicated than just declaring that everyone gets a car like Oprah. I don't know what is the right thing to do, as I do not have a deeper knowledge of each actors potential responses. But I think this statement by POTUS is very similar to the statement that 'Putin must go'. I think that it is possible that he was confused given the dozens of other security guarantees that the US is committed to, the political guys honestly don't follow these things that closely. It is already being clarified and declared that US policy has not changed. 

I do think it is important that everyone knows that the US is *willing* to engage in conflict if it suits our interests, that the intestinal will is there. But it is not always helpful to declare what exactly the US will do in every circumstance.

As I remember from a talk from CSIS one of the former CIA guys was saying that some strategic ambiguity in the Ukraine situation would have been helpful as it would have increased Russia's risk when deciding what to do. Perhaps this is what should have been done in the months leading up to February 24th.

I can see your point, but if there is increased tensions and conflict after his latest statements then POTUS will definitely be criticized for inflaming things with this statement which goes against the carefully crafted policy of ambiguity in place for decades. 

At the end of the day it is not POTUS who is the only actor with agency or a responsibility to peace, Putin made his choice and Xi will make his.

[],False,,BeondTheGrave,,,[],,,,text,t2_4zro2,False,False,"During the late Cold War, the solution to AD generally was nap of the earth tactics. Instead of high and fast like a supersonic bomber, you go in SUPER low. Barely over treetop, dodging hills, and fly full afterburner. When you get to the target you basically pull whichever small maneuver you have to to reach launch parameters, drop ordinance, then turn around and burn home. It’s also why a lot of older (to us) US bombs had high drag and chute retarded packages, making it easier to drop on target while at high speed. The poster child for this kind of strike was the F-111. Fast as fuck, huge payload, and a special ground radar designed to help the pilot pick out the best routes to the target. She was a beast. 

These days the principles are mostly still the same. Anything high can be seen with radar easily. Anything see and in range can be engaged with medium and long range AD. So pilots can’t go high. Down low SHORAD like the Stinger *should* cat hand destroy these aircraft. But MANPADs are really not great against something moving at around Mach 1. They just don’t have a lot of energy because of their small size. The real solution is a SHORAD system like the Gepard or Tunguska. However these platforms run into all the same physical limitations as the MANPAD. If your radar is pointed the right way, no hills or anything obstruct your LOS, and no trees or anything obstruct your LOF, you can engage. But if the radar is pointed the wrong way, the guns are trailed left instead of right, you have trees or houses in the way, the crew has *seconds* to correct their mistake before it doesn’t matter. So a pretty herculean  task. 

Low flying air power is a tough nut. The best solution is to have a well integrated AD network: AWACS and long range search radars combined with MED and SHORAD to maximize the chance that you even at least *see* the strike before it hits. Fighters to intercept inbound or outbound flights. And of course a big volume of fire.

It is a combination of cultural, political and economic integration and growth. It would be especially challenging to create measurements for civilian government success because it would have to be defined first.

The easiest measurements are probably the most basic: security and infrastructure (water, sanitation, roads). 

Security is relatively straight forward to measure - how well do the military and civilian security forces maintain law and order. Even that has some difficulty because defining acceptable levels of violence and crime is a cultural and political issue. Creating security infrastructure so a nation can self-supply and maintain is also probably important and easy to measure.

Infrastructure is easy to measure as well: what conditions roads, water and sewer mains are in have a lot of technical measures. The difficulty there arises from what level of access is acceptable. 

Corruption is usually pointed out as another measure, but corruption stems from culture and economics. Pay well enough and corruption goes down across the board since it becomes less necessary, and punishing larger corruption makes it less worth the risk. 

Which leads us into the economy. Everything above costs money which ultimately to build a (self sustaining) nation requires tax revenue.

That's probably important to look at in the context of corruption for Vietnam and Afghanistan. Both countries had very real threats, Viet Minh Front and the Taliban.

One of the things that the US was criticized for in South Korea was keeping the old leadership around that had ties to the government under Japanese occupation. I even remember a professor talking about this when he was trying to explain (blaming the US in part for the war) for the communist north invading the south after WWII.

At first they did. But after the war, they realized the threat and pressure the government to redistribute land.

&gt;Going to the other extreme was the De-Baathification in Iraq, and it is frequently cited as one of the contributing factors to the post invasion insurgency in Iraq.

The problem with Iraq wasn't the people in the military per se, it was the oligarchs that owned all of useful land and thus drained the economy of productivity via rents. This is the same with most middle eastern countries, and the basis of much of their political instability. 

Same thing with Germany, the Junker class was the problem that lead to the rise of the Nazis. 

Typically what happens is that land ownership becomes concentrated in the hands of a few people. They then drain the economy of all its raw productivity via high rents. This leads to an angry populace that supports some politically extreme movement

They had power before the Taliban. Prior to the Taliban, the country was ruled by war lords, who fought each other after the soviet backed government collapsed. The Taliban was essentially the response to this, and it destroyed/exiled them. After destroying the Taliban, the US brought these war lords back, and they began terrorizing the population.

Exactly how to measure military units on their capabilities is something that is done frequently in professional militaries so I am sure it is something that could be standardized to work across cultures and resources. A professional panel could work out something that could have been applied in different circumstances to measure South Korea infantry the same as Afghan military I am sure. But I do think that military proficiency is only one aspect of many that needs to be closely examined when rebuilding a country.

The report goes into the measuring of the security forces, but it does not go into measuring the rest of the civilian government aspects. The report talks about how these metrics could not accurately gauge the performance of the security forces, and they were frequently changed. This means that you could not go back to 2003 for example to see how the 10th Mountain Division performed in its task to train the Afghans, and compare it to how well the National Guard was performing the same task just a few years later. The report mentions that the 10th Mountain being tasked long term was superior, but if we cannot compare apples to apples then we will not be able to learn anything concrete.

This is staying in the limited scope of the report, however I think that this is part of the problem as the narrow scope of only trying to apply military tools subservient to civilian control was insufficient when the civilian control itself was often part of the problem. For example the civilians did not feel safe from the Taliban and they felt that their civilian government was indifferent and corrupt. But there was not a reproducible set of surveys and polling done to measure these things, so no corrective action could ever be taken. As things deteriorated within the country it could not be seen or measured with anything other than anecdotal reports. So the collapse came as a significant surprise to many that could have done something to prevent it.

This is the portion of the report on metrics in the report, it starts on page 29

*U.S. Metrics Failed to Adequately Assess Critical Performance Outcomes Such as Leadership, Morale, and the Impact of Corruption*

&gt; Assessing the development of Afghan warfighting and security governance capabilities was extraordinarily difficult, a fact which we discussed in our 2017 Reconstructing the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces lessons learned report.349 As shown in Figure 2, since 2005, the military’s system of tracking ANDSF performance metrics changed at least four times.350 For the first decade, metrics focused solely on inputs and outputs, masking performance-degrading factors such as poor leadership and corruption.351 In our 2021 report on monitoring and evaluation, we concluded that each iteration emphasized different inputs, analyzed different levels of command, varied in their thresholds for achieving a given score, and, in many cases, used different words to describe individual rating levels.352 Additionally, in our 2017 report, we determined that the Capability Milestone rating system, a tool used to assess ANDSF capabilities, was both inconsistent and created disincentives for the ANDSF to improve because it meant foregoing greater levels of coalition support.353

&gt; From 2010 through 2013, during the peak of the U.S. and NATO’s military surge, the Commander’s Unit Assessment Tool, a different tool to assess ANDSF capabilities, alone changed its performance measurements four times, making long-term tracking of ANDSF progress impossible.354 Although the United States, NATO, and the Afghan government all agreed that the goal for ANDSF development was to create an independent security force, the highest recorded measurement of performance in April 2010 and August 2011 was “independent with advisors,” a designation which lowered the threshold for success and created a complete disconnect from the agreed-upon desired outcome.355 By October 2010, the lowest level of performance was changed from “ineffective” to “established,” removing any evaluation metric that would assess the performance of as negative.356 As shown in Figure 3, monitoring and evaluation systems in Afghanistan became a tool that the military used to show progress over time, despite the fact that some units in Afghanistan were actually contributing to insecurity in their area.357

&gt; SIGAR’s 20th anniversary report, What We Need to Learn: Lessons from Twenty Years of Afghanistan Reconstruction, noted that in an environment where reliable data were hard to get, U.S. agencies tended to focus on overly simplified metrics—such as whether individuals were paid and structures built—rather than the more challenging issue of assessing programmatic impact within the community or the Afghan government’s ability to sustain initiatives.358 For example, U.S. assessment methodologies failed to capture intangible impacts on force readiness and battlefield performance such as leadership, corruption, malign influence, unit cohesion, and dependency.359 In the anniversary report, we concluded that instead of judging progresses based on comprehensive and steady statistical data and metrics, impact was often “just assumed, supported by tautological arguments, anecdotes, and thin connections between program activities and purported outcomes.”360

&gt; In 2020, we also reported that a senior U.S. official in Washington stated, “It was impossible to create good metrics. We tried using troop numbers trained, violence levels, and control of territory, and none of it painted an accurate picture. At the end of the day, there was nothing for us to latch on to except for number of attacks against civilians, ANDSF, and [coalition partners].”361 Methodologies employed by DOD to assess their own programs were also vulnerable to confirmation bias. Unlike past training validation methods, which required an outside unit to validate, in Afghanistan, the U.S. military used “self-assessment,” in which trainers validated their own training of ANA units.362",86feb0970853898ffae372768f10d21a0b423561,True,False,,,,,0,1653324270,,0,{},i9p9nq5,True,t3_uvzvzw,False,True,t1_i9p0bdg,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uvzvzw/collapse_of_the_afghan_national_defense_and/i9p9nq5/,1653324281,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653295470.0

[],False,,Zhuregin,,,[],,,,text,t2_jzs2u5qq,False,False,"Dreadful article. As u/krakenchaos1 points out it stumbles even in the first sentence, claiming ""The entire PLA military leadership cut their teeth in Russia and adopted Russian military doctrines, concepts and thinking in the early years of the People’s Republic of China (PRC)"". Lin Biao was the *only* major PLA general who studied in Moscow (and then only because he was invalid due to a friendly fire incident for most of WW2). Peng Dehuai visited Moscow with Mao, but *debated* Zhukov over the validity of Soviet doctrine, pointing out the wrong assumptions (namely that the opening phase of the war is important or predictable - both ideas were countered by the USSR's own experience in 1941) and the deficiencies of Soviet forces against Finland. For most of the Cold War, PLA after action reports made trashing Soviet and Soviet-advised armies their main pasttime. In one particularly vicious remark, the PLA assessed the 1973 war to be ""basically a contest between Western and Soviet doctrines"" and predicted a NATO-Soviet war would unfold the same way. The last ""Soviet"" adviser was expelled from the Chinese army in 1934 (and he wasn't even Soviet, but an East German Communist *civilian*). I could go on, but the point is there are probably no two armies more different than the guerrilla-grown, chaos-loving PLA and the methodical Soviet army.

Article goes on to make more absurd claims:

&gt; Equipment homogeneity. China’s modern weaponry, including indigenously produced equipment, is basically the same as Russia’s.

Come on, the planes, guns, and tanks don't even *look* the same.

&gt; China and Russia are traditionally land-centric countries that share a long border and similar geography. There is a convergence of thinking on the roles envisaged for their militaries. Both militaries also originate in similar political systems and socio-political habits.

Besides being nominally Communist there is nothing similar between Russian and Chinese political systems and “socio-political habits”. The Chinese system today is just a modernized copy of the imperial bureaucracy.

&gt; China’s Goldwater-Nichols moment came in 2012 when Xi announced the creation of five Joint Theatre Commands and other groundbreaking directives.

No, it came after Desert Storm in 1991, after which the PLA became obsessed with “informatization”, which included C3, IRSAT,  guided weapons and a drive to automate and simulate everything. Xi’s largely politically motivated reorganizations were trivial in comparison.

&gt; Basic military strategy and doctrine. The fundamental military strategy adopted by both is ‘strategic defense’

As is the case with 80% of armies.

&gt; According to PLA sources, China and Russia have cooperated in safeguarding the international nuclear non-proliferation regime; in promoting denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula; countering terrorism; maintaining cyber security; opposing the militarization of space; and encouraged the cessation of Cold War mindsets in many countries.

I can’t get over how this guy says “according to PLA sources” like he has access to some secret knowledge when all of this is public diplomatic maneuvering. More broadly, having some aligned interests in no way leads to military homogeneity - the partnership between China and the US in the Cold War is all the evidence you need of that.

The rest of the article compares Chinese and Russian reorganization in an almost infantile way. For example the author claims [this](https://merics.org/sites/default/files/2020-09/Organization%20of%20a%20PLA%20Combined%20Arms%20Brigade.png) brigade layout (which he admits is only 1 out of 5 of Chinese CAB types) is “almost identical to the Russian MRB” with no equipment or troop numbers. He similarly posts a map of Chinese and Russian military regions with the refrain that because they both use military districts they must be aligning. Here’s the kicker - he acknowledges that the US also uses theatre command but claims the Chinese model is Russian-influenced because the US is “global”. At no point does it cross this guy’s mind that maybe theatre command is the normal way to organize a large army over an extensive territory, and that Russia, the US, and China could have come up with this idea independently.

&gt; The PLA axed 300,000 personnel, reducing its overall strength to 2 million men.32 Again, this move had parallels in the Russian reforms, which trimmed 200,000 posts from its bloated and inefficient officer corps.

Similarly did it never occur to this author that almost everyone downsized in the past decades?

&gt; Each of the PLA’s CABs has up to four Combined Arms Battalions (CAB) which are similar in structure, equipment, roles and capability to the Russian Brigade Tactical Groups (BTG) which were employed in Ukraine.

No no no. Russian BTGs are designed to act as reconnaissance in force assets for their huge artillery park. Chinese CABATs meanwhile are armed to the teeth with organic fire assets and are meant to win through direct fire and maneuver. They are more different in equipment than design than either is to a US battalion.

&gt; The Russians had overcome early reverses in Afghanistan by replacing fighter aircraft with helicopters as the chosen weapon of war against Afghan militias. The combination of Special Forces and helicopters proved highly successful, as the PLA has realized. These two arms have seen the greatest expansion in their numbers.

PLA SOF have been using helicopters as long as they’ve had them - had nothing to do with Afghanistan.

&gt; In the PLA, however, Special Forces units are under operational level and, in some cases, tactical level control. PLASOF has units in the PLA Ground Forces, the PLAN, PLAAF, the PLA Rocket Forces and the People’s Armed Police.

Here (and when he talks about the creation of theatre commands) the author comes *so close* but misses the obvious. PLA senior leaders are basically “general contractors” who have the freedom to train and command forces as they please as long as they meet certain performance standards. Because of that the PLA can’t possibly have any overall doctrinal alignment with the Russians, not only because Russia represents the opposite mindset but because the PLA has no unified doctrine to begin with.

&gt; The PLA views PLASOF as a key force multiplier in the conduct of missions to achieve political, diplomatic and military objectives in peace and war. This resonates with the tasks and employment of the Spetsnatz of the Russian Special Forces as we have seen in Ukraine and Crimea.

And of course he has to ruin the one good moment he had. Even the least reliable PLA watchers know that every PLA military region has its own SOF, all of which have different missions.

&gt; The PLA’s modern Type 96 (similar to T-72) or the older T-59/ T-62/T-63, or even the ZBD-03/ZBD 04/WZ-551/ WZ-553 series of ICVs, are all of Russian design and focus on better and accurate firepower rather than manoeuvre.

So much to unpack here. First the T-96 is not the PLA’s main tank, second while it used a Russian chassis it used Western and indigenous technology, and third I don’t think anyone would agree with the statement that the T-72 was designed to trade maneuverability for “accurate firepower”.

&gt; The PLA’s ‘Heavy’, ‘Medium’ or ‘Light’ CABs appear to have adopted the doctrine of mechanisation, including reorganisation and equipping norms akin to Russian Mechanised forces.

All major armies today are mechanized what is this even.

&gt; The phenomenal increase in the firepower component, especially Long Range Vectors, Multiple Launch Rocket Systems, Multiple Barrel Rocket Launchers and Drones/UAV, in the Combined Armies and Motorised Brigades seems to suggest that the PLA may be following the Russian model in viewing the deployment of artillery as a “finishing arm” 

Again what? The Russians use artillery for far more than “finishing”, the Chinese increased their firepower because they have more money not because they’re imitating anyone, and they still have far less paper firepower than the Russians per brigade.",7ea80659c3fc7461367d47f5b92545558685dee5,True,False,,,,,0,1653323235,,0,{},i9p75zv,False,t3_uudh65,False,True,t3_uudh65,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uudh65/learning_from_russia_how_china_used_russian/i9p75zv/,1653323248,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653294435.0

The disparity in industrial base between Japan and the US in ww2 was much larger than the disparity between US and China. 

This also downplays how many of the critical battles of the Pacific campaign happened while the US Navy was using arguably inferior equipment and older ships than the Japanese. Certainly other factors of industrialization came into play (the low number of fleet oilers the japanese had was a constraint on their ability to maneuver), but I would argue the Japanese had already lost critical momentum even before the equipment train really got rolling for the US.

I think this speaks more to the length of political will than necessary timelines.  In South Korea, Japan and Germany active hostilities ended in less than a decade, so the subsequent decade(s) of support didn't involve send US soldiers home in body bags as result of combat. 

In Vietnam and Iraq, insurgent fighting forces continued to attack US personnel, with no end is sight, after more than a decade and it seems like is too much for the American polity to stomach.

would be the counter to advanced ATGMs. As far as we know APS has 100%   
success rate.

Russia does have APS, they were actually among the first to have it. What you probably mean is hard kill APS. Russians pioneered that too with Drozd and Arena, only problem is that they seemingly don't work. I'm guessing you're referring to Trophy here, which could work. Emphasis on could, because we haven't seen it against the latest gen ATGMs.

&gt;Armor has been known to be unreliable defense against ATGMs for decades. APS is the solution to that.

Since Trophy only came onto the scene ten years ago, I'm taking this as you saying that ATGMs made armor useless from 1970 to 2010?

&gt;Both have been supplanted by MBTs. I'm not sure why you disbelieve this. The MBT can do everything those vehicles can do and more.

Can you point out the MBT with a 152mm gun? A 380mm gun? 

Why can these be done by artillery, but not 125mm? Why not use 100mm as the cutoff for direct fire? Or 90mm? Or forego direct fire at all and just use autocannons, grenade launchers and RPGs supported by artillery?

Conversely, why did American tank guns develop from 76mm in WW2 to 120mm today? Is this because of infantry support needs? Or to defeat Soviet tanks?

&gt;It was converted after Midway, when Japan lost 6 fleet carriers.

Four.

&gt; They still finished other battleship hulls.

One. Singular. And they finished it in the sense that it was already doing sea trials.

&gt;By providing AA fire and defense against capital ships. You yourself   
said HMS Glorious (not Ark Royal) was sunk by a German battleship   
(battlecruiser). Carriers then were highly vulnerable when to naval   
gunfire.

I used this as an example to show that battleships were useless. This was a case of extreme negligence that should never have happened. The commission concluded that.

&gt;They couldn't rely on distance and planes 100% of the time.

Yes, they could, because they were faster than battleships due to their hull design. Radar made bad weather a non issue anyways.

&gt;They were made obsolete by advanced AShM that made the toughest battleship armor meaningless

Kind of like tanks then?

&gt;But in your attempt at making a point you're rather disingenuously   
leaving out the fact that the IJN was heavily outmatched post-Midway and  
 by Leyte Gulf had barely enough fuel for the action.

The IJN was not at all outmatched post Midway. It was superior to the US Pacific Fleet in every respect, even carriers, albeit only slightly. It was only after mid 1943 that the favor swung heavily towards the US Navy. 

And despite that the Japanese never made use of their twelve battleships. Only two ever fired upon another battleship and in both cases due to lack of air cover. Why didn't they use their seven battleships at Midway to just annihilate the two carriers and zero battleships the Americans had?

Moreover, only four of their twelve battleships could be used as carrier escorts (two after 1942). Isn't this a cornerstone of carrier defense? Shouldn't this make Japanese carriers incredibly vulnerable to American battleships?

Since you like to appeal to authority so much, let's have a look at some numbers, shall we? From 1941 to 1945 the IJN

\- commissioned 15 carriers vs two battleships

\- ordered 16 fleet carriers vs zero battleships

\- converted two of their battleships to makeshift carriers.

The rest of your post seems to be a strange combination of praise for the Hezbollah and disparagement of the Russian Army, all to prove a point. Regardless, you didn't answer the question. How are tanks supposed to be used? 

Let's remember, in WW2, the key innovation was to use tanks independent of infantry. German tanks were moving as armored spearheads. There was no infantry running along. There was also no infantry in trucks riding behind them. Infantry was used to secure the flanks, clear trenches or cross rivers and that's it. 

Of course, this was only possible because the main threat was AT guns and armor actually worked. Matter of fact, that's why armor was developed in the first place (and why light tanks became obsolete).

Nowadays, ATGMs literally outrange tank guns. Even your basic man portable ATGM. Kornets have a range of up to 8km. Are you supposed to recon all infantry in an 8km radius before sending in your tanks?

Not to mention, there is no stopping this.

What got me thinking was the mentioning that the amount of time devoted to develop the Afghan military (20 years) was not enough to make them capable of fighting on their own. A common sentiment that even I have expressed is the that this should have been more than enough time, and it was past time for the US to leave. The report however mentioned that the US had spent more time than this to develop other countries after devastating wars, like South Korea, Japan, Germany, the Philippines etc. And it occured to me that the countries were this process was rushed or received insufficient time like Iraq or Vietnam the efforts ended in outright failure or close to it. 

It would appear that the effort to rebuild a devastated country after a war is something that the US has done several times since the end of WWII. Yet there is no plan or doctrine to follow with a comprehensive plan to accomplish the goal of standing a country back up on its own. Each time the people in charge of reconstruction were having to reinvent the wheel and write their plans as they were performing them. 

An overall doctrine for the US to follow with preset metrics to measure progress would allow any future effort to get rolling immediately without wasting any time. This would also give the new leaders of the country in question to understand what the process is and how long the foreign forces will stick around. The question of US commitment was a major destabilizing factor in Afghanistan and a more steady and predictable approach would appear to have helped. The metrics to measure progress kept changing in Afghanistan as well and to have agreed upon measurements of progress before hand would go a long way to preventing infighting, and keeping everyone on the same page. 

This would of course require that such planning be done not just on the military side, but the civilian as well.

The Taliban’s online propaganda push intensified as its military campaigns gained momentum, particularly in August 2021.256 On Twitter alone, the most-followed Taliban spokesperson bombarded the social media site with triumphant propaganda the week before Kabul fell, and a majority of Zabiullah Mujahid’s tweets benefited from likes and 
retweets in addition to a tactic called “copypasta”—slang for copy-and-pasted identical text tweeted out by other user accounts.257 Many of these copypasta tweets appear to have been artificially generated, but the effect was to extend the Taliban spokesman’s original tweets even further. 


We had found nine factors that contributed to U.S. and Afghan governments’ ineffectiveness and inefficiencies in reconstructing Afghanistan’s entire security sector over the 20-year mission.

* no single country or agency had complete ownership of the ANDSF development; 

* the length of U.S. commitment did not reflect the actual time required to build an entire security sector; 
* advisors were often ill-trained and inexperienced for their mission, and personnel rotations impeded institutional memory; 
* the United States created long-term dependencies by taking over equipment procurement for the ANDSF and providing the ANDSF with advanced equipment it could not independently sustain; 
* during the 2009 to 2014 military surge years, the U.S. military struggled to balance the competing goals of improving security to allow for a U.S. drawdown with developing self-sustaining ANDSF capabilities; 
* U.S. metrics created to measure the development of the ANDSF were insufficient; 
* the U.S. and Afghan governments failed to develop a police force effective at providing justice and responding to criminal activities that plagued the daily lives of Afghan citizens; 
* Afghan government corruption harmed ANDSF capabilities and morale; 
*  Afghan officials lacked ownership of military strategies and access to critically important tracking and accountability systems. 
&gt; * Since 2002, the United States spent approximately $18.6 billion arming and equipping the ANDSF.404 This included roughly 600,000 weapons of all calibers, nearly 300 fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, over 80,000 vehicles of several models, communications equipment, and other advanced material such as night vision goggles and biometric systems.405 The provision of equipment continued until the very end. Information that DOD provided to us shows that from 2018 to the collapse of the ANDSF in 2021, DOD supplied the ANDSF with 6,551 vehicles, 18,956 weapons, 299 night-vision devices, and 84 aircraft.406 As of July 31, 2021, according to DOD, the AAF had 131 available, usable aircraft among the 162 aircraft in its total inventory.407 

&gt; * The U.S. approach to reconstructing the ANDSF lacked the political will to dedicate the time and resources necessary to reconstruct an entire security sector in a war-torn and impoverished country. 

&gt; * In essence, U.S. and Afghan efforts to cultivate an effective and sustainable security sector were likely to fail from the beginning. 

&gt; * Further, the Afghan government’s failure to take ownership of nationwide security through the implementation of an effective national security strategy left a huge void when the U.S. announced its withdrawal plans. 

&gt; * Unless the U.S. government understands and accounts for what went wrong, why it went wrong, and how it went wrong in Afghanistan, it will likely repeat the same mistakes in the next conflict.",4f83c5671a543bf8b2d71eb2b3142de2636a664c,True,False,,,,,0,1653312303,,0,{},i9oili4,True,t3_uvzvzw,False,True,t1_i9oheld,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uvzvzw/collapse_of_the_afghan_national_defense_and/i9oili4/,1653312319,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653283503.0

In the military, all useful info is reported up the chain; that's a requirement, you're even given criteria for exact things and who must be told. Every level from battalion and higher has its own intelligence section with numerous individuals, more of them as each level gets higher, who analyze and try to make sense of the info. Lots of bodies at operations centers staffed 24/7, with actual requirements to provide the info to their chain of command. And even then it often stops flowing, is impeded, or becomes contradictory to the point where fog of war happens.

A spattering of Twitter posts from locals reporting info like ""Russians spotted in x"", or else highly suspect Russian govt claims, or else Ukraine military releases from their MOD, aka sanitized and purposely released by a country practicing extremely strict OPSEC and one of the strongest propaganda campaigns in modern history that for some reason are viewed by many as truthful.

For the ANA, training capacity at the Kabul Military Training Center increased from two to five kandaks (the equivalent of U.S. Army battalions), and in 2007 basic training was reduced from 14 to 10 weeks. ANP training underwent a similarly compressed schedule. In 2005, the U.S. military reported that of Afghanistan’s 34,000 “trained” police officers, only 3,900 had been through the basic 8-week course, while the remainder had attended a 2-week transition course. In contrast, police recruits in the United States receive an average of 21 weeks of basic training, followed by weeks of field mentoring.5 

&gt; * On February 29, 2020, the United States and the Taliban signed a bilateral agreement in Doha, Qatar, stipulating that the United States would withdraw all U.S. military personnel and contractors from Afghanistan. The United States signed the agreement despite the fact that the ANDSF was still dependent on the U.S. military for support. In return, the Taliban promised not to attack the United States or allow attacks from Afghanistan on the United States or its allies, and to enter into intra-Afghan peace negotiations.15 Within only a few months of the signing of the U.S.-Taliban agreement, the Taliban initiated its offensive against the ANDSF, testing the strength and boundaries of the agreement.16 

&gt; * According to ANDSF officials, the U.S.-Taliban agreement was a catalyst for the collapse. Former Afghan 215th Army Corps commander General Sami Sadat told us that the agreement’s psychological impact was so great that the average Afghan soldier switched to survival mode and became susceptible to accepting other offers and deals.40 

&gt; * Most prisoners ignored their signed pledges not to rejoin the fight against government forces and returned to the battlefield as fighters, commanders, and leaders of the Taliban’s shadow government. For example, one former prisoner resumed his old post as Helmand’s shadow deputy governor and in July 2021, led the assault on the provincial capital of Lashkar Gah.47 General Sadat, the commander in charge of Helmand’s defense in 2021, told us that most of the released prisoners were group leaders, commanders, and chiefs. That meant if sent into a province or a village, they could recruit and mobilize their groups quickly.48 Several ex-prisoners confirmed suspicions that the Taliban’s pledge not to redeploy prisoners was a deliberate deception.49 

&gt; * An Afghan soldier told the Associated Press that in one night, the United States lost all the goodwill it generated over 20 years by leaving the way it did—in the night, without telling the Afghan soldiers who were outside patrolling the area.51 

&gt; * The Afghan government read the U.S.-Taliban agreement as the conditions-based peace deal it purported to be, not the calendar-based withdrawal deal that it had become. 

&gt; * Ignoring signals from three consecutive U.S. administrations, Afghan elites convinced themselves that Afghanistan was too strategically important for the United States to leave. One analyst wrote that, beguiled by their own narratives of Afghanistan as the fulcrum of a presumed new Great Game between the United States, China, and Russia, Afghan leaders believed they could entangle the United States in Afghanistan in an open- ended commitment.60 

&gt; * The Afghanistan Analysts Network, an independent policy research organization, wrote, “It is common knowledge in Afghanistan that many fighters only fight as long as they are paid and as long as they believe they can win.”70 Afghanistan’s history is replete with examples of losing Afghan factions changing sides, often multiple times, even in the middle of a battle.71 

&gt; * But the root cause of the morale crisis may have been the lack of ANDSF buy-in with the Afghan central government.75 

&gt; * For some ANDSF members, fighting the Taliban was a paycheck, not a cause worth losing one’s life over. 

&gt; * The removal of most U.S. airstrikes, combined with the ANDSF’s defensive posture, led to more frequent attacks by an emboldened Taliban 

&gt; * The Taliban, however, always had a comparative advantage when it came to morale: it was a volunteer army who fought for religious beliefs, not for pay. In the Taliban’s narrative, the Taliban was resisting foreign occupation, an ideology deeply rooted in Afghan history and tied to Afghan identity. The Taliban’s fight was a holy jihad and its members were liberators fighting a corrupt, abusive government propped up by a foreign military. This narrative proved powerful, despite the Taliban’s own foreign dependencies.88 

&gt; * The Taliban was also more ethnically cohesive, composed of mostly Pashtun men of similar religious education and experience. 

&gt; * By failing to account for the ANDSF’s morale, the U.S. military and intelligence community overestimated how long it would take the ANDSF to collapse.92 

&gt; * Due to the reduced number of airstrikes, the ANDSF was left without a capability that was helping them keep the Taliban at bay. 

&gt; * The U.S.-Taliban agreement introduced tremendous uncertainty into the U.S.-Afghan relationship. Many of its provisions are not public, but are believed to be contained in secret written and verbal agreements between U.S. and Taliban envoys. 

&gt; * The Taliban also exploited the secrecy surrounding the Doha agreement and the diminished U.S. support to the ANDSF in their psychological operations by spreading disinformation about a purported secret arrangement with the United States.114 Jonathan Schroden told us that the misinformation appeared more damaging than what was actually in the agreement.115 

&gt; * Afghan security expert Jon Schroden told us that the United States preferred to make Afghans do things the way the United States would do them, as opposed to building around Afghan human capital, capabilities, or what had worked for them in the past.119 

&gt; * hose who performed poorly on the battlefield moved into the ANDSF’s logistics, human resources, and religious support elements. The Afghans considered these positions easy jobs with opportunities for corruption.124 

&gt; * Yet the ANDSF was not able to overcome its dependency on the United States—one that had become a feature, not a glitch, of the U.S.-Afghan military relationship. At the national level, at least three categories of dependent relationships affected the ANDSF: resource management, maintenance, and military leadership. 

&gt; * Yet a senior Afghan government official claimed that President Ghani was unaware of how dependent the ANDSF was on the United States. That official said that it was not until the final months before the Taliban takeover that President Ghani realized that the United States provided nearly everything except for the men actually doing the fighting. 

&gt; * According to a former acting defense minister, President Ghani reacted to most setbacks by firing someone; his inner circle would then fill the personnel gaps based on connections and loyalties.164 The repeated hiring and firing of leaders not only placed the wrong people in critical positions, it incentivized those in power to prioritize their own positions rather than work in the country’s best interests. 

&gt; * Another Afghan official told us, “The president [was] an academic. [He] would look into [resumes] and judge the commanders and [their] capability based on the schools they went to, or the previous jobs they had...This affected the quality of our commanders extremely negatively, and some people who got the command positions didn’t have the quality for leading men into battle.”187 

&gt; * A former interior minister told us that decisions to reduce checkpoints were often based on political and ethnic, not military, imperatives 

&gt; * The Taliban executed an effective campaign that isolated—both physically and psychologically—ANDSF forces and undermined their willingness to fight. 

&gt; * The scenario was foreseeable: In a January 2021 report, Schroden had estimated that a U.S. withdrawal would erode the ANDSF’s technical advantage, as aircraft became damaged by increasing overuse and cannibalization of technical capabilities. His prediction proved correct. 

&gt; * In some cases, the Taliban would even buy out local forces or offer money and other incentives in exchange for surrender",be3ea99a45a31900fd99f6c8da679f89f8afed96,True,False,,,,,0,1653311697,,0,{},i9oheld,True,t3_uvzvzw,False,True,t1_i9ohdgx,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uvzvzw/collapse_of_the_afghan_national_defense_and/i9oheld/,1653311708,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653282897.0

WHAT SIGAR REVIEWED 

Since 2002, the United States has allocated nearly $90 billion in security sector assistance to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF), with the goal of developing an independent, self-sustaining force capable of combating both internal and external threats. 

Yet, in August 2021, the ANDSF collapsed, paving the way for the Taliban to re-establish control of Afghanistan. The House Oversight and Reform and the House Armed Services Committees have directed SIGAR to examine the factors that contributed to the ANDSF’s collapse, including the underlying factors over the past 20 years that resulted in the underdevelopment of ANDSF military and police capabilities. In addition, both Committees directed SIGAR to provide an accounting of all U.S.-provided equipment to the ANDSF and the status of all U.S.-trained ANDSF personnel. 

The objectives of this interim evaluation were to (1) determine the factors that contributed to the ANDSF’s collapse in August 2021; (2) assess any underlying factors over the 20-year security assistance mission that contributed to the underdevelopment of ANDSF capabilities and readiness; and (3) account for all U.S.- provided ANDSF equipment and U.S.-trained ANDSF personnel, where possible. 

—————————

&gt; * SIGAR found that the single most important factor in the ANDSF’s collapse in August 2021 was the U.S. decision to withdraw military forces and contractors from Afghanistan through signing the U.S.-Taliban agreement in February 2020 under the Trump administration, followed by President Biden’s withdrawal announcement in April 2021. Due to the ANDSF’s dependency on U.S. military forces, these events destroyed ANDSF morale. 

&gt; * The ANDSF had long relied on the U.S. military’s presence to protect against large-scale ANDSF losses, and Afghan troops saw the United States as a means of holding their government accountable for paying their salaries. The U.S.-Taliban agreement made it clear that this was no longer the case, resulting in a sense of abandonment within the ANDSF and the Afghan population. The agreement set in motion a series of events crucial to understanding the ANDSF’s collapse. 

&gt; * First, the United States dramatically reduced a critical force multiplier: U.S. airstrikes. 

&gt; * Limiting airstrikes after the signing of the U.S.-Taliban agreement the following year left the ANDSF without a key advantage in keeping the Taliban at bay. 

&gt; * Next, the ANDSF remained reliant on the U.S. military in part because the United States designed the ANDSF as a mirror image of U.S. forces. This created long-term ANDSF dependencies. The United States created a combined arms military structure that required a high degree of professional military sophistication and leadership. 

&gt; * A critical component of the combined arms military force structure was the Afghan Air Force (AAF), which was the greatest ANDSF advantage over the Taliban. 

&gt; * As a result, ANDSF units complained that they did not have enough ammunition, food, water, or other military equipment to sustain military engagements against the Taliban. 

&gt; * Additionally, the Afghan government failed to develop a national security strategy and plan for nationwide security following the withdrawal of U.S. forces. 

&gt; * Instead, former President Ashraf Ghani frequently changed ANDSF leaders and appointed loyalists, while marginalizing well-trained ANDSF officers aligned with the United States. The constant turnover weakened military chains of command, trust, and morale in the ANDSF. Young, well- trained, educated, and professional ANDSF officers who grew up under U.S. tutelage were marginalized and their ties to the U.S. became a liability. 

&gt; * Meanwhile, the Taliban’s military campaign exploited the ANDSF’s logistical, tactical, and leadership weaknesses. Direct attacks and negotiated surrenders set up a domino effect of one district after another falling to the Taliban. 

&gt; * SIGAR found that no one country or agency had ownership of the ANDSF development mission. 

&gt; * The constant personnel turnover impeded continuity and institutional memory. The result was an uncoordinated approach that plagued the entire mission. 

&gt; * …the length of the U.S. commitment was disconnected from a realistic understanding of the time required to build a self- sustaining security sector—a process that took decades to achieve in South Korea. 

&gt; * Constantly changing and politically driven milestones for U.S. engagement undermined the its ability to set realistic goals for building a capable and self-sustaining military and police force. Further, many of the up-and-coming ANDSF generals had only a decade of experience; most general officers in the U.S. military have twice as much. Adapting a decades-long process to an unrealistically short timeline was reminiscent of the U.S. experiences in Vietnam 

&gt; * …battlefield success was critical to create the conditions necessary to draw down U.S. combat forces. But because U.S. troops were far more effective at fighting, they often led missions or filled critical gaps in missions—providing close air support, airstrikes, medical evacuation, logistics, and intelligence gathering—at the expense of the ANDSF gaining experience fighting on its own. As a result, the Afghan National Army became overly reliant on borrowed capabilities. 

&gt; * Fourth, the United States lacked any real yardstick for measuring the ANDSF’s development. 

&gt; * During the U.S. military surge, measurement methods changed five times, making long-term tracking of ANDSF progress impossible. 

&gt; * SIGAR found that the United States has long struggled to provide an accurate accounting of U.S.-provided equipment and U.S.- trained ANDSF personnel. 

&gt; * In addition, we had identified nine factors that explain why, after 20 years and nearly $90 billion in U.S. security assistance, the ANDSF was ill-prepared to sustain security following a U.S. withdrawal. Specifically, (1) no country or agency had complete ownership of the ANDSF development mission, leading to an uncoordinated approach; (2) the length of the U.S. commitment was disconnected from the reality of the time required to build an entire security sector; (3) the U.S. created long-term dependencies that would require significant time to overcome, such as providing the ANDSF with advanced equipment they could not sustain and leaving them out of the equipping process; (4) the U.S. military, driven by political deadlines, struggled to balance winning battles with letting the ANDSF gain experience by fighting on their own; (5) U.S. metrics created to measure the development of the ANDSF were unable to effectively measure ANDSF capabilities; (6) Afghan corruption harmed ANDSF capabilities and readiness; (7) U.S. control of the battlespace and of key governance systems restricted Afghan ownership of important military and governance systems; and (8) the U.S. and Afghan governments failed to develop a police force effective at providing justice and responsive to criminal activities that plagued the lives of Afghan citizens. 

&gt; * …the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 removed a key resource from the Afghanistan mission: active duty military units to train the Afghan military. Instead, training the Afghan military transitioned to steady rotation of Army National Guard units.2",f9ae85c7abb2514bb61a5e6ea97243773e381d75,True,False,,,,,0,1653311681,,0,{},i9ohdgx,True,t3_uvzvzw,False,True,t3_uvzvzw,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uvzvzw/collapse_of_the_afghan_national_defense_and/i9ohdgx/,1653311694,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653282881.0

Let's take a couple of specific examples here: North and South Korea. North Korea is the classic example of a pariah state that benefits from having nuclear weapons. They're safe because everyone is afraid that if we seriously threaten the Kim regime they might actually use nuclear weapons, forcing us to respond, which they almost certainly wouldn't do otherwise, because it would force us to respond. But in a post-Russian use scenario, there would be a strong possibility that they would use nuclear weapons on South Korea regardless. That would mean that South Korea would want to get nuclear weapons immediately, certainly. But it would also mean that there would be less risk in attempting to remove the current government in North Korea, yes they might use a nuclear weapon, but the world kept going last time that happened, and they might well do it anyway, so maybe it's better to remove the risk.

Again, though, the much much bigger concern would be the normalization of nuclear weapon use. It's been widely understood for many decades that actually using nuclear weapons is a losing move. It might let you take a lot of people with you, you could even try to concoct a scenario where your country might suffer less than others, but ultimately you have to assume that you will lose pretty much everything if you do it. If that's proven not to be the case, then they will be used, frequently. If Russia can get away with it then why wouldn't North Korea use nukes to gain an advantage over South Korea, or China to gain an advantage over Taiwan?

For the article itself, Pakistan is now increasingly becoming a distant second concern compared to China itself, and India's first deployment of S-400 is on the Chinese border.

India has always maintained a varying degree of conventional superiority over Pakistan, so increasing that gap slightly is hardly ""destabilizing"".

Exactly what form that will take who knows, although I suspect vast numbers of UCAVs will be involved which is one factor that will make this different from previous conflicts.

Around 2021 and early this year, prior to outbreak of war in Ukraine the trendy word in ROC military was ""源头打击"" or ""source strike"" which is exactly about ROC preemptive attack when it looks like there's an attack coming from PLA. However since the outbreak of war it seems the US has been pushing hard for ROC to give up this idea [and even trying to restrict their weapon purchase to only asymmetrical warfare weapons.](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2022/05/19/2003778450) How exactly this would affect ROC capability for preemptive attack going forward remains to be seen.

As for PLA, it seems a lot of people, even if they are interested in Taiwan Strait relations don't know much about how PLA is preparing for this. The RoRo ships for example, even though it's shown on national TV in China and hardly a secret is not well known. I feel like in the event of war PLA will be coming out with many such ""tricks"" up their sleeve that weren't actually classified but people just weren't paying attention to.

One I know of is the [J-6 UCAV](https://eurasiantimes.com/china-shows-off-its-fighter-jet-drones-that-can-overwhelm-enemy-defenses-experts-say-again-inspired-by-us-air-force/). These things have been spotted in large numbers in military airfields from satellite photos for a long time and it's been suspected that there's an active program to convert them into kamikazi UCAVs. It wasn't until late last year when ETC showed off a pair of them in public photos that people have come to realize they really do exist. Rumors say the conversion kits cost as little as low 5 digit USD each and you end up with a runway launched anti-radiation cruise missile with a few hundred km range, loitering capability, and loaded with a ton of iron bomb that is nearly indistinguishable on radar screen as manned fighters.

A story I heard about them is the people in charge of these J-6 wanted the huge PLAAF roundels on the wings removed. Their rationale is that if used in war, weather by shot down from air defense or them successfully hitting targets there will be lots of opportunity for Taiwanese media to show photos and video of people standing on the wings and claiming they shot down manned fighters. The argument is after modification these things are really aircraft shaped munitions and not fighters. However the brass overruled them and so you can still see them on those photos.

[],False,,cyprus1962,,,[],,,,text,t2_1tphrd53,False,False,"Thanks for the response. The combination of civil/militia RORO ships with what appears to be a lot of dedicated amphibious fighting vehicles is certainly hair-raising for someone who bought into the narrative that China was both severely lacking sealift capability and doing nothing much about it amidst their otherwise huge naval buildup. It definitely made it seem as if they weren’t taking the idea of an amphibious landing seriously at least in the near to medium term, but it seems increasingly like that was just a false sense of security.

That said, 200 AFVs sitting in a floating box, whether it’s when they’re actually at sea or being offloaded at captured/artificial harbours, sounds like an incredibly juicy and vulnerable target for Taiwanese AShM, submarines, long-range fires and air power. I assume the PLA would be betting on them being able to attrit or suppress ROC sensors and weapons systems *and* achieve air supremacy early on (or at least long enough to finish the sealift), but everything we’ve seen seems to point to that being a pretty big gamble. Even disregarding Russia’s inability to gain air superiority after 80 days of fighting (I find parallels between the current conflict and Taiwan pretty flimsy), even NATO/US experience hasn’t been stellar in totally negating missile threats (the Great SCUD Hunt et al.) I’ve read similar concerns about the difficulty of locating and destroying missile threats from a US perspective (relating to a possible North Korean contingency) even with modern sensors, I assume the PLA would have similar concerns in a Taiwan landing scenario. Although I’ve also heard the PLA has some of the most advanced sensors and integrated information systems in the game right now.

It’s a lot to take in but all in all it still seems like a pretty audacious gamble that could go very wrong very quickly, but I guess that is always how things work.",1f06880442b6c6e49cdad2606e0baad12f804b96,True,False,,,,,0,1653280039,,0,{},i9nbmf3,False,t3_uvb7ex,False,True,t1_i9n8uqi,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uvb7ex/civilian_shipping_and_maritime_militia_the/i9nbmf3/,1653280050,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653251239.0

Against last gen MBTs, yes. Which I said. Russia hasn't deployed its most advanced MBTs to Ukraine, presuming they even exist off paper. Russia doesn't have any armored vehicles in Ukraine with APS, which would be the counter to advanced ATGMs. As far as we know APS has 100% success rate.

&gt; whereas for a tank, armor is supposed to be that protection.

No. That's just wrong. Armor is the *last* resort. Just like body armor on infantry is the last resort.

Armor has been known to be unreliable defense against ATGMs for decades. APS is the solution to that. Even so, there have been documented cases of armor successfully preventing an ATGM from penetrating.

&gt; Artillery can be accurate to within a meter.

In theory, yes. In practice it's never that accurate. And you're forgetting there are a variety of outside factors that can prevent artillery from even being employed. ROE, availability of guns, types of guns, angle, and presence of friendly troops. In Wadi Saluki Israeli artillery refused to fire on the heights because they didn't know if IDF infantry was in the grid.

Additionally, 600 meters is still considered danger close for infantry, further for rocket artillery. And artillery isn't exactly the preferred method for taking out a moving target like an enemy tank or AFV. Direct fire is always superior in that regard.

Artillery is also not efficient for all types of targets. A large apartment building with a sniper or ATGM team in it is not a good target for artillery, especially if ROE limits artillery in an urban environment or if friendlies intermingled would prevent artillery from safely firing.

&gt; And communication happens at light speed.

It absolutely does not. A Forward Observer has to call for fires and follow a pretty strict procedure for calling for support to make sure rounds are delivered accurately. This can also include spotting rounds for dialing in the guns. It's faster than it has been in wars previous but it is not ""light speed"" nor is it as fast as a tank firing on a target directly. And this doesn't even get into what happens if a battery is overwhelmed with requests. You can't rely on that process when you're taking direct fire from the enemy.

&gt; And what's the replacement for a ISU-152? Or a Sturmtiger? 

Both have been supplanted by MBTs. I'm not sure why you disbelieve this. The MBT can do everything those vehicles can do *and more*. An Abrams carries multiple types of rounds for light armor, heavy armor, structures, infantry and even helicopters. British tanks still carry HESH for taking out concrete structures like buildings and bunkers.

MBTs are explicitly general purpose direct fire platforms. They provide all the service those previous generation assault guns and tank destroyers did, and anything they can't do can be done by the above-mentioned accurate artillery and PGMs from air power.

&gt; The penetration of modern shaped charges surpasses the armor of tanks.

Sometimes, yes. Sometimes, no. I already went over examples where it did not happen. ATGMs aren't a magic pill. Generally, modern ATGMs defeat armor. APS is the solution to that.

&gt; I suppose the Japanese Navy also had a surface level understanding when they converted Shinano to a carrier.

It was converted after Midway, when Japan lost 6 fleet carriers. It had been in construction since 1940. Japan is a resource poor country without a strong industrial base. They converted the hull because it was faster and easier than trying to lay a new one and they were desperate. They still finished other battleship hulls.

&gt; An essential piece of the carrier's defense? By providing AA fire?

By providing AA fire and defense against capital ships. You yourself said HMS Glorious (not Ark Royal) was sunk by a German battleship (battlecruiser). Carriers then were highly vulnerable when to naval gunfire. They couldn't rely on distance and planes 100% of the time. Bad weather severely reduced their effectiveness. Their ability relied on early detection which was not 100%. Even in Leyte Gulf the Japanese tricked away the main fleet to get up close to American escort ships, including aircraft carriers. It took torpedoes and naval guns to push them back.

At this point, though, this a huge derailment of the discussion. The fact is battleships were not made obsolete by the aircraft carrier; their role changed. They were made obsolete by advanced AShM that made the toughest battleship armor meaningless, and made EW and interceptors more important than armor and could be mounted to smaller ships. Early detection remains the most important defense a fleet has.

&gt; so according to you they are obsolete

According to every modern navy. Unlike tanks, which are in use with every modern fighting force. Even forces that had planned to retire their tanks changed their minds after getting into combat.

&gt;  So I suppose carrier aircraft have now learned how to correctly bombard a shoreline? 

They still aren't very good at it but the PGMs carried by their planes and support ships are. Even so there is talk about the need to bring shore bombardment back, hence high velocity projectiles and the Marines strapping MLRS systems onto amphibs. The real problem with battleships is that they are massive, expensive vessels with no utility that a smaller vessel can't provide. A smaller ship like a destroyer can carry plenty of missiles at a lower cost and lower investment in personnel.

&gt; How often did Yamato fire her main guns at an enemy battleship? How often did Musashi?

Yamato participated in Leyte Gulf and fired on surface vessels. Musashi was never in gunfire range of surface vessels. But in your attempt at making a point you're rather disingenuously leaving out the fact that the IJN was heavily outmatched post-Midway and by Leyte Gulf had barely enough fuel for the action. After Leyte Gulf Yamato was ordered to beach itself to be an AA platform because there was no fuel left for it to participate in any naval actions. Both ships were sortied numerous times in response to American raids but weren't able to find anything to fight.

Tanks get into scraps all the time, though, even though ATGMs have been around since the '50s.

&gt; you discard this war

No, I explained to you why it's a bad example for your point. Ukraine is getting the top of the line ATGMs for free, as many thousands as they want. No other nation has ever had that kind of deal. It's worth noting this was *not* the case when Russia was preparing their invasion.

Russia, meanwhile, has made every tactical and strategic blunder imaginable.

This doesn't prove that tanks are obsolete. It proves bad tactics gets you killed.

&gt; you use some militants vs the IDF

Hezbollah is a political party and militant group in Lebanon, with representation in the Lebanese Parliament. Their militant wing is trained, funded and armed by the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and has fought in Bosnia and against the IDF multiple times. They used over 20 Kornet missiles, a modern missile in 2006 when the battle occurred, to launch as many as 100 missiles at 24 IDF tanks with every advantage they could ask for. The casualties were relatively low, and several tanks were hit multiple times. One was penetrated and suffered an ammunition fire and went back into action.

&gt; Then, what tactics? Can you please explain what tactics the Russians should use to identify and destroy all potential ATGM armed infantry?

The Russians have basically no combined arms interoperability. They don't have integration between their ground forces, their air forces and their artillery. Low level units don't have the ability to call in artillery or air without difficulty. Their air force doesn't have the experience in large air operations, having only practiced operating in pairs previously. Low flight hours on the part of the VVS means their pilots have to specialize rather than be decently well trained on all types of air operations. Poor logistics means many of their vehicles have been straight abandoned without a fight.

They don't recon areas properly before sending in columns of armor to be picked up by enemy drones and ATGMs like a shooting gallery. They don't properly secure their supply lines to prevent ATGM teams from running wild in their rear. I don't think they have the capability to pursue partisan fighters in their rear areas. A force, no matter how modern, is going to get hammered by ATGMs when they don't recon the area before sending their tanks in. A force is going to get hammered by drones when they don't have air superiority, don't invest in countermeasures and don't adequately erode C3 facilities at the start of their operations. A force that doesn't have secure comms isn't going to win against a force that does.

Ukraine has every force multiplier a nation could ask for: advanced equipment (at no cost to themselves), night vision and thermal optics, secure communications, early warning systems, well trained low level leadership, and the ability to perform air sorties.

This is before getting into a lack of modern optics on Russian vehicles like thermal sights, the lack of night fighting gear for their infantry, the lack of PGMs for CAS.

They don't have control of the air and they don't send in recon units so they can't see the enemy first. They haven't eliminated Ukrainian communications or command networks so they can't prevent themselves from being detected. They send their tanks and AFVs into the open or into cities blindly so they can't keep themselves from being acquired. Their troops aren't well trained on their equipment or tactics and so they can't keep themselves from being hit. They don't have APS systems so they can't keep from being penetrated. Their tanks are designed poorly with ammo around the turret so when penetrated they can't keep their men from getting killed.

I can't name a single thing the Russians have done *right* in this war.",0ee2568b7efc6281647e1f819266293d1578e408,True,False,,,,,0,1653276569,,0,{},i9n5umq,False,t3_uvb8zf,False,True,t1_i9mrwjw,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uvb8zf/a_whole_age_of_warfare_sank_with_the_moskva/i9n5umq/,1653276581,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653247769.0

[],False,,MarshalWillKane,,,[],,,,text,t2_dla6h,False,False,"I heard about this in the news but did not know much more than that, so I found this article that gives some background information. It is amazing that this one system can have such major implications for India with the US, China, Pakistan, and Russia, all at the same time. Apparently it has become a major subject in Indian mass media with lots of misinfo flying around. 

---------------

&gt; * India’s quest for attaining superior military technology has materialized in New Delhi’s purchase of the S-400 air defense system from Russia. 

&gt; * The S-400 has drawn the interest of US allies and adversaries alike.

&gt; * The system is integrated with autonomous detection and targeting systems, launchers, multifunctional radars, and command and control and is equipped with the capability to fire multiple missiles to create a layered defense. Furthermore, it can track 80 targets simultaneously and can be made operational within five minutes.

&gt; * India aims to curtail Pakistan’s capabilities by denying it ingress to the Indian territory in case of an aerial engagement, for which India is augmenting both defensive and offensive capabilities.

&gt; * The former Indian Chief of Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal (ret.) B. S. Dhanoa, in an interview stated that “the purpose of the S-400 missile system and Rafale is to hit Pakistani aircraft inside Pakistani air space and not when they come inside Indian territory.”16

&gt; * The S-400 will alter the minimum deterrence levels, provoking an arms race between the archrivals

&gt; * All these factors add up and compound the threat to the regional peace of South Asia, making it more unstable.

&gt; * India and Pakistan have not engaged in any productive dialogue following an aerial engagement in February 2019, and India’s unilateral action taken in Kashmir by the abrogation of Article 370 has further impaired the already strained relations between the two countries. With the delivery of the S-400 system in late 2021, Indian leadership likely will be even more reluctant to terminate the deadlock in the bilateral relations.

&gt; * Recently, Russian air defense systems have failed to perform optimally, particularly in Syria, Libya, and Armenia.

&gt; * In April 2020, the Syrian military raised concerns over the performance of S-300 air defense system when its radars failed to detect and target Israeli cruise missiles on various occasions.

&gt; * On 28 February, Syria lost three Pantsir-S1 and one Buk-1 air defense systems deployed in Idlib.42 These systems became a target of Turkish drones, which employed electronic warfare to evade the air defense systems. Ironically, the Pantsir-S1 is perceived as one of the most advanced air defense systems in the Russian inventory and is designed specifically for short-range air defense. However, footage showed that the radars of these systems were active before they were hit, which raises concerns over their effectiveness.43

&gt; * The S-400 has not been used by the Russians in Syria to counter Israeli strikes. This development implies that even the Russian operators are aware that, in the likely event that the incoming aerial vehicles are more than the handling capacity of their state-of-the-art air defense system, some of them will go unintercepted, which will raise questions over a system tagged as the world’s best air defense system.

&gt; * The recent Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in late 2020, is another example where the vulnerability of air defenses against drones has been exposed. 

&gt; * Azerbaijan used decoy aircraft in Armenian territory, which were shot at by the deployed air defense systems. This action exposed the locations of those air defense systems, which were then neutralized by drones. Russian air defense systems such as the 2K12 Kub, 9K35 Strela-10, 9K33 Osa, and 2K11 Krug could not intercept a number of drones, which either reached their intended targets or destroyed the air defense system itself. Azerbaijan has also claimed that it destroyed several batteries of the S-300 air defense systems45 and circulated footage in this regard. This is highly concerning, as it suggests that the S-400, which is the successor of S-300, could have similar vulnerabilities.

&gt; * In May 2020, the Libyan army was also successful in destroying nine Russian Pantsir-S1 air defense systems

&gt; * Moreover, air defense systems were more optimal for Cold War–type scenarios, in which the travel time was at least 30 minutes. As far as India and Pakistan are concerned, the proximity would leave very minimal reaction time. 

&gt; * The Indian regime is all set to obtain this technology, despite the fact that the purchase could invoke CAATSA sanctions. However, it is likely that India will be able to get a waiver or some relaxation from the United States, an important strategic partner.

&gt; * The introduction of the S-400 will have significant consequences for regional stability, creating a negative impact on the arms race and vertical proliferation in South Asia.

I'm talking about Berger's planned doctrine of ""send penny packets of Marines to small islands, have them radiate with tons of sensors, but not provide them with any of the tools needed to actually *survive* in such an environment.""

For example, their planned air defense system, the Medium Range Intercept Capability, is a TPS-80 wedded to the Iron Dome interceptor. Great...if your only anticipated threat is short range RAM targets and subsonic cruise missiles. Too bad the Marines plan to put Marines right next to the largest, most capable tactical ballistic missile force on the planet. How ideal!

&gt;In other words, this isn't the LCS all over again. This is simply the last domain of war to fall to drone tech. Naval and air war is already dominated by drones, and its taken longer due to technological limitations for such technology to be applied to ground warfare. Now that we have the tech... we're going to see a massive transformation.

You simply don't understand the core programmatic mistakes of LCS, which weren't technical. Which is weird, because I have already told you this.

LCS's core problems come from its analytical genesis, where vision for requirements and doctrine were written by the CNO without the usual steps of supporting requirements analysis as well as comprehensive and *adversarial* wargaming that would have attempted to find flaws in the concept. Force Design 2030 follows a similar pattern, with vision dictated from the top down, and concerns from others either given bare lip service or dismissed entirely by Berger and his acolytes. Even Berger's own direct predecessor, Robert Neller, who made moves that positioned the Marines in this direction, believes this change is far too much far too fast, as does every other living former Commandant.

To get USMC missiles onto islands where they can do any good in an event of war then the US Navy Seventh Fleet has to run the gauntlet deep into highly contested waters to insert, resupply, move, evacuate every single Marine company. They won't be stealthy, unless there is a super secret plan to insert all Marines and their equipment using stealth amphib ships that don't exist with no plans to exist. Even using long range helicopters only and no LCAC to unload them and their supplies, it means getting and staying well inside First Island Chain range to Mainland China for days. 

And all that assumes the second and third largest nuclear powers can kill each other left and right, sink ships, US can strike PLAN naval bases and missile sites on the mainland at will, and nobody goes nuclear. Because then nobody in America is going to care about any Pacific islands.

I think this is a classic A2AD mission to prevent Chinese expansion into Pacific sea lanes, a mission to happen short of war. The US Navy can't patrol those areas aggressively enough as a show of force to deter Chinese expansion, it's too dangerous they don't have enough ships. Seeing China currently occupy islands with ground forces setting up missiles that expand their strategic reach/control into international waters, someone very important in the US govt decided we should do that too, exactly the same thing. Currently, the Marines weren't set up to do it, they can't mimic what the Chinese did. What Berger is doing changes that. 

But we're still just talking about Wake Island 2.0, platoon and company sized combat outposts in bumfuck Pacific needing to be regularly resupplied, who have organic missiles and ISR they control to theoretically sink PLAN ships if they get in range of their island COPs. They can't stop a hyper velocity cruise missile strike against themselves, can't prevent themselves from starving to death if cut off. But that's not the point. The point is if they take an island, short of war, the PLAN has to stay away from it so an accident doesn't happen and WW3 starts.

I don't even have a problem with Berger changing some of the Marine Corps to do that, but he's changing all of it to go it.

States don't always act rationally. Look at Russia. Oh and the US would be taking that quote into consideration as well. That's why they've never used tactical nukes in combat. Threatening nukes against China seems irrational to me, and not something the US would do. I think that a much more likely US response would be 1. Sanctions, maybe boot China from SWIFT, though I don't know how effective this would be and how much it could backfire. 2. Embargo or blockade. 3. Naval/air defense of Taiwan. Possibly all of the above. Nukes seem to me like something the US wouldn't want to be used by *anyone*.

&gt;Ideally, we maintain perpetual military, economic and technological superiority, but that can't be guaranteed. So as a back up, using existing alliances in key regions, like the first island chain, and nuclear weapons to make it virtually impossible to be displaced from those regions, is a needed back up plan.

I agree that superiority can't be guaranteed perpetually, but to the second part, why tactical nukes instead of conventional weapons? If they are both effective but one is more likely to cause an escalation.

&gt;During the first half of the Cold War, you could see mushroom clouds from nuclear tests in Las Vegas (and those where strategic weapons). Fallout is a concern, but it is often exaggerated in pop culture. If nukes blanketed hundreds of square miles in lethal fallout, all of the south west would be uninhabitable.

I'm reading the [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Test_Site), a relevant part:

*Westerly winds routinely carried the fallout of from above-ground nuclear testing directly through St. George, Utah and southern Utah. Increases in cancers, such as leukemia, lymphoma, thyroid cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, bone cancer, brain tumors, and gastrointestinal tract cancers, were reported from the mid-1950s onward*

St. George is roughly 230km/143mi from the test site. Taiwan is a tiny and densely populated country, with most of its population living in the western half. Using nukes here is very dangerous for the Taiwanese, so I'm not sure if they'd agree with using them. For example if the PLA wanted to land on the beaches west of Taoyuan, that's only about 20km/12.4mi away. Or Chiayi City, one of the more inland cities, about 30km/18.6mi away. I'm ignoring smaller urban areas in between, like Puzi, a city of 42k people about 13km/8mi from the coast. Even with tactical nukes, fallout would almost certainly spread across populated areas.

&gt;If the conventional weapons succeeded, the tactical nukes would be unneeded.

Why would tactical nukes succeed when conventional weapons didn't? The only difference between them is that you need more conventional weapons, and it's not like the US is incapable of producing large volumes of conventional arms.

*[During the Cold War](https://www.britannica.com/technology/tactical-nuclear-weapon), both the United States and the Soviet Union manufactured and deployed tens of thousands of tactical nuclear weapons. Those included nuclear artillery shells, nuclear antiaircraft missiles, and nuclear antitank rounds. However, none were ever used in combat. For destroying small targets, modern conventional munitions were found to be just as effective as nuclear weapons. The only advantage of nuclear weapons in a tactical situation is that one warhead can be used in place of many conventional explosives. In addition, neither of the superpowers was willing to risk unleashing all-out nuclear war by employing tactical nuclear weapons.*",a090074595abee4f095d5dfa70058f617c23c58c,True,False,,,,,0,1653271659,,0,{},i9mwiwu,False,t3_uuzzq8,False,True,t1_i9mgery,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uuzzq8/china_is_telegraphing_its_military_intent_time_to/i9mwiwu/,1653271672,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653242859.0

Stugna and NLAW seem to be plenty effective. 

&gt;And neither is a tank. I'm not sure where you're going with this. Infantry are the most vulnerable weapon system on the battlefield. That's not a controversial statement.

At the danger of repeating myself, there are methods of reducing the vulnerability of infantry, whereas for a tank, armor is supposed to be that protection. But it doesn't work. 

&gt;They really aren't. Artillery is a whole lot more accurate but not to such a degree that artillery replaces direct fire. And communications are faster but not to such a degree that you can replace having the weapon system immediately in front of you. 

Artillery can be accurate to within a meter. And communication happens at light speed. 

&gt;No. I'm not sure how you came to this determination at all. There's fewer assault guns and tank destroyers because the MBT does it all. The whole point of an MBT was to get away from Light, Medium and Heavy tanks and guns and go to one tank that was as fast as a light tank, as armored as a heavy tank and had the weight of a medium tank. 

That is obviously a physical impossibility. And what's the replacement for a ISU-152? Or a Sturmtiger? Why are these direct fire weapons suddenly not required? 

&gt;this is also not true. Tanks have been hit with ATGMs and survived thanks to their armor. A Challenger 2 was hit by a Milan and survived. A Challenger 2 took over 70 RPGs and made it home. Abrams tanks have been hit with ATGMs and not been destroyed. Israeli Merkavas have been hit by ATGMs and survived, including one that was penetrated and had an ammunition fire that was returned to the fight with a reserve crew.

This is like saying, because body armor stops a pistol bullet, firearms cannot defeat armor. The penetration of modern shaped charges surpasses the armor of tanks. And it's much easier to increase the size of a warhead than to add on additional armor to a tank. 

&gt;The idea that battleships were made obsolete by aircraft carriers is junk history. It's what you get if you have a surface level understanding of history.

I suppose the Japanese Navy also had a surface level understanding when they converted Shinano to a carrier. Even though she wasn't very good at that. 

&gt;Sure they went from being the keystone vessel in a surface group to being an essential piece of the carrier's defense but they weren't obsolete. 

An essential piece of the carrier's defense? By providing AA fire? 

&gt;An aircraft carrier could not bombard a shoreline or defend itself from enemy ships as effectively as a battleship. 

A carrier could defend itself much better by simply staying away from battleships. It could not deliver as much ordnance as a battleship, but this was another case where the cost outweighed the effectiveness. 

Or course, nowadays all battleships are retired, so according to you they are obsolete. So I suppose carrier aircraft have now learned how to correctly bombard a shoreline? 

&gt;Moreover, the reason aircraft carriers were so prominent was because most of the US' battleships were out of action at Pearl Harbor and we had no choice. Right up to Pearl Harbor War Plan Orange and the Japanese response envisioned a massive decisive battle in the Pacific Ocean between capital ships.

How often did Yamato fire her main guns at an enemy battleship? How often did Musashi? How often did Musashi fire her main guns at all? 

Maybe you can explain to the Japanese how they should have used their battleships, because they sure as hell did not know. 

&gt;What this war has shown us is bad tactics are bad.

OK, first of all, you discard this war and as a counter example you use some militants vs the IDF?

Then, what tactics? Can you please explain what tactics the Russians should use to identify and destroy all potential ATGM armed infantry? Ohh right, they could use artillery!

Oh, I know that, but I was referring to the Chaghatai Turks. I mean, when it comes to the southeastern turkic languages, isn't it karluk&gt;Chaghatai&gt;Uzbek and Uigher?

When I read your post about the kipchack genocide, I assumed the same happened to the karluk turks that made up most of the population of the chaghatai khanate, except taken to a further extent, with the karluk turks adopting the chaghatai name.

Just like the Turks of the golden horde underwent a gendercide, with the Mongols subsequently adopting kipchak culture, I assumed the karluks of the chaghati khanate underwent a similar process, except they were now called chaghatai turks. Even Ottoman historians of the time referred to the Mughal invasion of India, as an ""invasion of the chaghatai armies"".

And the Abrams is one of the most expensive MBTs. At any rate, lesser cost ATGMs may not be as effective against a modern MBT as Javelin is against last gen MBTs.

&gt; Infantry is not always vulnerable, certainly not when it's concealed and you don't know it's there.

And neither is a tank. I'm not sure where you're going with this. Infantry are the most vulnerable weapon system on the battlefield. That's not a controversial statement.

&gt; Both of these problems are now solved

They really aren't. Artillery is a whole lot more accurate but not to such a degree that artillery replaces direct fire. And communications are faster but not to such a degree that you can replace having the weapon system immediately in front of you. Tube artillery also can't carry the momentum of an attack, punch breakthroughs in enemy lines, exploit vulnerabilities and attack by fire and maneuver. You can't win a battle if you don't fire and maneuver.

&gt; There are few assault guns nowadays, though they were a mainstay in WW2. That's largely due to the increased ability of artillery to respond quickly and accurately. 

No. I'm not sure how you came to this determination at all. There's fewer assault guns and tank destroyers because the MBT does it all. The whole point of an MBT was to get away from Light, Medium and Heavy tanks and guns and go to one tank that was as fast as a light tank, as armored as a heavy tank and had the weight of a medium tank. The guns are multipurpose as well, able to fire all sorts of shells for different purposes. The British still use a rifled gun in their tank because it much more effectively delivers rounds for support infantry vs eliminating enemy armor.

Indirect fire cannot replace direct fire. Those are two different roles for a reason. I'm not sure where you get this idea that artillery behind the lines is more effective than an MBT on the frontlines at doing an MBT's job.

&gt; the development of shaped charges in combination with guided missiles made the armor part just fall flat

But this is also not true. Tanks have been hit with ATGMs and survived thanks to their armor. A Challenger 2 was hit by a Milan and survived. A Challenger 2 took over 70 RPGs and made it home. Abrams tanks have been hit with ATGMs and not been destroyed. Israeli Merkavas have been hit by ATGMs and survived, including one that was penetrated and had an ammunition fire that was returned to the fight with a reserve crew.

&gt; During the 30s, every large nation was still building battleships.

The idea that battleships were made obsolete by aircraft carriers is junk history. It's what you get if you have a surface level understanding of history. Battleships fought alongside carriers for all of WWII and beyond, the last US battleship was retired in the '90s. Sure they went from being the keystone vessel in a surface group to being an essential piece of the carrier's defense but they weren't obsolete. An aircraft carrier could not bombard a shoreline or defend itself from enemy ships as effectively as a battleship. The tactics changed to accommodate a change in technology and capabilities.

Moreover, the reason aircraft carriers were so prominent was because most of the US' battleships were out of action at Pearl Harbor and we had no choice. Right up to Pearl Harbor War Plan Orange and the Japanese response envisioned a massive decisive battle in the Pacific Ocean between capital ships.

&gt; This war is full of them

Sigh. This is the real problem with your, and others', assessment.

What this war has shown us is bad tactics are bad.

You mean to suggest we can extrapolate from Ukraine that tanks are a dead technology because one side has been flooded with the most modern ATGMs in the west for free while the other side is in a global economic blockade and has made every military blunder you can imagine? That's the takeaway here?

Key Takeaways

Ukrainian sources confirmed that Russian forces have secured local advances to the north and west of Popasna since at least May 20. Russian forces likely seek to push further west toward Bakhmut and north to support the encirclement of Severodonetsk but remain unlikely to achieve rapid advances.

Russian forces will likely attempt to hold positions west of the Siverskyi Donets River against Ukrainian attacks (rather than retreating across the river) to prevent further Ukrainian advances from threatening Russian lines of communication to Izyum.

Russian occupying forces continued filtration and deportation procedures in and around Mariupol.
Russian forces are likely preparing to resume offensives on the southern axis.

Immediate items to watch

Russian forces are likely reinforcing their grouping north of Kharkiv City to prevent further advances of the Ukrainian counteroffensive toward the Russian border. Russian forces may commit elements of the 1st Tank Army to northern Kharkiv in the near future. 

The Russians will continue efforts to encircle Severodonetsk and Lysychansk at least from the south, possibly by focusing on cutting off the last highway connecting Severodonetsk-Lysychansk with the rest of Ukraine.

Russian forces in Mariupol will likely shift their focus to occupational control of the city as the siege of Azovstal has concluded.

He was Barlas, an originally Mongol tribe that Turkified, in other words a Kipchak. Some scholars have debated whether the Barlas were more Turkic or more Mongol at that point, but the question is essentially immaterial because the Kipchak genocide ensured that *all* post-Genghis Kipchaks were to some extent Turkic-speaking Mongols: case in point, almost no Tatar or Kazakh tribes today remember any oral history of their people prior to the Golden Horde - this is because they are all children of the horde and have little connection to the ancient nomads that preceded it.

Timer actually predated the idea of an Uzbek. Uzbek identity had its roots in the conquest of Transoxiana by Abulkhayr Shaybani in the early 16th century. However, at that point the “Oz Begs” Shaybani commander were Kipchak-speaking nomads, not Karluk “sarts” (sedentary Turks), who also had no connection to Timur’s Barlas tribe.

The conception that “Uzbeks are Karluks” is a modern one. The Uzbeks assimilated into Transoxiana Sart culture over time, and the present Uzbek language has much more in common with the Persianized tongues that preceded it than the language spoken by Abulkhayr’s riders. Transoxiana’s locals, meanwhile, were far more likely to identify as “Sarts” than Uzbeks until the 1920s. At that point, Soviet anthropologists labeled them “Uzbek” and created a state around that somewhat shaky national identity. Similar “assignments” occurred to other Central Asian groups - Kazakhs, who pre-1920s self-described as Kyrgyz, similarly had a state built around them, while Kyrgyz who called themselves Kara-Kyrgyz (“Black Kyrgyz”) dropped the first half of their name.

Oguz Turks who were in CA at the time of the Mongol conquest suffered the same fate as the Kipchaks. They were the rulers of the Khwarazm empire named after their leading group, and under Jalalodin Mingburnu were hunted all the way to India and Kurdistan before finally perishing.
