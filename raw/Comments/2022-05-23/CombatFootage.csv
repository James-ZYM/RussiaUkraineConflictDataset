But people get confused really quickly and make false claims and attributions without checking.

Over 20 thousand Kurds working for Village guard system as unpaid volunteers. Proving motivations are not financial but disagreement with PKK.

The PKK in peak power barely mustered over 5k members.

Democratically speaking, since you should appreciate the rule of democracy and majority rules, the Kurds, overwhelmingly support the Turkish state.

I research and report on Turkey and its military interactions in ths region for a living. 

The PKK completely lost the Support of Kurds in Turkey. The final straw was in 2015 and 2016nwhen they launched failed insurrections that brought absolute chaos to where they tried it. Yet the Kurdish  towns and villages where they didnt try it, lived normal lives, went to school, went to work etc. It was then that the marginal amounts of support the PKK had inside Turkey ended.

Also the Ukrainians are going to get the L118/L119 light gun. Much lighter than the typical artillery that both sides are using and is extremely portable. Can potentially give Air Mobile or Light Infantry units a nice boost.

Falklands: A squaddie's unit gets either bombed or hit by an artillery strike. The squaddie being interviewed picks himself up after the strike is finished and checks for casualties. Sees another squaddie lying face down and motionless, looking a bit beat up, so he rolls him over to check what state the injured squaddie is in. As he rolls him over he finds himself looking into the empty skull of the ~~injured~~ dead squaddie who turned out to have had his face blown off and his brain had fallen out for lack of anything holding it in from the front.

Northern Ireland: The IRA blew up an army lorry with a roadside bomb, powerful enough that the only evidence of the driver was his pelvis still belted into the driving seat, according to a retired officer from the unit that was sent to deal with this. However, that was not the *real* bomb, that one was planted at a nearby farm building that the IRA planners had predicted the army would use as a forward base while they dealt with the roadside bomb. That one went off an blew the building apart.

So the tube/gun stays in place because the recoil from both sides equalize, while the warhead is propelled.


The PG (Propelled grenade/Rocket and warhead) is propelled out of the tube, the rocket is ignited and the warhead is propelled further downrange.


A Rocket Propelled Grenade of an RPG-7 sends all the pressure out of the back because it is fully rocket propelled.


The successor to both the SPG-9 and the RPG-7 are man-portable recoilless launchers such as the 'Carl Gustaf'. Which instead of being fully rocket propelled like traditional Anti-tank weapons; the warhead and rocket have the explosive propellant embedded into the design like a casing surrounding the rocket, similar to the casing of a 105mm artillery munition which also sometimes requires Nitro charges under the munition to be propelled further downrange. 


Recoilless launchers share the same cone system on the back of the launcher as the SPG-9


Recoilless launchers are much more simple to use in confined spaces such as apartment buildings than the RPG-7 due to the lower amount of back blast and the variety of ammunition/propellant. 


Due to the pre-packaged design of the munitions to recoilless launchers the loader must be mindful of which type of munition he loads into the recoilless launcher for the operator; unlike an SPG-9 where you can put 1 charge of propellant to reduce recoil to engage from a fortified and confined space and add more charges to recieve increased range if the space allows for it.


Simply: RPG-7 is just rocket propelled

Let's start with a bit of background, the jet is some sort of Su-25 (unsure which variants Ukraine operates). A ""normal"" all purpose load out for an Su-25 could consist between 2 or 4 rocket pods, the rocket pods in question are likely the B-8M1, a rocket pod designed for fixed wing aircraft capable of carrying 20 s-8 missiles. (Relatively comparable with nato Hydra-70) 

I believe these are s-8 missiles because the pilot launches a large salvo of relatively small looking warheads, and the s-8 is one of the most common unguided rockets in any post Soviet arsenal. 

Now, as I said before it is typical for an Su-25 to carry around 40 to 80 of these, hypothetically, it is possible to mount 8 of these rocket pods for a total of 160 rockets, but that is rare. I believe the one in the video has 80.

The tactical advantage of such an operation, as some other comments mentioned, is the ability to react quickly to enemy movements and/or strike when they are most vulnerable, while artillery would take a longer time to set up. I am not sure but I think in the video he is doing an indirect launch, meaning the target could be at a range of upwards of 4km.

However, you are mostly correct. Ideally it is unfeasible to risk such equipment for missions on this scope, with guided weapons being a much better alternative. I think it just comes to the fact that Ukraine could have fewer of those, while undoubtedly s-8 are in abundance everywhere, so it is mostly just using what they can.

Sorry for the long message, I can try to clarify if you have any questions.",c8243741176ee6b0754132c416621c70813978f4,True,False,,,,,0,1653344460,,0,{},i9qk5hy,False,t3_uw4sk8,False,True,t1_i9pzn65,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uw4sk8/a_raid_by_a_ukrainian_su25_attack_aircraft_on_the/i9qk5hy/,1653344472,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653315660.0,

&gt;Russia is **running out of precision guided munitions** and it is more   
likely to rely on so-called dumb bombs and artillery, a senior Pentagon   
official said on Thursday

How about CNN?

[https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-25-22/h\_2d7b4d93f817198e89d9a8278007e8e8](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-troops-food-fuel-ukraine-mod-b2038592.html)

&gt;The US has assessed that Russian forces are **running low on air-launched**   
**cruise missiles**, and there are indications they are trying to preserve   
that inventory as part of their declining stocks of precision guided   
munitions, according to a US defense official.

Or maybe Politico?

[https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/22/russia-hypersonic-missiles-low-stockpile-00019358](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/22/russia-hypersonic-missiles-low-stockpile-00019358)

&gt;The leading theory for why Russia launched hypersonic missiles into   
Ukraine last week is that it’s **running out of precision-guided weapons**   
to strike faraway targets, a senior U.S. defense official and a Western   
official familiar with assessments told POLITICO.

I really expected a declaration of war or some mechanism to call up infantry reserves since russia is doing so badly, the syeian  merc stories (didnt happen?) Or even call in military from other GUS states.

I dont think russia will retreat or back down in ukraine, costs already too high to abck down.
So either they think that they can still do without mobilisation or that a mobilisation and war would in some way backfire internally too much.

In my thinking russia due to the immense cost needs large gains in this war, until the dnepr river line.

IHL prohibits attacks directed against civilians, as well as indiscriminate attacks, namely those that strike military objectives and civilians or civilian objects without distinction. Principle of proportionality: IHL prohibits attacks that may be expected to cause excessive incidental civilian harm in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.

Its not a desperation tactic. Its included in manuals and it is trained. There are proceedments on what airspeed, angle and distance to use to attack a given area.   


Ineffective? that would be like saying MRLS are ineffective compared with, for example, tanks. If you compare with direct fire, its always going to be less effective.  
However, like MRLS, it is a low risk, some reward tactic. It is safer and achieves results.  
Rockets are cheap, fuel is cheap, and they have huge stocks of both. Actual helicopters and pilot training are expensive. So they are getting uses out of them with little exposition.  


**""A self-proclaimed superpower, with an arsenal of Wunderwaffen should be able to do SEAD""**

&amp;#x200B;

**""This is embarrassing for the aggressor that had the element of surprise and planning. While on the defensive, a safety oriented use off assets of the defender makes sense.""**  


What you say makes no sense. It is common knowledge that it is always harder for the attacker than for the defender. Why should the attacker waste their resources by getting them crippled in a high risk enviroment?  


  


BTW, They mostly use this tactic with helicopters. Have seen plenty of videos, including some from the cabin like this video, doing direct attack with rockets.

920,[],False,,JIHAAAAAAD,,,[],,,,text,t2_gsy0h,False,False,"&gt; Why? What makes you think Russia can take the pain longer than Ukraine?

It has greater strategic depth and the war is somewhat popular there. Anti-West nationalistic narrative still finds a home in Russia. Furthermore, Ukrainian economy is taking a much greater hit and with an up and coming recession the West will curtail economic funding.

&gt; Russian economy will only decline the longer the war lasts and the sooner the West switches away from Russian oil and gas.

Eh, Russian economy was not that great anyway, but it may find some stability in a very suboptimal state. Asia and Africa do need their energy needs met and Russia is a ready supplier. Secondly while Europe is trying to wean itself off Russian energy, it is easier said than done. Energy is a very expensive resource nowadays and the West has earned the scorn of many major energy producers. In the short term, the West will need Russian energy.

&gt; West has a massively larger economy than Russia and can easily support Ukraine financially and militarily at only a fraction of the cost to their economies as Russia's cost in supporting the war. 

War needs a lot more than finances. Ukrainian supply chain situation is slowly but surely getting worse as Russia slowly degrades their infrastructure. Secondly in the medium term Ukraine will start facing fuel crises. Transporting fuel by road from across Europe is not going to be sustainable.

&gt; All indications are that Ukrainians have massive motivational advantage over Russians. It may be a long war before Russia cracks, but all the long term trends are in favor of Ukraine as long as they stay the course.

Artillery barrages have a strange way of killing motivation. The West is supporting Ukraine but only enough so that they can provide attrition to Russia rather than providing any decisive advantage. Secondly, Ukraine has shown little appetite for offensive ops and whatever offensive ops they have done have had questionable results. With the limited Russian objectives of LNR and DNR Russia does not need to fight that much other than establishing territorial control and then throwing LNR and DNR troops on the line in a low intensity conflict similar to that of 2014 to 2022. 

While it is true that Ukraine is motivated, what people fail to understand is that Russia is too. It is not simply a Putin war, rather this is an existential crisis for Russia. Russia is paranoid of European expansionism due to its geography and hence paradoxically Russia finds security through expansion. Russian national security has always been either Russia expands or Russia dies. Even if Putin dies right now, I would be very surprised if his successor simply abandons this conflict.",bf120c206762b8e3b519c5043932036efb0f9e8e,True,False,,,,,0,1653338237,,0,{},i9q6fvj,False,t3_uvzd0a,False,True,t1_i9psx2e,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uvzd0a/local_sources_report_the_beginning_of_the_assault/i9q6fvj/,1653338254,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653309437.0,

&gt; It’s proven that artillery with targeting technology is more accurate than manual targeting.

It's proven that artillery with _guidance_ is more accurate, like the Excalibur round fired from M777s - those have stabilising fins which can adjust in-flight to get the round closer to where it was meant to go. These rockets do not have this or anything like this.

From a ""targeting"" perspective, what you're meaning when you say targeting technology are things like GPS, computers, atmospheric sensors. All of which which, both solutions possess.

An MLRS, firing at a town, uses the same fundamentals as the jet firing at the town. Range, speed, altitude, trajectory, ammunition, air pressure, and so on. These have not changed in over a century of indirect fire. 

The jet does it for you. The MLRS does not. This is because the pilot simply does not have the time to do that while flying a jet. However this targeting method does not result in increased accuracy against an MLRS. This is because it is not doing anything different. 

I beg you to look into ""gun laying"", because it's a very static field with few advancements. I also implore you to seriously try and understand what CCIP is - it's a very simple system so you should have no problem understanding why it's not helping the issue at hand - accuracy once the rocket leaves the tube.",bc8ea6af3a86db315f3e9da284969933452ed226,True,False,,,,,0,1653337412,,0,{},i9q4jvb,False,t3_uw4sk8,False,True,t1_i9q1tr8,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uw4sk8/a_raid_by_a_ukrainian_su25_attack_aircraft_on_the/i9q4jvb/,1653337430,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653308612.0,

There were like 50 million civilian dead in WW2 versus about 9 million in WW1.

However, you don't see shit like the Brusilov offensive in WW2, where the *winning* side, in that case the Russians (the one good offensive by them the entire war), suffers *half a million casualties in a single month.* Stalingrad is infamous for being a battle where both sides poured in something like a million casualties, but that is over an 8 month period, akin to Verdun's extended length.

&gt;United States of America
The US Naval Handbook (2007) states:
Belligerents are forbidden to bombard a city or town that is undefended and that is open to immediate entry by their own or allied forces. A city or town behind enemy lines is, by definition, neither undefended nor open, and military targets therein may be destroyed by bombardment. 


and

&gt;United States of America
The US Rules of Engagement for Operation Desert Storm (1991) prohibits firing at civilian populated areas or buildings which are not defended nor are being used for military purposes.

from icrc.org

&gt;a report submitted to Congress by the US Department of Defense in 1992 states that the rule is not customary and is contrary to the traditional law of war because it shifts the burden of determining the precise use of an object from the defender to the attacker, i.e., from the party controlling that object to the party lacking such control. This imbalance would ignore the realities of war in demanding a degree of certainty of the attacker that seldom exists in combat. It would also encourage the defender to ignore its obligations to separate civilians and civilian objects from military objectives.",23580732589dc0b7effe7c653fa18ce69e6a98a5,True,False,,,,,0,1653335633,,0,{},i9q0f52,False,t3_uw0pj3,False,True,t1_i9pyxfm,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uw0pj3/tos_hits_ammo_storage_secondary_explosion_visible/i9q0f52/,1653335650,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653306833.0,

In my opinion they lost their advances not as much to poor logistics or fighting in a ""non-Russian""-way but rather due to lack of infantry from the get-go. They simultaneously launched *four* offensives with some 250 000 men in an attempt to capture a country that is about the **same size of France**. A nation that unlike most other wars in the 90s or early -00s has a somewhat modern armed forces. And the Russians *still* don't have the soldiers necessary for achieving any of their initial wargoals.

Dropping from a level flight or on a shallow dive provides a more stable platform as you maintain the aircraft attitude during the release.

Main advantage is the increased distance to release the weapon to stay clear from ainti aircraft weapons and sacrificing accuracy for safety. 

Now taking unguided rockets that are even more inaccurate than a freefall bomb plus lighter and more impacted by weather (wind) does not seem to help precision at all. 

This does not look very accurate at all. There is probably a reason why this form of attack was never trained in western airforces. Otherwise it would have been more used.

Worries are increasing that the militias could drag Iraq into the growing proxy war between the U.S. and Iran in the Middle East. The United States and its ally, Israel, are targeting pro-Iranian militias across Lebanon, Syria and Iraq with economic sanctions and airstrikes hitting their bases and other infrastructure.

Iran also supports many of the militias that mobilized in 2014 to battle the Islamic State group, gaining outsized influence as militiamen joined security forces and U.S. troops to defeat the extremists. Those state-sanctioned, mainly Shiite militias, known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, have grown into a powerful political faction estimated to have the most seats in the Iraqi parliament.’

For really accurate unguided artillery you need 3 things:

You need good maps and GPS data. You need to be able to plot your own position and elevation, and your target's position and elevation, with very good precision. 

You need good math skills.

You need to know a lot of data about the environment. Windspeed, pressure, temperature, and more. All of that data affects the round and leaving out any variables that do can negatively impact the precision of your shot.

All of that information is calculated for the gun crew by the M777's fire control computer. The gun knows exactly where it is down to cm of precision. They get target coordinates from a central fire control with as much precision as they can. The computer does all of the work of calculating where to point the gun.

This is not how they do it in Russia. In Russia, they are still using old grid maps. Old, outdated maps with poor small scale precision. They're still using range tables, basically a paper cheat sheet for elevation based on crude distances of 100's of meters. There's no, or limited ability to account for environmental effects like crosswinds. Measurement of distance is done with rulers and compasses and slide rules for calculating.

The difference ends up being that a m777 gun crew can put rounds within 15m of a target point pretty reliably, and then don't need to adjust much to obtain direct hits. Meanwhile, a Russian battery has an accuracy of hundreds of meters, and has to fire way more rounds and adjust fire several times to get hits. This takes time. It's also the difference between firing 3-5 rounds and getting a hit, vs firing 10-20 rounds. Or needing to use 1-2 guns vs 8-10 to accomplish a fire mission.

The Ukrainian army replicated the fire control computer on the M777 and their own Soviet systems with iPads and laptops, using drones and commercially available GPS devices to sub in for US Army stuff.

The other, and more important reason the computers were removed is because they're all designed to network together. A battery of guns networks up to receive targets from a central fire direction control center, and enables distributed fire from any gun within range of a target. The encryption tech and the software are things the army doesn't want Russia to get ahold of.",d062f3c9a089ef983046656b4ce0c6c3e272c7bd,True,False,,,,,0,1653327980,,0,{},i9pihw1,False,t3_uvyc7r,False,True,t1_i9oy12n,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uvyc7r/direct_155mm_howitzer_hit_on_a_russian_vehicle_by/i9pihw1/,1653327992,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653299180.0,

Sure but not the same amount of oxygen is consumed and conventional weapons. Thermobaric explosive just consume a lot of oxygen in their AoE

&gt;and the vacuum effect is not unique to thermobaric weapons.

I think the only other weapon capable of vacuum effect is nuclear weapons because that burns too but anyone within oxygen consumption range is gonna be toasted inside out anyways

&gt;but it's not something that can't be achieved by bigger warheads

K

but the thermobaric weapons' capability is being able to travel the distance oxygen travels. Which means they are more effective against pretty much anything that puts a barrier between the target and the explosion. You can stand behind a wall that is strong enough to resist a conventional explosive's strength but you can't stand behind a wall that could prevent burning air from going around around the wall and reaching into your lungs.

This is like arguing that conventional weapons can achieve the same damage as nuclear weapons, you just gotta increase the load.",9728c879f703d1d976983dcb597d89d7b6d12159,True,False,,,,,0,1653325969,,0,{},i9pdppo,False,t3_uw0pj3,False,True,t1_i9pbvkg,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uw0pj3/tos_hits_ammo_storage_secondary_explosion_visible/i9pdppo/,1653325988,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653297169.0,

The whole donbass conflict started with Girkin along with Spetsnaz and Wagner seizing administration buildings, then directing the recruitment of soldiers while also ""holiday soldiers"" and some regular soldiers disguised battled along with security services personnel directing assets.  


Before this current invasion they were busting pro-russian Russian security services curated cells left and right.   


If you go back and look back on the vice roulette series knowing just how many people were undercover agents or FSB personnel  or assets or Spetsnaz makes it really crazy to think how we didn't know.  


The issue is of course there were divisions and always people that favoured Russia. But Girkin himself admits at first it was just him and his guys clashing with Right Sector nationalists and Donbass battalion and the like. It took a lot of work to make it a full on war and flooding the place with weapons and recruitment. Girkin admits it would have ""fizzled out like Odessa and Kharkiv without this"".  


The most important take away is while there may be division, Putin and by extension his security services are extremely paranoid. In Russia right now if you try and make a pro-war demonstration you could be fined or likely even jailed. They don't allow **organic movements**. People at the pro-putin Rally last month were asked why they were there and  were admitting they were told to be there. The government simply puts pressure on civil service areas and others dependent on state salary to make them come out to protests.   


That's how you had suddenly kids dying of cancer standing in a Z for a photo op. It's all directed from the top.  


So looking back on the Donbass situation, a lot of it wasn't totally manufactured, but it wasn't organic. The actual organic protests tended to fizzle out like Odessa.  


Things like when they seized administration buildings was basically Russian intelligence services led. It's like how suddenly all the naval and military bases were spontaneously seized in Crimea.  It's likely a similar thing for the military/ strategic events like when in one \`Vice Russian Roulette some thugs (accompanied by some locals) halt a Ukrainian Military column and seize their weapons from them and take their firing pins.   


It's funny how Putin scapegoats his intelligence services staff but they were extremely successful in Donbass and Crimea, many of their operations were perfectly deniable and synergised with organic events like small scale protests to the point that it's only years later it started coming out.",06692c1490e416400cfa144492c3a531eac308a9,True,False,,,,,0,1653325821,,0,{},i9pdd2f,False,t3_uw49la,False,True,t1_i9p91t0,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uw49la/ukrainian_military_probably_72nd_mechanized/i9pdd2f/,1653325835,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653297021.0,

Well… Since the last time we chatted, Russia followed through and withdrew from northern Ukraine entirely. [The DoD says as recently as Friday the Russian forces continue to lose ground and be pushed back north of Kharkiv.](https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/3038153/senior-defense-official-holds-a-background-briefing/).

The openly documented losses show that Russia has lost [3,818 pieces of major military equipment](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html?m=1), while the Ukrainians have lost only [1,070](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-ukrainian.html?m=1). In point of fact the Ukrainians now have more Russian tanks than they started the war with. 

[And the Moskva was sunk just after the last time we talked, along with 8 smaller naval losses in the Black Sea fleet.](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/03/list-of-naval-losses-during-2022.html?m=1)

Last time we talked - 30 days ago -I said it would be around 90 days before Russia gave up and went home. Arms continue to pour into the Ukraine from NATO, so the Ukraine has enough resupply to keep this up indefinitely. 

I still think Russia has about 60 more days of endurance - military resupply and political will - for this war.

I can just add that the mobilisation potential of modern countries is much weaker compared to ww2 owing to a much older population. 

Below is a link to Ukraine population pyramid in 2015, only 5,175 million are men between 19 and 35, this figure includes the dombass and crimea. In reality if you account for those unsuitable for military service or required in other roles the realistic maximum recruitable male population would be 2 million? perhaps a bit more.

Waves (or rather ""stages"") of mobilization is a specific legal term. You can think of it as conscription laws in HoI4: those are levels that describe pools from which you can conscript people, each following wave draws from a larger pool.

1st wave: former professional military under 40 who fought in Donbass
2nd wave: those who were conscripted after 2014 and served a year in army
3rd wave: those who completed officer courses while studying in universities 
4th wave: ""All Adults Serve"" essentially (unless you have specific medical conditions, you are a sole provider for kids and so on)

The thing is, there is a huge jump from 3rd wave to 4th, from hundreds of thousands to ten million people, maybe more. When I asked whether I can serve back in April, they said they don't need me because I don't have military experience. Also the current stage is not disclosed, you can just guess it based on people who are conscripted or official announcements. But apparently some people think those ""waves"" are conscription campaigns of sort when there is a specific quota that has to be reached.

About men not being permitted to leave Ukraine — it's more about economy, I think. Someone has to work, run industries, pay taxes etc. Also men serve as an anchor for women who leave — a family who found some job in Germany might stay permanently, but with their husbands and sons staying they are forced to return.",5a48094e28fb9f40a39f81a19ea35733faa49e48,True,False,,,,,0,1653315756,,0,{},i9opsyz,False,t3_uvp6j1,False,True,t3_uvp6j1,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uvp6j1/ukraine_discussionquestion_question_52322/i9opsyz/,1653315766,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653286956.0,

I don't think Ukrainian really has much choice but to use pre-existing military structures to train their troops in. You can't just click a button and spawn another training facility with all the personal, logistics and equipment it needs. There's a difference between taking over a school or mall as an impromptu FOB or defensive position, compared to establishing an entire training facility.

That said common sense tells me they're probably doing their best to train troops in undisclosed locations and keeping it a secret.

Because several of those videos appeared in a short time, all with very similar messages. You didn't have content like that on the first weeks, when the situation was much more critical.

I've had a similar thought regarding the supply lines being targeted as well as some key weapons being destroyed (Russian claims of destroying S-300s or similar), I thought of the scenario to simply confirm they are and appear weaker, while the reality is different. So I can say it's plausible, but it's not something you can have in a discussion (unless the discussion revolves around ""what do you think about them doing this as a strategy"") - if you use it as a strong argument, it's basically copium/hopium. So whether it's true or not, let's see :)

And I'm an arm-chair general (field marshall is cool as well). If they do defense in depth, they need the other side to attack consistently, so it does make sense. But again, the opposite may be true and they have issues in morale (it would make sense objectively as war is not easy, especially when there's a high attrition rate, and command can always have stupid decisions). I just find the videos posted questionable and jumping to a conclusion from a few videos that it's the realistic situation is even more questionable.

Fair point that is has similarities, but still - completely different situation. Being cut off by sea means any routes of attack or resupply are cut down to having a navy or supply ships. Which Ukraine didn't have. Having your back to the river means any reinforcement or supply routes are made much harder, but they still are somewhat doable + you can place your artillery on the other side of the river (not that anyone would do it on that exact position, close to the river), and have a shelling route open.

Not to mention, Mariupol was a lost cause, as far as support from other parts of the army - they were much further + they would need to push the lines really close to make anything happen. The encirclement of Mariupol couldn't be under any immediate threat, while in Severodonetsk is completely different. Whether they manage to do it on the same extent as Mariupol remains to be seen, but at the moment, there's no reason to jump to that conclusion.

Azovstal is something different, there's no fortress-like structure similar to Azovstal, so it will be easier for Russia to conquer if they manage to keep the encirclement.",13ecdf73209191bdae057ebdbc551958cc4d3659,True,False,,,,,0,1653305941,,0,{},i9o7kpe,False,t3_uvp6j1,False,True,t1_i9o1i6r,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uvp6j1/ukraine_discussionquestion_question_52322/i9o7kpe/,1653305958,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653277141.0,

Also today is a very important day which could fundamentally change this war in the coming weeks. Today defence ministers from 40 countries supporting Ukraine are set to meet/repeat Rammstein meeting. It is expected EU and US will announce heavy weapons delivery to Ukraine.

It’s highly likely that Ukraines request for US MLRS with precision guided long range missiles both GM and ATCMAS will be granted effectively giving Ukraine sub 5m precision at ranges of 70-250km.

Its also highly likely NATO will grant Ukraines request for NASAMS 3 (Patriot is unlikely) since it can be supported and supplied by EU states as well and is being actively replaced by Patriot.

Additionally its very likely that Ukraine will also be getting Harpoon missiles after Israel provided it with BlueSpear.

More so US has agreed to provide Ukraine with long range guided Advanced ATGMs for their TB2 fleet.

And Canada announced that they will start deliveries of Excalibur artillery rounds. These are GPS guided and rocket assisted rounds giving Ukraine (which already has longer and more precise artillery range) even long range an option to keep their artillery safely way behind the front lines.",eeebd24cc4c7b0d7df33d67e7a0c1c358314dc8c,True,False,,,,,0,1653303096,,0,{},i9o3lkn,False,t3_uvp6j1,False,True,t1_i9nwfk5,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uvp6j1/ukraine_discussionquestion_question_52322/i9o3lkn/,1653303113,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653274296.0,

The analogy of a plane cannot be used to describe every aspect of a shell, no. I used that to explain how excalibur maintains the same cep regardless of distance. I know this to be a fact and that is what you were asking about.

Yes, it uses GPS and INS before its terminal phase where it picks up the laser. But you asked me if the accuracy drops off at the end of their max range, which it does not. I was explaining how course correction allows it to maintain the same CEP regardless of range (something conventional munitions are incapable of).

I never said excalibur has the ability to course correct regardless of trajectory. You asked about accuracy at extreme range and that is what I was addressing. Unlike a conventional shell, these slight course corrections allow it to maintain a sub 4m CEP at all ranges. I'm not sure why you think I claimed it could make course corrections regardless of trajectory. 


I know the limitations of laser designators. I know they aren't perfect. Likewise, you won't see a laser guided munition being used if a good laze can't be achieved. This still is not really relevant to what you asked me though. Being terminally guided by a laser does not cause an increased CEP at extreme ranges. 

I never said every shot is perfect. In fact, in my original comment, I said first round hits should be the vast majority with these types of shells. Excalibur achieves first round hits over 90% of the time. That's the vast majority. 

[You asked how certain I was that the accuracy of these smart shells doesn't drop off suddenly. I said I was very certain. If you don't believe me you can take it directly from the army themselves.](https://imgur.com/a/vBPRsrO)

I don't think random redditors have any say in our policy. 

&gt;including the fall of Raqqa and Mosul. Pretending that Turkey did more than any other NATO country is silly. 

It didn't do more then US but it's something to keep in mind.

&gt;Turkey was the only NATO country bordering ISIS territory, so it was literally the only NATO country capable of launching its own offensive against ISIS. And it still waited forever to do so, which led directly to the US deciding to team up with the YPG instead. 

It waited because it didn't want to enter Syria at all at first. Even when it launched an operation against ISIS a lot of international actors deemed it an invasion.

Turkey started conducting airstrikes in 2015 and launched a full scale offensive in 2016. It didn't really wait forever for anything.

&gt;No offense, but that’s not how international politics works. There’s a very long list of examples in history where one party has been allied with two other parties that were fighting each other. Turkey has done it plenty of times.

I get you but what happened in Syria is one step too far. It's like Turkey supporting an anti-American militia in Mexico to combat cartels and drug trade. It's not a good idea.

I agree that Turkey should have acted earlier but first choice of proxies for both US and Turkey was the FSA. After Russian intervention the US kinda switched to YPG and FSA slowly but surely got more and more radicalized. Turkey was left with proxies that were seen as the enemy and allies that supported its own enemies, it's a mess really.",9bf0d2016dc262157860ce1c5fa9046e46285830,True,False,,,,,0,1653296149,,0,{},i9nvocy,False,t3_uvk1x2,False,True,t1_i9ntkcc,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uvk1x2/turkish_military_targets_multiple_ypgpkk/i9nvocy/,1653296163,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653267349.0,

You might not remember it, but others do. I’ve literally been told the YPG is worse by Turkish nationalists here on Reddit. 

&gt; but still it's the only NATO country to launch an offensive against ISIS

This is drawing an arbitrary line. Almost every NATO country contributed air assets to the US-led operation against ISIS. The US was directly involved in almost every major battle against ISIS, including the fall of Raqqa and Mosul. Pretending that Turkey did more than any other NATO country is silly. 

Turkey was the only NATO country bordering ISIS territory, so it was literally the only NATO country capable of launching its own offensive against ISIS. And it still waited forever to do so, which led directly to the US deciding to team up with the YPG instead. 

&gt; You don't support your ally's enemy tp deal with another common enemy.

No offense, but that’s not how international politics works. There’s a very long list of examples in history where one party has been allied with two other parties that were fighting each other. Turkey has done it plenty of times.

In any case, this could’ve been avoided if Turkey had been willing to fight ISIS on the ground from the beginning. But it wasn’t. The US needed a partner on the ground in Syria to fight ISIS, and the YPG were the only ones willing and able to do so. If Turkey had been willing to step up, America would’ve backed them instead. But Erdogan recoiled from fighting ISIS until the YPG was about to link its cantons. Erdogan was, in that way, responsible for the YPG-USA alliance.",89bd39213a4f01f702403901d71399164d461ed8,True,False,,,,,0,1653294158,,0,{},i9ntkcc,False,t3_uvk1x2,False,True,t1_i9nrwh3,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uvk1x2/turkish_military_targets_multiple_ypgpkk/i9ntkcc/,1653294172,1,False,False,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653265358.0,

In the West Kurds were highlighted more (they did do a lot of work as they were one of the most effected groups) because of the West's and the Kurd's mutual affinity and their potrayal as a secular, democratic force (problematic to some extent). Secondly the Shia militias were very very religious in character, and had some traits similar to ISIS. Not to mention, they included people who were radically anti-West, and were supported and trained by Iran which put them on opposite ends with the US/West. Some militias under the Shia banners were those which fought against the US army during the invasion. Shia mobilisation occured after, or at least in part due to, the call by Ayatollah Sistani.

Mainly the Shia militias were organised under the state banner or were state adjacent. Popular Mobilisation Forces and the Peace Brigades (related to Sadr to some extent) being the most prominent. Hezbollah was very active in Syria against the IS.

The guys at oryx took a break for a few days so sorry for no update on my side. With the next update i think i will need to shift some stuff on a second sheet. I tried to prevent this by moving things back and forth but there are simply to much vehicles with every update.

Some smaller stuff like ATGM's and MANPADS still missing and i don't think i'll add them anytime soon just a waste of costly pixels.

Disclaimer: I am no expert on russian military vehicles so those graphics for the vehicles may sometimes be wrong i tried my best to match them as good as possible and change them from time to time.

I've only seen one video but it was enough. I made myself a promise to cherish the fact that I live in a peaceful country and will likely never be confronted to those horrors...

It really humbled me. I don't need more gore in my life.

But I know a few people, who either don't care about what's going on in the world, or think Justin Trudeau is a nazi... they could use a reality check and see what horror truly is.

Those victims in the video, they wished they were alive, or at least wished they could have hugged their family one last time. They can't and couldn't. I'm pretty sure if they could tell me one thing, it would be to love my family and friends, and that's my take. 

So while I won't watch their final moments... I'll do my best to love my people, and thru that, hopefully I can make them victims live thru my heart a bit.

It is cheesy, but what else can I do.

And that’s a common argument atheists being up but I don’t see why, the Quran doesn’t say that times are free of evil or bad things. Allah did not tell us that life would be easy or forever good, even if you do not believe in God; the Quran is a book that contains a moral code that teaches you how to deal with some of those struggling times. 

My belief is to be God would mean to be most affective would be to act in a way where no one would be sure if you’ve done anything at all, reliance is not a positive thing for either being, even if it would mean more positive results for us. 

I don’t care if you don’t follow Islam nor if you do not believe in God, you can do what you wish. I will at least tolerate the decision so long as it doesn’t affect me.

It's like they are ticking a box on ammunition usage perday as a metric for winning the war? Or to prove they are doing something even though that something is inaccurate AF.

Take a look at germany post world war 1 and post world war 2. The allies learnt from their mistakes. Punishing countries do not work, isolating nations do not work. 

Notice that the comment above me said ""russia"", not putins flavor of russia. My point still stands, germany, and japan, recieved extensive support from the western nations post world war 2 specifically to avoid a situation like that of post world war 1, where the treatment of germany after the peace treaty led to the ride of fascism within germany.

They were trained worse, because they build up their own training system. The German Wehrmacht was very much not thrilled about a second army in Germany and denied them any help. The Waffen-SS training program had to rely on former soldiers and put ""loyality to the fascist idea"" over qualifications.

&gt;  were they just given more opportunity to be in Combat

Yes, the Nazis took care that the Waffen-SS as the ""Nazi Party Guard"" was always fighting were important events happend. Quickly the SS Units became ""the firemen of the eastern front"". Move from the north to the south and back, from large battle to large battle.

&gt; which made them a better unit

It didnt. The Waffen-SS got some priority for mechanization, especially for infantry mechanization. But at the same time the Wehrmacht complained about the Waffen-SS units on a regular basis. Those units fought hard, sometimes fanatic, but doing so suffered above average losses.

&gt;Although the liberation struggle of the PKK was originally guided by the prospect of creating a Kurdish nation state on a Marxist–Leninist basis,[7][10] Öcalan became disillusioned with the nation-state model and state socialism.[11] Influenced by ideas from Western thinkers such as the libertarian anarchist and social ecologist Murray Bookchin,[12][13][14] Öcalan reformulated the political objectives of the Kurdish liberation movement, abandoning the old statist and centralizing socialist project for a radical and renewed proposal for democratic-libertarian socialism that no longer aims at building an independent state separate from Turkey, but at establishing an autonomous, democratic and decentralized entity based on the ideas of democratic confederalism.[15][16]

&gt;Rejecting both the authoritarianism and bureaucracism of state socialism and the predation of capitalism, seen by Öcalan as most responsible for the economic inequalities, sexism and environmental destruction in the world, [7][17] democratic confederalism defends a ""type of organization or administration can be called non-state political administration or stateless democracy"",[1] which would provide the framework for the autonomous organization of ""every community, confessional group, gender specific collective and / or minority ethnic group, among other"".[4] It is a model of participatory democracy[18] built on the self-government of local communities and the organization of open councils, town councils, local parliaments, and larger congresses,[4] where citizens are the agents of self-government, allowing individuals and communities to exercise a real influence over their common environment and activities.[2][19] Inspired by the struggle of women in the PKK, democratic confederalism has feminism as one of its central pillars.[1][19] Seeing patriarchy as ""an ideological product of the national state and power"" no less dangerous than capitalism,[20] Öcalan advocates a new vision of society in order to dismantle the institutional and psychological relations of power currently established in capitalist societies and to ensure that women have a vital and equal role to that of men at all levels of organization and decision-making.[12][13] Other key principles of democratic confederalism are environmentalism, multiculturalism (religious, political, ethnic and cultural), individual freedoms (such as those of expression, choice and information), self-defense, and a sharing economy where control of economic resources does not belong to the state, but to society.[21][22] Although it presents itself as a model opposed to the nation-state, democratic confederalism admits the possibility, under specific circumstances, of peaceful coexistence between both, as long as there is no intervention by the state in the central issues of self-government or attempts at cultural assimilation.[23] Although it was theorized initially as a new social and ideological basis for the Kurdish liberation movement, democratic confederalism is now presented as an anti-nationalist, multi-ethnic and internationalist movement.[2][24][25]

&gt;Between 9[60] and 11 August 2014,[61] a safe corridor was established from the mountain enabling 10,000 people to evacuate on the first day.[60] Kurdish fighters of Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) entered the Sinjar Mountains with trucks and tractors to carry out the sick and elderly into Syria via a path that was cleared by Syrian Kurdish militants (YPG). According to Dr. Salim Hassan, a professor at the University of Sulaymaniyah and spokesman of the uprooted Yazidis, the PKK and YPG enabled an estimated 35,000 of the initially 50,000 trapped Yazidis to escape into Syria.[61] According to the account of the Sinjar District Governor, the route was jointly set up by Peshmerga and the YPG.[60]

Early in the war their air force was having quite a bit of success against RU but Ukraine simply doesn't have the air power to match Russia's AA defense capabilities and the skies over Ukraine have been increasingly barren of Ukrainian air power. Their armor is just as vulnerable to ATGM as Russia's but Russia' also puts a lot of effort into their anti-armor capabilities on the ground.   


Western powers rely more on their air to deal with armor. Without Ukraine being able to establish air superiority, the likelihood of them being able to achieve the effect of combined arms is low. Russia was most likely never striving for air dominance early in the war - my guess is after they knew they weren't going to be able to hold Hostomel, they gave up on that goal quickly. We've seen them pivot their strategy to an artillery duel in the East, which they are arguably winning. With the Crimean land bridge established Russia is now encircling portions of Ukraine's military in small pockets in the Donetsk and whittling them down. It's going to be a brutal grinding war, but no doubt in my mind, without direct Western intervention Russia will not lose this war - they may settle for Donetsk / Luhansk but that would still be a huge victory for RU on the international stage.",41e4c443df165f2fc8b412c02b21b344522e984a,True,False,,,,,0,1653265317,,0,{},i9mk37d,False,t3_uuiquq,False,True,t1_i9m3mps,/r/CombatFootage/comments/uuiquq/new_footage_of_the_work_of_the_american_howitzer/i9mk37d/,1653265334,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1653236517.0,
