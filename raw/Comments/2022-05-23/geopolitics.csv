In Russia's favour.

1. High commodity prices in part brought about by the war allows Russia's economy to tick along albeit at a somewhat lackluster pace
2. Can still trade with China/India so sanctions are not all that effective
3. Large soviet stockpiles of dumb munitions.
4. A functional, working artillery system. Orlan-10....
5. Logistics- Donbass is on Russia's back door.
6. Exterior lines.
7. Europe still buying Russian gas.

Against Russia

1. Is going to start facing superior NATO equipment.
2. Number's. Politically unpalatable for Russia to mobilize. So has to work with what its got against a numerically superior enemy
3. Can't capture a city without destroying it. So these gains are sort of meaningless
4. Exterior lines

&amp;#x200B;

In Ukraine's favour

1. Going to get NATO equipment. Will have better ranged and more accurate artillery than Russia. Plus some other toys.
2. Numbers. Are fighting for their existence. So can justify going to ""total war"", general mobilization
3. Interior lines

Against Ukraine

1. Economy doesn't really exist anymore. Can't get wheat etc. out of the country, no oil for the private sector. As a result becoming completely dependent on foreign aid.
2. Logistic's - Getting gear from the West into the Donbass is quite a task. Can't use rail as Russia has destroyed. Can't use ports as Russia is blockading. Have to use trucks. Trucks are not ideal for this sort of distance.
3. Has already lost a chunk of territory. This will require an offensive to take back. Questions over whether Ukraine is capable of this offensive.
4. Quantities of foreign equipment may not be enough.
5. Dependence on foreign aid means that the war is essentially out of their control.

&gt;you are outnumbered in every aspect (…) by the time you need to reload your weapon, there are 24 guys on top of you

Firstly, aside from being a laughable FPS concept, the numerical advantage you talk about in population has little to no relevance militarily. The entire premise of an invasion of Taiwan hinges on the PLANMC developing (now expanding) its amphibious capability to project force in the ECS/on Taiwan. Sealift isn’t simple, especially when your opponent’s primary focus in asymmetric warfare is on anti-shipping weaponry. If you’re envisioning an “enemy at the gates” scenario, as people tend to do when they think of China and Korea, that’s terribly misconceived.

&gt;they have hypersonic weapons

You’re talking about ballistic missiles? A SCUD from 1970 can be considered hypersonic. The rocket force will absolutely have a place in pre-bombardment in a hypothetical invasion, but it’s disingenuous to suggest they have some magic technology that magically lets them win.

&gt;they have nuclear weapons

This only becomes relevant in strategic deterrence, as the use of tactical devices while recovering a purported “breakaway state” serves no purpose to antagonize you domestically and internationally.

&gt;they have the largest navy in the world

Check by tonnage. The count of patrol craft in your navy matters little.

&gt;they have a respectable air force

I’d agree, and say that it’s one of the most concerning challenges Taiwanese defence planners face. There isn’t a conventional way to challenge air superiority besides building an extensive IADS, which is the teasing behind building domestic SAMs and importing the MIM-104.

SEAD/DEAD from a strategic bombing perspective is irrelevant, due to the proximity of Russian air bases to the conflict zone:

Outfits like RUSI like to claim that the Russian strategic bombing capability is hamstrung by a lack of precision munitions but this analysis is refuted daily by the many PGM strikes that are documented (heavily censored by Western media, you have to look further afield to see this information).

Approximately 40% of the 'Russian' troops in the field are made made up of the DPR/LPR militias, which are further buttressed by the Chechens and PMCs. The actual Russian army is only operating somewhere around 76 BTGs in the field with another 22 on standby/resupply. If you read my comment carefully you'll see that I was referencing a 'wartime' scenario where the Russians would mobilise reservists and volunteers. 10-15% is a conservative figure.

Re. Ukrainian casualties and surrenders, I'm not going to do your research for you, you can find daily updates from a myriad of independent analysts and researchers, many of whom are Westerners. The French, Indians and Greeks also have some decent sources. You can also look at what the propaganda outlets from Kiev and Moscow are saying and through a process of judicious factoring can ascertain roughly what is going on (for instance, Zelensky said in a briefing the other day that 50-100 Ukrainians were being killed daily in combat...he's clearly lying so you know the real number is multiples of that. By contrast the Russian MoD says that 500 AFU are big killed a day...this is likely closer to the truth but is probably exaggerated. A middle figure of 300/day would be reasonable to assume). 

Surrenders are well documented on Telegram but I'm not going to link those here. Personally I find these things very upsetting and judging by the comments on these threads there are many kids running around here. If you're smart and genuinely interested in the truth I'm sure you'll find them.",655b6bb77a14e0d3b6af227150154958aee7fd14,True,False,,,,,0,1653274641,,0,{},i9n29qq,False,t3_t020va,False,True,t1_i9jncjk,/r/geopolitics/comments/t020va/russia_invasion_of_ukraine_live_thread/i9n29qq/,1653274651,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1653245841.0
