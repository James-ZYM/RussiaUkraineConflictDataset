CTRL - F ""invasion"". Blockade is portrayed as a secondary threat. 

&gt;For example, the United States and allies may need more capacity and resilience to wage economic warfare against China in the event of a Chinese blockade of Taiwan or other major disruption to international trade.

Yes, and most of those are folks who work in technical fields.

https://www.ft.com/content/a4e8de3b-a2aa-4f10-a820-a910274175a8?shareType=nongift

	The director of the CIA said that Chinese president Xi Jinping has been “unsettled” by the war in Ukraine, which had demonstrated that the friendship between Beijing and Moscow had “limits” at a time when western allies were moving closer together.

Speaking at the FT Weekend Festival in Washington on Saturday, Bill Burns said the “bitter experience” of the first 10 to 11 weeks of the conflict had come as a surprise to the Chinese leadership and may be affecting its calculations with respect to Taiwan.

“It strikes us . . . that Xi Jinping is a little bit unsettled by the reputational damage that can come to China by the association with the brutishness of Russia’s aggression against Ukrainians [and] unsettled certainly by the economic uncertainty that’s been produced by the war,” Burns said, adding that Xi’s “main focus” was on “predictability”.

He added that China was also dismayed by “the fact that what Putin has done is driving Europeans and Americans closer together” and was looking “carefully at what lessons they should draw” for Taiwan.

“I don’t for a minute think that it’s eroded Xi’s determination over time to gain control over Taiwan,” although it was “affecting their calculation”, Burns said.

Burns said Xi’s China was the “biggest geopolitical challenge we face over the long term as a country”, even though the threat from Putin’s Russia could not be underestimated.

“[Putin] demonstrates in a very disturbing way that declining powers can be at least as disruptive as rising one,” Burns said.

Burns spoke after Biden administration officials sought to play down reports that US intelligence officials had helped Ukraine target and kill Russian generals on the battlefield and sink the Moskva, a Russian ship in the Black Sea.

“It is irresponsible, it’s very risky, it’s dangerous when people talk too much. Whether it’s leaking in private or talking in public about specific intelligence issues,” Burns said.

The CIA director, a former senior diplomat in previous US administrations, added that it would be a “big mistake” to underestimate Ukraine’s own intelligence capabilities.

“This is their country. They have a lot more information than we do and a lot more intelligence than we in the US and amongst our allies do,” he added.

Burns said Putin remained undeterred to keep pressing ahead with the war, saying the second phase of the conflict as it shifted to the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine was “at least as risky” or “even riskier” than the first phase where Russia failed to gain control of Kyiv, the capital.

“[Putin] is in a frame of mind in which he doesn’t believe he can afford to lose; so the stakes are quite high in this phase,” Burns said. “I think he’s convinced right now that doubling down . . . will enable him to make progress.”

The CIA director said that even though US intelligence did not see “practical evidence” that Russia was planning to deploy tactical nuclear weapons, “we can’t take lightly those possibilities” given Russia’s sabre-rattling.",c136524a331c79ec9d5d8233c06b7c150bf5a544,True,False,,,,,0,1651962713,,0,{},i7qanca,False,t3_ukbt1m,False,True,t3_ukbt1m,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ukbt1m/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_07_2022/i7qanca/,1651962725,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651933913.0,

However, in my world view, it seems horrible how they act and fight. However, I come from a world, where war is a detached affair, and once it's over we can get back to *real* soldiering.  Where staff work, and paperwork is paramount. , where there's online training. Where a move over is 100 pages long for an administrative move. So, my view is different.

***Those soldiers in Mariupol were not wasted. Not in the slightest.*** 

I remember learning one day from a platoon warrant officer about the defense, I was fresh, new, still months from even going on my basic officer's course. He was explaining the defense to me, and fire planning, the role of the FOO and final protective fires. 

I asked him. *""So then you withdraw right?""*  
*""No, you don't.""*

*""What do you do?""*

*""You keep fighting.""*

Hard lesson for an 18 year old who grew up reading everything about the military, watching all the films, playing all the games.  Until that time, I thought you held a position until overwhelmed then made your escape. Not that you fight until it's over over and you're dead, wounded, a prisoner or beat them back. Those are your orders, that's what you have to do.

They still hold their position, they tie down enemy forces, they cause the enemy to divert troops, manpower, materiel and resources, to consume ammunition, fuel, water food to try to take them out. They also provide an insecure flank to the enemy's advance. 

They also provide heroes, and countries need those. They need those symbols to rally around.  Medals, flags, tokens, pictures, people, stories. Those keep people going as much as other things, as much as physical things. They set the bar for what *can* be done. 

Sometimes, it goes well, and you win, and get medals. Sometimes you don't, and sometimes you die. It's part of what you sign up for. It's sad, but true.  Sometimes there is impossible situations, the no-win scenario. 

Another brief story. Learning Urban Operations, how to clear rooms.

*""So, the first man in the stack is dead. You will kick him down and walk over him through the doorway.""*   

It's a violent profession. It's a gruesome profession really. We still clear rooms, you can't use a Carl Gustav to mousehole, or just throw grenades from the outside all the time anymore. Yet it still has to be done. It was one of the big, clearest lectures I remember was them explaining that we had the responsibility to order people to die as future officers. 

As for the Russian's current operational planning. I am of the opinion that they expected a lot less resistance, and the political situation to fall into their favour. I also believe that they thought a quick coup-de-main attempt by a small force would work, and that they would have a large amount of public support. That Ukrainian forces would shy away. When that failed, they were bogged down.

Now, they have changed their strategic objectives, and are attempting to force a battle in the South East. My guess is they feel that they can encircle the forces there, to force a peace deal, or weaken the force, that there is insufficient forces that could break an encirclement.

The problem is, they lack the depth of forces to really push forward in a large set-piece encirclement.",3bd4693661af28c19ec4b22c3f9d81f715eac521,True,False,,,,,0,1651961630,,0,{},i7q8ct5,False,t3_ukbt1m,False,True,t1_i7q4mep,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ukbt1m/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_07_2022/i7q8ct5/,1651961645,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651932830.0,

Very detailed run down on all the differences in availabilities and how much of a shock it would be, I hope that some how something like this is explored in media or a war podcast that explains and discusses this stuff.


I think the Ukrainian army has done amazingly well and will do even better as they get more equipment and training and have ha dmonents of brilliance especially over the years when they were basically David vs Goliath while not getting any help and Russia had impunity.

But I do concede that the army has had it’s disgraceful moments. They do tend to let their soldiers down in some ways at some key moments.

Like for example the whole Mariupol thing, people can acknowledge the bravery and. Incredible feat of holding out for so long, but it is ultimately a waste of men and materiel.

They tend to just kind of hold up their hands and say what the hell when soldiers get encircled.

The Russians were psychotic in their massacring of the surrendered Ukrainians and ilovaisk and debaltseve but a big issue is the huge controversy over how the general staff conducted themselves over it and how they didn’t do much for the troops while they were encircled.

It’s probably a big reason why Russians want to encircle them in the Donbass. They know that it would decisively crush them and send a big shockwave through the government and cause controversy.

Whenever the soldiers get encircled they just seem to leave them there and not do anything and just .take the troops as lost and hope they fight out of it.

It’s why I’m so glad the Ukrainians have held on and they’re getting long rage outranging far more accurate artillery. I hope they will break the Russians.

Because if the Russians broke them I think it would be gg, they’d encircle and try annihilate the troops but they’d jus keep pushing forward in the ensuing pandemonium and shattered morale.

A U.N. statement. In its first unanimous action on the Ukraine war, the United Nations Security Council adopted a statement expressing “deep concern” about the conflict and “strong support” for diplomatic efforts by the U.N. secretary general to find a peaceful solution. The adopted text appeared to have averted Russia’s veto by referring to the conflict as “disputes” rather than “war.”

The Russians, he said, had not even bothered to court him, they only leveled demands. He said Moscow took the same approach to other politicians in Ukraine’s east. “They didn’t even try to convince us,” he said. “They just thought we would be, a priori, on their side.”

On the eve of the war, Mr. Vilkul was most likely the Russian-leaning politician in Ukraine with the broadest popular support. “I was alone on this level,” he said. He was also viewed by Moscow as a promising potential convert to its side when it invaded Ukraine.

That’s when the call came to Mr. Vilkul’s cellphone from Vitaly Zakharchenko, a Ukrainian in exile in Russia who had served as interior minister under Mr. Vilkul in Mr. Yanukovych’s government. He recommended Mr. Vilkul cooperate with the Russians.

“I told him to get lost,” Mr. Vilkul said. “I didn’t even consider it.”

Mr. Vilkul said he had been misunderstood — by Russia’s leadership and his nationalist opposition at home. A great-grandfather, he said, had fought White Russians in the civil war. The Vilkul family, he said, “has been fighting Russians on this land for a hundred years.”

The Kremlin, he said, had misinterpreted his respect for World War II veterans and support for rights of Russian speakers as potential support for a renewed Russian empire, something he said was a mistake. He called the Russians “classic megalomaniacs.”

“They mistook common language and values like attitudes to the Second World War and Orthodoxy as a sign that somebody loves them,” he said.

A second offer, this time presented publicly by another Ukrainian exile, Oleh Tsaryov, in a post on Telegram, came about a week later, when Russian troops had advanced to within six miles of the city. “My fellow party members and I have always taken a pro-Russian stance,” the post said, referring to Mr. Vilkul and his father, and added ominously that “cooperation with the Russian army means preserving the city and lives.”

Mr. Vilkul responded with an obscene post on Facebook.

On the first days of the invasion, Mr. Vilkul ordered the region’s mining companies to park heavy equipment on the runway of the city’s airport, thwarting an airborne assault, and on approach roads, slowing tank columns. The tires were then popped and engines disabled.

The city’s steel industry began to turn out tank barriers and plates for armored vests. Mr. Zelensky, whose hometown is Kryvyi Rih, appointed Mr. Vilkul military governor of the city on the third day of the war, though the two had been political opponents in peacetime.

Mr. Vilkul has taken to wearing fatigues and a camouflage bandanna. A parade of Ukrainian nationalists, including the leader of the Right Sector paramilitary, Dmytro Yarosh, and a prominent activist and military officer, Tetiana Chernovol, once sworn enemies of the Vilkul family, have shown up in his office to shake his hand.

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/07/world/europe/russia-putin-ukraine-politicians.html

KRYVYI RIH, Ukraine — The solicitation to commit treason came to Oleksandr Vilkul on the second day of the war, in a phone call from an old colleague.

Mr. Vilkul, the scion of a powerful political family in southeastern Ukraine that was long seen as harboring pro-Russian views, took the call as Russian troops were advancing to within a few miles of his hometown, Kryvyi Rih.

“He said, ‘Oleksandr Yurivich, you are looking at the map, you see the situation is predetermined,’” Mr. Vilkul said, recalling the conversation with a fellow minister in a former, pro-Russian Ukrainian government.

“Sign an agreement of friendship, cooperation and defense with Russia and they will have good relations with you,” the former colleague said. “You will be a big person in the new Ukraine.”

The offer failed spectacularly. Once war had begun, Mr. Vilkul said, the gray area seeped out of Ukrainian politics for him. Missiles striking his hometown made the choice obvious: He would fight back.

“I responded with profanity,” Mr. Vilkul said in an interview.

If the first months of the war in Ukraine became a military debacle for the Russian army — deflating the reputations of its commanders and troops in a forced retreat from Kyiv — the Russian invasion also highlighted another glaring failure: Moscow’s flawed analysis of the politics of the country it was attacking. The miscalculation led to mistakes no less costly in lives for the Russian army than the faulty tactics of tank operators who steered into bogs.

The Kremlin entered the war expecting a quick and painless victory, predicting that the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky would fracture and that leading officials in the largely Russian-speaking eastern region would gladly switch sides. That has not happened.

The political myopia was most significant in the country’s east, political analysts say.

In all but a tiny number of villages, Russia failed to flip local politicians to its side. The Ukrainian authorities have opened 38 cases of treason, all targeting low level officials in individual instances of betrayal.

“Nobody wanted to be part of that thing behind the wall,” said Kostyantyn Usov, a former member of Parliament from Kryvyi Rih, referring to Russia’s isolated, authoritarian system.

He said that system had dismal appeal in Ukraine and noted the absence of widespread collaboration with Russia, including among Ukrainians who speak Russian and share the country’s cultural values.

“We are part of something bright,” he said of Ukraine. “It is here, with us, in our group. And they have nothing to offer.”

Other prominent, once Russian-leaning politicians including Ihor Terekhov, the mayor of Kharkiv, and Hennady Trukhanov, the mayor of Odesa, also remained loyal and became fierce defenders of their cities.

Along with leaders in the southeast, Ukrainian people also resisted. Street protests against occupation in Kherson continue despite lethal dangers for participants. One man stood in front of a tank. Kryvyi Rih’s miners and steelworkers have shown no signs of pivoting allegiance to Russia.

“Before the war, we had ties to Russia,” said Serhiy Zhyhalov, 36, a steel mill engineer, referring to familial, linguistic and cultural bonds. But no longer, he said. “No one has any doubts that Russia attacked us.”

Ukraine’s southeastern regions, an expanse of steppe and blighted industrial and mining cities, is now the focus of fighting in the war.

Driving south from Kyiv, the highway leaves behind the dense pine forests and reedy swamps of northern Ukraine, and the landscape opens into expansive plains. Farm fields stretch out to the horizons, in brilliant, yellow blossoming rapeseed or tilled black earth.

In many ways, the region is entwined with Soviet and Russian history. The iron and coal industries shaped southeastern Ukraine. In and around the city of Kryvyi Rih are iron ore deposits; the coal is farther east, near the city of Donetsk.

The two mineral basins, known as the Kryvbas and the Donbas, gave birth to a metallurgical industry that drew in many nationalities from around the Czarist and Soviet empires from the late 19th century onward, with Russian becoming the lingua franca in the mining towns. Villages remained mostly Ukrainian speaking.

The region for years elected Russian-leaning politicians such as Mr. Vilkul, a favorite villain to Ukrainian nationalists for promoting Soviet-style cultural events that angered many Ukrainians. He staged, for example, a singalong party in Kryvyi Rih to belt out “Katyusha,” a Russian song associated with the Soviet World War II victory.

More substantively, Mr. Vilkul ascended in politics under the former, pro-Russian president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, in whose government he served as deputy prime minister until street protesters deposed Mr. Yanukovych in 2014.

Much of the rest of Mr. Yanukovych’s cabinet fled with him to Russia. But Mr. Vilkul remained in Ukraine as a de facto political boss of Kryvyi Rih while his aging father served as the city’s mayor.

And he caught Moscow’s eye. In 2018, Mr. Vilkul said in the interview, he was told through an intermediary that “the time of chaos is over” and that he should now follow orders from Moscow if he wished to remain in politics in the southeast. He said he refused.

Victory Day concerns. President Volodymyr Zelensky called on citizens to heed local curfews in the face of an increasing threat of Russian attacks. Officials in the country fear that President Vladimir V. Putin might use Russia’s Victory Day holiday on May 9 to ratchet up fighting and turn what he calls a “special military operation” in Ukraine into explicit, all-out war.

**That's the thing.** 

The mentality in the west is, different when it comes to war. How we look at combat, how we look at deployments and operations. When was the last really serious, deadly conflict any of the NATO countries has engaged in? 1982? 

The gulf had a lot of scary contingency planning - For example it was thought if 4 CMBG was deployed from Europe, we'd have 150% causalities within 30 days. That's 6000 dead and wounded.  That there would be slaughter on the first day of ground conflict on the scale not seen since the somme. 

Now a days, it's a very clinical, sterile and detached affair. You deploy, you're in a giant base with all the comforts of home, hot showers, Tim Horton's, cell phones, video calls. If mom gets sick, you're on a flight home the next day on emergency leave. Add in the massive pay increase for deployments...21 days leave, 30 days debarkation leave for a 6 month stint. Hell, if you didn't want to commit to 6 months, there's always ways to wrangle yourself onto Staff Advisory visits and quick deployments in theatre. (My former parish priest was also our unit padre and managed to get a few stints in Afghanistan/Camp Mirage.) (I also remember some courts martials trying to get over there to 'examine the evidence')

Then there's the gear, you have really top of the line everything, from rifles, to optics, to satellite phones, to boots, to rucksacks. You even can buy your own stuff and get it there with Amazon. Equipment, munitions, everything is lavished upon you. Who remembers Chieftan's YouTube video where he said for OIF his tank crew had a M249, a shotgun, an AT4, 4 pistols, 4 carbines? For 4 people.  

  
***What a lot of people expect Ukraine to be like:*** 

A downed aircrew, expect a rescue operation that makes BAT21 look tiny. 

Patrol in trouble, the airborne QRF and ground borne is coming in with all the fire power, all of a sudden there's everything from gunships, to B52s and space lasers giving you protective fire. 

Need to go on patrol, raid or ambush? Here's every imaging device known to man, every gizmo, gadget and thing to make it that much more effective.  To hell with emcon! The technology gap in personal equipment is lightyears ahead in your favour.

Someone firing off artillery, off to engineer prepared defensive positions while as above, the target is dealt with.

Someone got shot? Well they are wearing so much armour they can't go prone, we're going to hold the attack, get a medevac in, they are going to be in a role 3 within 30 minutes. The medics will have all the gear to replace everything on you. Within the week you're at home next to your sick mom a hero while getting full rehabilitation. Oh, we'll hold the attack, you don't even have to worry about being carried back eventually to the platoon warrant and company sergeant major's collecting points, they'll clear a LZ 50 meters away from you to make it that much quicker. No dingy Medical platoon and ambulance ride to a field hospital either. 

Enemy force in strength? Ah we can use all kinds of tools first, deploy armour, helos, everything.  Then we'll eventually get on the ground, don't worry, you don't need bayonets anymore. 

It's raining? Look at my Goretex everything and tent. It's perfect. Look at my nice air conditioned Stryker/LAV/Warrior/MRAP, we even got a cooler of coke with us.  Your pants ripped, don't worry you'll have a spare one from the CQ in a few hours. *Need some more ration packs, take three!*

Long day? Off to get some burger king, watch a movie, look at some porn, count down how many days until home leave or redeployment and repeat. 

The countdown starts the second you land in theatre, it's N days until your leave, and you'll be pulled from combat and put on the bird out, then Y days until you're back home a hero. None of this for the hostilities nonsense, none of this managed readiness or rotation nonsense. 

A lot of what is going on in Ukraine needs to be a wake up call to the western forces. There's been a lot of complacency since 2000. I remember in 2005, learning that they were not going to be teaching trenching and digging fighting positions to new troops, that it was going to be based on defending a FOB. I was like, what? (I was 19 then, and I realized then it was a bad idea. ).

Also, I want to make a point. A lot of people say they are 'special forces'. Some are, walter-mitties. However, some are using a generous interpretation of the truth. If you're a cook assigned to the SAS Regiment, well you've ""**Served with** **^(the)** **special forces**"".  It's word play.  Also, who said you needed to be a fitness stud the rest of your life once you leave either? I say this more as a reaction to reality, it's like reading someone's resume. 

As for slamming the Ukrainian military, let's just say, I'm appalled with how they are conducting this war and their personnel policies. 

Their complaints are valid. Remember, the ethos of soldiering in the west is so much different now. I personally look at the Ukrainian army as some rabble trying to pretend to be an army. It's my view of them. It's a view *coloured* by my experiences as a ~~uniformed civil servan~~t, I mean officer, on how the profession of arms '***should***' work.  It's the **philosophy, history** and **culture**, and **mentality** differences.  *Good god, watching a training video from Ukraine. How they cock their weapons on load command, what the hell is that?* 

So to a lot of westerners, they essentially have flown to Mars when they landed. It's not Iraq, or Afghanistan, or a UN deployment. Yes, those people have fought, and seen combat, and action, and been in the suck. Yes, The early UN rotos in Bosnia I think were some of the worst experiences known to man to those troops who went over, and I met my fair share.  However, it's a different world in Ukraine today, a war we haven't seen in a long time.  

The military does institutionalize you. The same as many other places. For those coming from the west, they are not going to a different branch, they are going into a different industry. Things don't work the same as when I was on the USS/HMS LASTSHIP or with the Loamshires, or when I was in Iraq/Afghanistan/Iraq.

Their complaints are understandable when you look at it from a perspective of culture and institutionalization.",74319d364086d807507d707d63d651f682948554,True,False,,,,,0,1651952369,,0,{},i7po6wc,False,t3_ukbt1m,False,True,t1_i7otz7p,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ukbt1m/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_07_2022/i7po6wc/,1651952382,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651923569.0,

&gt;Or are they being given weapons and sent to 'hold the line and defend donbas'? Contextually there's surely a big difference.

Given the front line is 10km from Donetsk City Centre... thats more or less the same thing. But, again, according to multiple accounts surfacing they are being sent to the front and are fighting Ukranian units.

&gt;As alluded to in the above comment, Ukrainian men aren't even allowed to leave the country (which I think is ridiculous) so if its the latter then I struggle to see a significant difference

The significance is tehre are 22 million Ukranian men.... and something on the order of 12m of them 18-55.....and so far, aside from the conscripts who were involved in their standard national service at the start of the conflict, they have called up recruits and volunteers that are a tiny percentage of those millions. 

Every male 18-55 in LPR/DPR is being forcibly consctipted. This is a long way from recruiting 200,000 ex-servicemen and volunteers from your 12m or so manpower pool.

[],False,,TermsOfContradiction,,,[],,,,text,t2_4doeu,False,False,"I enjoyed reading this article because directly addresses the major security challenges we face today. The aggressive incrementalism used by Russia to expand on its western borders to the loss of its neighboring nations. And the actions by China in the South China Sea to seize and secure islands to a level and speed closely matched to avoid a military confrontation with its neighbors and he US. 

Even the talk about tactical nuclear weapons, and their potential to be used at a level below the threshold for massive retaliation is applicable to examining Salami Tactics. I do not fault the author for not including this issue however as it would not have contributed to his narrow focus needed to highlight this issue.

The example of the US slowly slicing Florida away from Spain while they feared losing their weak grip on their empire in the Americas, was illuminating to me as I had not studied that period in US history. 

The author does make a strange error when he says that the actions in Georgia and Ukraine were to avoid potential US military retaliation. As as far as I can see it there was no possibility of the US getting involved militarily in either case, and the US explicitly said so in both cases. But the point remains the same as the level of conflict was deliberately kept low enough in both circumstances for Russia to accomplish its territorial aims, while avoiding a wider conflict that would accrue much larger economic and military costs. 

----------------

&gt; * Unlike more direct efforts to achieve a decisive victory, salami tactics capitalize on the adversary’s short time horizons and incentives to avoid war, even at the risk of long-term decline.15

&gt; * Salami tactics fail when they spark unanticipated costly retaliation, for instance through a misjudgment of how much the adversary values the target or by provoking a demonstration of resolve.16

&gt; * Fourth, salami tactics involve the prospect of repeat predation. 

&gt; * To be clear, salami tactics are a policy (not an outcome), so the concept does not require multiple successful faits accomplis.

&gt; * Salami tactics represent a common, if understudied, approach to international competition. For example, China has recently expanded its influence in the South China Sea not by conquest, negotiation, or arbitration, but through “demonstrative” actions like patrols and construction projects that have unilaterally changed day-to-day realities in and around the Spratly archipelago.17 Russia has behaved similarly, not only separating Abkhazia and South Ossetia from Georgia, and Crimea from Ukraine, but subtly expanding border fences in Georgia, extending provocative military flights over Eastern Europe, and moving to control Arctic natural resources.18 In each case, the altering of situations on the ground has forced neighbors and their allies to respond in the shadow of potential escalation.

&gt; * Wars receive the lion’s share of scholarly attention, but expansion via subtler means is far more common than many realize. In a recent article, Dan Altman found that states have been roughly nine times more likely to gain territory by fait accompli than by coercive threat since World War I.22 As he and Ahmer Tarar have argued, such findings imply that international security scholars should complement bargaining models of war with greater attention to faits accomplis.23 This section offers an important step in that direction, walking through the logic and implications of a new model of salami tactics (presented in Appendix I).

&gt; * Therefore, a state pursuing salami tactics has a strong incentive to portray its actions as normatively legitimate and its ambitions as explicitly limited in order to provide rhetorical ammunition for doves advocating acquiescence within the rival government.

&gt; * As Schelling wrote, “One tests the seriousness of a commitment by probing it in a noncommittal way, pretending the trespass was inadvertent or unauthorized if one meets resistance, both to forestall the reaction and to avoid backing down.”34

&gt; * U.S. leaders sought to irreversibly dissolve Spanish authority in Florida through local rebellions backed by external intervention. In 1810, Madison sent William Wykoff to incite popular uprisings in West Florida, instructing Mississippi Governor David Holmes to prepare militia to occupy the area “in the event of either foreign power interference with West Florida, or of internal convulsions.”59 Rebels seized the Spanish fort at Baton Rouge that September, and Madison announced its unilateral annexation one month later.60

&gt; * With no feasible path to reversing the U.S. faits accomplis, Spanish leaders signed away Florida, despite recognizing U.S. conduct as “Machiavellian.”70

&gt; * Russia’s salami tactics displayed all five of the model’s conditions, enabling it to seize territory in Georgia and Ukraine while avoiding potential U.S. military retaliation. 

&gt; * Nuclear weapons are not necessary for salami tactics (as the Florida case showed), but their possession by an aggressor may nevertheless facilitate small-scale faits accomplis by ensuring that escalation entails maximal risk.

&gt; * Putin also sought to legitimize the annexation by a local referendum that reported 97 percent in favor, with 83 percent voter turnout (though it included no status quo option and a gaffe by Putin’s Human Rights Council revealed actual results of only 50–60 percent in favor with 30 percent turnout).110 

&gt; * With military retaliation deterred, the primary costs of annexing Crimea were diplomatic and economic.

&gt; * Increasing the upfront costs of aggression is also central to deterring salami tactics. Visibly signaling security commitments and conducting joint military exercises can help to reassure allies and deter attacks, but threats of military retaliation ultimately still rely on the defender’s will to intervene post hoc.131

&gt; * Finally, undercutting aggressors’ visions of cascading expansion depends on clear, consistent, and credible signaling.136 Even a superpower may represent a flimsy deterrent to an aggressor that can reasonably question its will to act.

&gt; * Of course, therein lies the dilemma: Salami tactics are most likely to be used to target peripheral interests where the adversary may simply not wish to make those investments.141 The devil remains in the details — just as salami tactics exploit the gap between the cost of retaliation and interests at stake, effective deterrence depends on cost-effective denial measures and credible modes of punishment.

Many of the ones that duck and ran were before this huge donbass battle. Tens of them fled to Poland just because of one missile strike and the idiot was posting on reddit shamelessly for more attention claiming “ the Ukrainian officers are crazy” “they’re going to be *killed*” “they want us to go to Kyiv and fight!” The moron showed his delusion saying “ I just expected to be setting up ambushes on tanks” “I didn’t expect air strikes”

( like he didn’t think a tank round or no auto cannon is more dangerous doing an ambush).

They don’t have real commitment just want instant gratification to go over take photos and talk to the media about what a hero they are and then maybe spend a few weeks and then leave whenever they feel like so they can claim glory the rest of their lives. Maybe they’d stay longer if  the combat is low intensity and they aren’t in much danger but as soon as they see they can readily be killed and it’s a real war they run, like the dude ran to Poland immediately then started smearing Ukrainians.

That’s not even getting into not delusional war tourists but the straight up dangerous types, the Walter Mitty types that are totally lying about their history.

I think that’s the impression some got they didn’t realise how serious and bloody the war would be and that means many casualties. 

I mean if one missile strike before people have even actually gone to Kyiv let alone donbass can send “former special forces” packing and running home it tells you a lot. And I’m sure the Ukrainian recruiters have put up with a lot of bullshit and have learned to sort the serious people from the idiots.

These people faced the absolute worst, they went up against Russian regulars for years while the world wasn’t helping them, nordstream 2 was still going ahead.

There was spetsnaz, Russian regular units and security services in the country and Russian troops shelling them across the border with impunity and still they fought.


Do you know why I am sure they are right. It happened quite early on.

People need to look up “Walter Mitty” it’s fantasists that want to be war heroes. You actually saw a lot of that in Syria, people would turn up, soak up the cameras and accept glory but they’d never commit. They often had bad pasta like criminal histories or failure to thrive.

But as soon as they got asked to actually fight and take risks they get cold feet. Many would only stay for weeks at most a month or two.

It happened very early on. A guy on reddit went there claiming to be a combat vet and as soon as the missile strike happened him and several others immediately left the country...

They didn’t even engage in one battle and they immediately fled to the safety of Poland. He did this with no shame.. why? Because they’re man children who need clinical help.

And when they do this they don’t have shame.

He was up in the volunteers sub smearing the entire Ukrainian army. He was saying the “officers are crazy” and “ they wanted us to go fight in Kyiv even after the missile strike”.


That’s their ego and rationalisation. They never would have committed and fought but they always do that, they turn 180 degrees and smear the people they said they were loyal to. They’re also shameless enough to again **run back to the media and take interviews but this time they start criticising the Ukrainians claiming they “ sent them on suicide missions”**.


But in the guys comments on the post you saw how much of a manchild he was. He was saying stuff like “ I thought we’d just set up ambushes in tanks” “I didn’t expect there to be air strikes”.

As if running up to a t72 or even a IFV with a huge auto cannon isn’t more risky!

These people would never actually commit, they want glory and to be the hero who “.mjust has to do something” but don’t want to actually have to fight.

It was an embarrassment, there was even another guy who left before even being in Ukraine one day. He wanted to be able to leave at any time saying “if I say my mom is sick can I go back to america”. Like wtf, they’ll never force you but they aren’t going to invest in you and die alongside you when you want to duck out at a moments notice likely before even battling, for all they know you could be a spy or harm more than help.

I’m not saying all people that go there are like this. I’ve seen videos of some hard fighting international volunteers, many who haven’t been on social media. Like an American girl
being a combat medic and she was cool as a cat under shell fire.

But some of the others who come are just w mockery and they likely saw many of them.

I’m sorry but sizeable proportion of the claimed “former special forces” were simply fat old men who day dream too much.

I can’t speak on Wali because obviously he did fight, but you see he left when he felt like it and he did get a lot of social media spotlight and media glory, it’s like that for the fantasists except worse ( not wali) they go there, do interviews, social media posts, then immediately plan when to leave. 

Some may just be misguided who thought it would be like Afghanistan where you have air supremacy and take pot shots then call in some heavy fire / airstriked that does it for you.

But it’s interesting as the guy who left on reddit smeared the Ukrainians, called their heroic officers “crazy” and anyone who stayed “not got their heads together” and while he was stroking his ego telling himself he’s volunteering in the brothels in krakow.. the Ukrainians and the real volunteers forced the Russians from Kyiv and out of Ukraine and secured the existence of the Ukrainian state.",39093e0e04209ac309e3d8fba34819e4a7f210f0,True,False,,,,,0,1651938898,,0,{},i7otz7p,False,t3_ukbt1m,False,True,t1_i7om2e1,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ukbt1m/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_07_2022/i7otz7p/,1651938912,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651910098.0,

Because they’ve been raining hundreds of thousands of dumb artillery rounds on Ukrainians in donbass to make up for their inability to fight as well on them in infrantrt tactics.

They might have points sometimes that potential is being wasted, but I don't think any of these people adequately account for the fact that there is a war of survival going on and sometimes their own small segment that they see is not the main priority. It is like they think Ukrainians should drop everything to ensure they can carry out daring missions rather than the reality of tedious but necessary stuff.

2. Ukraine ran out of ammo.

3. Many tb-2 were shot down, the Ukrainian high command took a pause in using them to come up with a new, different tactic for employing them.

My hypothesis is that the reality is a combination of the 3.

I am sorry, but your ""most logical reason"" is in fact not all that logical, or to be more precise: not nearly as obvious as you put it.

Russia managing to shoot down dozens of TB-2s with sparing video evidence of any such success starting to come in only in April, succeeding to a degree as to provide zero instances of success for Ukraine (i.e complete lack of videod strikes) is a VERY big claim, requiring a lot of assumptions being true.

I am not going to claim that I know what is the reason, but since you like you Occam, I will present you two opposing hypothesis.

1) Russia managed to shoot down almost all TB-2s over a 1,5 month period, completely eliminating Ukrainian success.

What this requires: dozens of successful strikes, catching Ukrainian TB-2s inside Russian AD, managing to target those drones, shoot and hit them. Across all fronts, over a 1,5 month period. Obviously not impossible, but there is a lot of stuff that needs to happen for this.

2) Ukrainian high command decided (for whatever reason) not to publish TB-2 strikes for 1,5 months.

You do the best you can at getting supplies to problem areas when they pop up,  but when 4, 5 and 6 start popping up at once, you start having to prioritize.  You hit the first few and know that you might miss 5 and 6 if youre too slow. 

So on the ground that means ""holy shit, we'll be out of ammo tomorrow!""  but the trucks come in tomorrow morning and it gets there just in time, hopefully.

It could be that the VDV disengaged but tbh given the lack of evidence makes me surmise that what likely happened is the VDV landed taking relatively limited losses (a couple of ka 52 and a couple of Mi 8 troops carriers which sounds bad but consider that over 40 helicopters were travelling over hostile ground with an determined opponent with modern AA systems and manpads). The troops secured the airfield. The UA seem to have mobilised to skirmish with the Russians. UA air support came in to hit the VDV. 

What happened next we can't really definitively say. Maybe there was a battle, maybe not. Captured Russians (taken after the relief column arrived) does not suggest that there was a major battle. However it cannot be discounted. 

At some point VDV travelling on the ground seem to have broken through UA lines to relieve the VDV.

The issues for the VDV seem, please note I'm using seem/may as I don't know for sure, to have run into issue as they were then left in place as the other columns didn't reach Kyiv in numbers. So the VDV were used to try and take e.g. Irpen, Hostomel and Bucha which they were utterly unequipped to do. They also were left in positions exposed to exceptional UA artillery which decimated the VDV.

- Merriam Webster 

*Shaped charges are devices in which an explosive load is used to collapse a (usually metal) liner, thereby creating a high velocity jet that is capable of penetrating deep into metal, concrete or other target materials (Walters &amp; Zukas, 1989).* 

- Science Direct

*A shaped charge is a concave metal hemisphere or cone (known as a liner) backed by a high explosive, all in a steel or aluminum casing. When the high explosive is detonated, the metal liner is compressed and squeezed forward, forming a jet whose tip may travel as fast as 10 kilometers per second.*

Armchair claims that because T-80U is used by both sides of the conflict, somehow it needs to be clear that the T-80U was originally Russian, and then uses that to 'debunk' most of Oryx's lists. Well, here's a very simple thought process for you:

What Ukrainian soldier would be heartless enough to pose happily with essentially a tomb of one of their comrades, smile and post it on the internet?

So you stick them in their own front line unit, a bunch of dudes with different, though hopefully similar training in NATO militaries. They look around confused wondering where the air support is, since that's a foundational element of western doctrine.

Hopefully they aren't given any tasks that require them to coordinate with other units, because then the language barrier and training mismatch will pop up again.

And after someone presents you with a huge wall of his most idiotic tweets that have now been abundantly clear to see were completely wrong, you decide to call it ""arts and crafts"". There has never been anybody in this conflict who has proven to be as consistently wrong as this guy. Can you even post one take from him which hasn't proven to be completely wrong? Like, are you a real person, or are you the tweeter in question just LARPing on reddit? 

But OK, let's go through his analysis. I've done it before and commented on his tweets but of course all he's done is ignored me.

*2. It's a still from a tiktok video. Original video is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/t3xlig/ukrainian_bmp1_destroyed_what_seems_to_be_a_bmp3/).

*3. Again, recording from a video that I can't find right now.

*5/6/7: those are very clearly BMP-3's, I don't know if the dude is fucking blind or something? 

*8: Transmission, road wheels and engine remnants look to be from BMP-3. Oryx probably got it from a telegram channel of someone reliable who has proven correct in their previous assesments before, like how armchairwarlord simply takes Russian MoD statements at face value.

*9. Not an actual objection, but seems he just listed it as such.

*11. Yes, that's a BMP-3 turret.

*14. There's 2 other photos of the same BMP, in the daytime. Is he trying to view the photo from his phone or something? I can see it fine on my PC.

*17/19/22. I now have huge concerns for armchairwarlord's eyesight. Oryx has clearly pointed to the vehicle he's talking about, drawing arrows on 22 and a huge red box for 17. Yet Armchair seems to be talking about another BMP seen in the shot, which is intact. 

*24. https://nitter.net/bearded_ruffian/status/1508763644028403716#m

You get the idea. Point is, alot of Oryx pictures are pictures from videos that Armchair doesn't seem, or is incapable of, extrapolating that it might be from other media that Oryx can't upload, and then takes it as ""GOTCHA!"". That, and he clearly doesn't know Russian armor very well, and then obsesses over paint not burning off as somehow proof that the vehicle isn't actually destroyed.

Anyway, most of the qualms are beyond facile.  ""yes this is clearly a damaged/destroyed &lt;extremely specific war machine&gt;, but how do you know this image wasn't taken in Arizona?  Anyone can get a &lt;extremely specific war machine&gt; and take an image of it that's never been on the internet before and looks like it's in Ukraine, and also of a model that's clearly damaged or destroyed"".  Most of it is just him basically pretending like someone uploading an image and clearly being the original uploader isn't an indication of who it is?

Like as a specific example of a lot of his non points, he made a big deal of this image:

https://imgur.com/a/uHQijfC

And someone was talking to me about the ""ghost of Kyiv"" image, as it's often called.

And I just asked them straight up ""so how exactly does a blurred out human in this photo discredit anything?""

And he just kinda froze up.

Because he realized it didn't mean anything.  A guy got shopped out of the image.  It's not an image of the guy, it's an image of the machine.  Nothing has changed.  But he sure did try to make a big hulaboo over it, going as far as saying it ""discredits oryx"" when like:

&gt; Taiwan is supposed to receive 250 Stinger surface-to-air missiles in phased shipments by March 2026. But ""there is certainly a risk of a delay in this year's deliveries due to changes in the international situation,"" a Ministry of National Defense official told reporters.

The island was to receive 40 of the artillery units between 2023 and 2025, but Washington informed Taiwan that delivery will be postponed to 2026 at the earliest due to ""tight"" production in the U.S.",c3fcd912d3739e66eed7b71d1a92d7ec3c6c9e4c,True,False,,,,,0,1651881983,,0,{},i7mabzo,False,t3_ujlv6d,False,True,t3_ujlv6d,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ujlv6d/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_06_2022/i7mabzo/,1651882002,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651853183.0,

Insane and misguided plans are not exactly uncommon in the history of warfare, even its very recent history, and they are especially common in autocratic or authoritarian regimes. I guess the prime example would be Japan's attack on the US in WW2, but you could point to a bunch of very strange and wishful thinking in pretty much any war you like, including Iraq or Afghanistan. 

One thing I try to keep in mind is that absolutely bizarre video of Putin humiliating the chief of the SVR, on air, who evidently wasn't quite so sure about the invasion plan as everybody else in the room. 

The funny thing is, if you had to guess the plot of the rest of the movie, just from watching that clip, you might well have guessed that a massive intelligence failure would lead to a plan that was almost purely based on wishful thinking.
