I was telling friends, family, and anyone who would listen that ""hey I think something really bad is about to happen and it's going to be the largest scale war since WWII"". I don't claim any special knowledge or anything. My interest got piqued when I saw some of the news articles coming out last fall and then I started following open source Intel people on twitter. I saw that people way smarter than me with way more knowledge and understanding of Ukraine, Russia, and of military theory were sounding the alarm that this was going to happen. 

Honestly, in the United States, most people aren't very well versed in history, especially world history. The ramifications of what Russia has done don't really register with a lot of people. They don't understand how not just in Europe, but really in the world over, wars of conquest have more or less ceased to happen since WWII. The closest I could think of is the wars that happened in Africa in the 20th century and even those were really civil wars with a bunch of other countries piling in against each other. Devastating and brutal and terrible yes, but not wars of conquest. 

If Russia were to actually succeed, it takes the global order back decades. It is absolutely paramount to global security that Russia. I don't want to see WWIII, I understand the risks of NATO sending in troops, but I think we should do everything short of that to make sure Ukraine wins. I think Russia should absolutely be a pariah state and have to stew with the consequences of their actions.

Ukraine should have had more help transitioning and getting into EU/NATO.

A conservative approach would be to regulate pharmaceutical drugs and restrict illicit drugs, and a liberal approach would be to deregulate pharmaceutical drugs and allow illicit drugs. 

It’s as simple as that. That is the difference between the two. You can apply this same thinking to many other issues, and here’s the thing, most sane people have a mixture of conservative and liberal views on different things: I don’t believe in illicit drugs being legal but I do believe in the right to abortion and body autonomy. (I’m British, and these two things are what we have currently.)

You can try to tar people with a brush, say there is no middle ground, that everything is black and white and if you’re right your fascist and if you’re left you’re communist but the reality is that in most balanced countries, most people exist within a normal distribution and only a minority exist at either tail of the curve. 

Conservatism and liberalism are two side of the centre, and only when you leave the relative sanity of Western Europe does your political compass seem to spin out of control.",15e300c0eab9ca8014a50dff738ba894eb3f6f40,True,False,,,,,0,1651965464,,0,{},i7qg7rj,False,t3_ukfhev,False,True,t1_i7q2szu,/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/ukfhev/russias_goal_physically_eliminate_5_of_ukrainians/i7qg7rj/,1651965482,1,False,True,False,RussiaUkraineWar2022,t5_5wptpp,r/RussiaUkraineWar2022,public,,0,[],,1651936664.0,,

No I’m a realist.  
Putin and dictators of every sort make their moves off who is in the White House.  

That’s not self centered thinking but realism.

One thing I have noticed about war, if your country fights (like UA is) for their freedom they tend to respect freedom more. I have a feeling NATO may jump in sooner than later and it pissed me off that the actual NAZI's are committing these war crimes. Im 46, pretty ducked up physically from a rough work life (like most people who did stupid labor work) but by God if I could go and fight just to keep some kid from dying, even if it takes my life I would be ok with it. Not a tough guy line, but my kids are grown, I have had a ok life, no worse or better than another.

But that's all you've got?!? Biden is elderly? Guess what, my friend. The only people who don't leave this world hearing their own bones cracking and rattling are those who my heart breaks for because they die young, though for you I'd make an exception.

You go ahead and worship your demagogue. Be a lemming. Go through life letting the bully do your thinking for you. Sounds like hell to me. Maybe it makes you feel powerful to follow this man who lies, cheats, steals, and gets away with it. That's sad for you. He has no honor, and since it's obviously not something you value, I'll assume you're lacking in it, too.

&gt; In the present research (N = 675), we focus on the relationship between the dark side of human personality and political orientation and extremism, respectively, in the course of a presidential election where the two candidates represent either left-wing or right-wing political policies. **Narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and everyday sadism were associated with right-wing political orientation, whereas narcissism and psychopathy were associated with political extremism.** Moreover, the relationships between personality and right-wing political orientation and extremism, respectively, were relatively independent from each other.

- [Bad News for Conservatives? Moral Judgments and the Dark Triad Personality Traits: A Correlational Study](https://philarchive.org/archive/ARVBNF)
&gt; We found eleven significant correlations between conservative \[Moral Intuition Survey\] judgments and the Dark Triad – all at significance level of p&lt;.00001 – and no significant correlations between liberal \[Moral Intuition Survey\] judgments and the Dark Triad. We believe that these results raise provocative moral questions about the personality bases of moral judgments. In particular, we propose that because the Short-D3 measures three “dark and antisocial” personality traits, **our results raise some prima facie worries about the moral justification of some conservative moral judgments**",6d6726eb2d16be7b9cb06c9c8c22b10681c150f1,True,False,,,,,0,1651958988,,0,{},i7q2szu,False,t3_ukfhev,False,True,t1_i7pyyob,/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/ukfhev/russias_goal_physically_eliminate_5_of_ukrainians/i7q2szu/,1651959004,1,False,True,False,RussiaUkraineWar2022,t5_5wptpp,r/RussiaUkraineWar2022,public,,0,[],,1651930188.0,,

Some people are progressive and like to see rapid change, and some people are conservative and like to see moderate change.

I had a heart to heart with a Croatian restaurant owner while on my honeymoon in Dubrovnik and he shared his stories of fighting for his country’s independence against Yugoslavia back in the mid 90’s. Now, he does well for himself and his restaurant was actually rented out by the Game of Thrones production team when the show was recorded there. 

Another aspect of this war that draws a lot of people towards it is the fact that the big bad Russians are invading and getting their asses kicked by the Ukrainians. I’m extremely happy Kyiv stands. The Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were asymmetrical (guerilla) and fights were sporadic. Here with this conflict in Ukraine, it’s a very symmetrical (conventional) and everything is in real-time.

&gt;All in all Germany is a country that is very susceptible to becoming totalitarian and fascist, mainly through the lack of a proper constitution based on western democratic ideals.

Did you ever read the GG? i don't think so, it is more democratic then the US:

Trump won with less votes, how is that possible in a democracy?

Teachers can't talk about sexual orientation anymore in school. (wtf?)

The US has a defacto two party system, that completely divides the country.

Funding for election campaining are donations from wealthy people and the US presidents them selfes are rich oligarchs.

If you actually read the GG you will find that it is made a cerain way to stop redicals from taking over power.

Funny. It's rarely that i see how anyone points out that most countries today turned in-to a police state owned by corporation lobbies (via politics)... which also can be described by one word - fascism, \*cough\* Italy \*cough\*. Yet, it's nationalism and automatically - Germany to blame for everything.

Anything which goes radical usually turns in-to a twisted mess. Does not mean it's bad in itself. Moderation in most things brings prosperity. 

Nationalism is just a tool, it's not bad or good it's just is. They way how it's being used is what important and when it's getting misused, abused... that's where any tool can be used for evil. Like a surgeon who knows how to treat people, but same knowledge also can be used for effective torture and crippling people.

What's the point of a country which does not care first and foremost about it's it's nation, it's citizens, it's core? Germany in this case just went from being radically nationalist in-to the opposite a spineless spirit-robbed state. It's the same kind of a mistake which was done during you know whose Reich. How is that any good?  

Cultures, nations, people... it's like a dance of colors, they can and should come closer to enrich self and others, but they should be careful not to mix **carelessly**, otherwise they risk losing everything, for all sides.

People called me radical or even racist. But i ask you, show me Asian, African, Middle East or South America countries with huge white communities? No, really, i want to know, genuinely. I understand that i am, obviously not able to tap in-to omniscience. Because from what i see - Europe is in a peril of losing it's culture and sense of self by being drowned in other cultures, while being forced to be silent about anything just to not ""offend"" anyone.

Mind you, i care less about Nationalism as an ideology or a tool, hell i don't even feel connected to humanity in any shape, way or form. I just feel like an alien here. What i can't stand though is hypocrisy, ignorance and blatant lies combined with brainwashing and unfair guilt-tripping with gaslight woven in-to this fabric of deceit and manipulation.

Have you ever painted, as in with an actual paint? Or may be sculpting with plasticine? Anyway, when everything is mixed-up together it turns in-to a colorless, greyish-brown mess without any hints of vibrancy.   
On one hand, you can get a beautiful rainbow of vibrant colors who are close with each other and flow harmonically in-to each other, but still are keeping self-integrity and uniqueness. On the other hand there is a state when everything is mixed, and is just a plain, ugly cocktail without anything special, unique or interesting in it a colorless mess, literally a grey goo.

Is it me or it reminds pretty much of the state Germany was after WW I? I guess it's just my imagination.

But whatever, people will just label anything with what government brainwashed them with to label with and move on.

I don't even know why i care about Germany in this topic so passionately. I have never visited said country nor i was born there. Yet, it intrigues me for some elusive reasons i can't express with words. I can even say - it pains me to see it in such a state.

Anyway, i am tired of all of this. Nothing will change unless your average deutsch men and women will have enough being pushed around by idiots who are still guilt tripping it's own populace, Russian puppets and just plain, old, senile idiots in government.",dc79cf929dfd7b9382a469bb75b11acd73fc1891,True,False,,,,,0,1651941370,,0,{},i7ozkcm,False,t3_ukbxft,False,True,t1_i7ouhcc,/r/RussiaUkraineWar2022/comments/ukbxft/berlin_city_authorities_have_banned_the_use_of/i7ozkcm/,1651941384,1,False,True,False,RussiaUkraineWar2022,t5_5wptpp,r/RussiaUkraineWar2022,public,,0,[],,1651912570.0,,

If you look into what the actual Russian propaganda is reportedly putting out to their own countrymen, it is easily understandable why people would be volunteering.

Imagine if the Chineese intelligence services took total control of Canada, turned them into a loyal Chinese ally practicing military maneuvers all along the US border while insisting their doing it for purely defensive practice, then the Chineese overthrow the Mexican government in a color coded revolution, install their own puppet dictator, empower one ethnic group to treat the others as second class citizens, certain regions of northern Mexico hold referendums where they vote to say they'd prefer to be governed by the US, the Mexican puppet government ignores the referendum, starts bombing civilian centers in those states as separatist fighters engage with the loyalists in the streets for years, the US launches an invasion into across the whole boarder and soon after videos get posted online by particularly radical elements of the enemy forces of US POWs being tortured to death.

Now imagine your job is to use that set of factual events and nearly total control of the narrative to convince people to volunteer, and nobody will be able to fact check anything you say because you control the media and internet censorship.

Seriously, will there be moderation in anything? They got nationalism wrong back then by being too zealous about it, it does not mean it's a bad thing though, but good luck trying to talk about it in Germany without being labeled ""nazi"" in a second.

I guess \~70+ years of massive guilt-inducment and brainwashing will do that to a nation? This is so retarded. 

Germany made one mistake. A mistake which was **systematically encouraged** by theirs neighbors, nobody stepped in when Reich annexed Austria, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Luxemburg, etc. Other big players in Europe like France and UK were happy to give away ""lesser"" countries as long as Germany did not bother them. 

Yet, Moscow Empire has nothing but history of genocide, imperialism, bullying any neighbor it can and overall a history built on blood and violence. Yet, they got away with everything for centuries? 

So now, after all the years of blaming Germany for all the sins in the world, EU got itself another impotent state. Like that was enough Germany is also festered with (ex)KGB scum and other friends of Putin like Merkel who systematically destroyed Germany as an independent state. 

I also find it sickeningly ironic how nobody bats an eye to use all the technological advanced like rocket building, medicine, etc. Nazies developed. Then there is stuff like Operation ""Paperclip"" and it's soviet analogue by two, awful, imperialistic pieces of shit no less who probably caused an equal if not more suffering!

I wonder what Bismarck would tell if he somehow magically was alive and saw Germany for what it has become.

Also the “send a text message to Russia” movement has died down by now cause everyone saw that asking Russians to have a change of heart is useless: the ones with no heart just can’t be changed and the ones with one always answer they can’t do anything. So, I say, this movement must not be stopped but it must pivot from “No to War” to “Get out in the streets and BLOW SHIT UP!” Then the ones with no heart will just get more pissed off but those other ones may get the courage to come out and blow maybe just one thing up on a Monday. Then 2 things on a Tuesday.

Right now it’s getting close to mobilization time, anxiety is super high. These people were told it was gonna be over in 3 days, and now they are being told there will be no mobilization.

I based my reply to the comment the thread began with on those two subjects - the two chants - as one might when answering an essay question. That is why my argument was binary. 

That being said, mentioning ""Fuck Biden"" and ""Fuck Putin"" in the same paragraph is nonsensical. Biden is aiding Ukrainians. Putin is providing them with violent deaths. Trump supports Putin, so it's always ironic to see a Trump supporter being opposed to Russia destroying Ukraine. It's pretty hypocritical, really.

The “cluster bombs” article is behind a paywall. 

Are you seriously comparing fighting armed separatists with Putin’s invasion? Donbas is not a sovereign, democratic territory. It’s Ukraine. The separatists do not have a right to arbitrarily assign themselves territory. This is where the fatuity of the false equivalence you’re making shines through. Ukraine is defending itself. Russia isn’t. 

Regarding pockets of far-right being a common feature in militaries, here are a few below. You can search yourself but I’m pretty sure you’ll find stuff like this for most militaries on earth.

Most of the time the republicans spend their time fighting these initiatives and we get deadlocked in nothing politics where nothing useful gets done except dramatic news headlines that lack any sort of substance or actual progress.

The last president that actually got some shit done was Barrack Obama and the republicans hated him because he was black and fought his every move(I promise you this is the truth, take it from someone who has family members who are republican and say this shit). Another thing is sad that he pushed for healthcare program but after the republicans got their hands on it, it quickly became a shell of its former self. Thank you republican assholes!  


Republicans are a one trick pony. They usually pass laws to lower taxes for the rich whilst increasing taxes for the poor and middle class. They work really hard to push theocracy in american via revising historical facts about the country. Most republicans couldn't pass a citizenship test nor could they tell you the difference between the constitution and the bill of rights. They also hate the french people even though France played a gigantic role in the american revolution.  


In my life time republicans have brought us Afghanistan and Iraq wars, violations of constitutional rights (1st, 4th, 5th and 8th amendment) and basically strengthening the domestic spying program at the NSA/etc(because 2001/911 hysteria). Increased taxes on the poor. Decreased education for the American population. Brought more hatred against immigrants and foreigners(basically your typical xenophobic bullshit). Made a mountain out of a mole hill on many issues. Promotes stupid shit like building a wall in the 21st century when Mexico isn't even our enemy or as big of a problem as they claim but it pleases the racist folks to have an idea like this which is why Trump ran with it because he knew he could get support for such a useless idea. Meanwhile Mexican cartels can just pay off border guards or LITERALLY dig tunnels under the border. Also, how can you stop drugs at the border when American's want to buy the shit? Republicans should think about solving the actual problem rather than the symptom of the problem.

I've given it some thought and there are a few reasons why this war grips me to the point that when I do almost anything I think how lucky I am because if I lived in Ukraine I couldn't.  I've become grateful for the very bed I sleep in.

First is the audacity of Russia to think they can take Ukraine just because they want it.  

The sheer brutality of the Russian army - targetting civilians from day one, all the rapes, torture, and needless deaths.  After witnessing the Russian army in WWII, General George S. Patton openly admitted that the United Nations had fought against the wrong enemy and advised, “Lets not give them time to build up their supplies. If we do, then we have had a victory over the Germans and disarmed them, but we’ve failed in the liberation of Europe; we have lost the war!”

The nerve of Putin to threaten the world with nuclear annihilation if they interfere as if we were to just sit by and watch! 
 
But mostly, it's Zelensky himself.  He showed us all what courage and bravery really mean - and he didn't take glory for himself, he showed us that Ukrainins are an exceptional people who take our values more to heart than we do and are willing to die for them.  He inspired the world and I know that the US and most other countries would not be helping now if it weren't for him.  He showed us all what a true leader can be.  This one man inspired the world.
