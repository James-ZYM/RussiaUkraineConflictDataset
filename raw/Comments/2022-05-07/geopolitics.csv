The question lasts right up till the 20th Century. England had 5 million people in 1700. Iran's territory is 12 times larger than England. 12 x 5 = 60.

Trade a small X, but get a small Y from them. OR simply refuse to trade, unless they make that small Y concession (or one of a set of Ys), but make it clear I am always available to trade if they agree to that small Y.

Small trades can grow into medium trades and can grow into larger trades, as trust increases. If someone makes a few concessions, they become more willing to make (ideally bigger) concessions in the future too, as they have primed their 'brain' into thinking that is something they 'do' now.

Ideally of course, deep down inside a few of those small Y's should be something you think can weaken them, and possibly even destroy the party you disagree with from that 'enemy' country in the long run. It shouldn't happen too quick and be too big though as they could notice, so there are downsides.

I think this is a viable strategy, because a lot of countries aren't run by truly smart long term thinking people.

Their job is to prepare their positions (with their bosses), their intelligence, and to exchange and agree to the negotiation agenda and plans with the other party (or parties) ahead of time. This is usually done by the ""lower level"" communications way ahead of the planned meetings.

The important point is that, in international politics, there is no such thing as ""one and done"". Confidence is built up over a series of meetings and discussions that might take years or decades. Sometimes it is better to have small agreements and monitor compliance and verify that both parties are holding to their end. Then the next round, more significant matters are discussed. There may be dozens of areas that allow both parties to build up that confidence. 

Successful negotiators don't go in with a ""hail mary pass"" and ""ask for the stars and maybe we'll get the moon"" - that is naive and only results in more distrust and breakdowns.

I think it was very stupid for policymakers to assume that economic growth would automatically create democracy in China but frankly I think they would've done it even if they didn't believe that because of the economic incentives. Either way this is slightly different because China is a rival to the US. This article is about seeing the world through a more realist lens and less idealistically and allying with countries we don't necessarily agree with, which I think is smart strategy in a great power competition. It was definitely a blunder to help China from a geostrategic lens, but then again we might come to see India like this in a few decades if we work with them or even the European Union, although Europe's declining relevance makes that unlikely.",09479adce7ad2a971a6bfdef05855a7077e57796,True,False,,,,,0,1651941730,,0,{},i7p0d82,False,t3_ujol5z,False,True,t1_i7ot46h,/r/geopolitics/comments/ujol5z/the_trouble_with_the_free_world_why_its_a_bad/i7p0d82/,1651941741,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1651912930.0

The pro-Ukraine side keeps bragging about US intelligence sharing which discounts the Ukrainians' own strategic and tactical prowess.

The whole posture is flawed, and in my opinion, a huge reason why so many people on both sides got everything so wrong prior to the war.  Ukrainians are the ones who protested in Maidan Square for months, they are the ones who drove Ukraine out of Kyiv, and they are the ones who used US intel to kill Russian generals and sink the Moskva.

Close, not quite. The general public *of a single state* votes for the President. According to the vote share in that state, the state government sends some electors to meet with every other state's electors. Most states instruct their electors to vote for the candidate who won the most votes in the state. Electors very rarely deviate from instructions, and some states fine such ""faithless electors.""

&gt;In India, on the other hand, most candidates (unless you win as an independent which is only a minuscule fraction of electors) have to swear their allegiance to a particular political party ""before"" elections. This is to ensure that the people know who they are voting for. If they want to switch allegiance after elections, they will need to go back to the polling booth.

Our politicians are almost always affiliated with parties, but not because of laws. The party provides a lot of money and social capital for the candidate, and it's mostly impossible to compete without that. Membership in a party is not an obligation to instate particular policies, but if you go against the party you will probably not be in it next election.

I see this term ""Hindu nationalist"" used ""liberally"" everywhere by the western media but most are clueless what exactly they are trying to say when they use that terminology. Are you trying to imply that there are extremist hindu organizations in India that are doing terrorism? If yes, I would like to read sources on that. Community clashes between hindus and muslims is nothing new and it is not related to radical Islam or hindu nationalism and more related to cultural fights and community disagreements (happening since 1947). The number of causalities due to religious violence has actually decreased over the years.

&gt;There are many other liberal democracies that do a far better job with ""liberal"" (in the bastardized sense of ""left of center"") and ""democracy"" than both India and the US.

India's main problem are economic and has nothing to do with ""liberal"" democracies. For a country that is so poverty striken and corrupt, it is surprisingly peaceful. Indians living in an economically rich country are among the most peaceful communities.

There is indeed violence in the community that includes violence against ""Muslims"" and ""Dalits"". The prime reason is that India's law and order system is bad and corrupted so it happens. But the narrative that you view is based how the media report the news. The media will say ""Dalit man killed"" but will not say ""Brahmin girl murdered"". Or ""Muslim man attacked"" but not ""Hindu man assaulted"". The selective reporting of caste and religion is quite well known here and serves a good propaganda for the western audience. 

But as a rationale human being, if you really want to know the facts, you should look at how these violence play out. In most religions riots, it is always people from both communities getting killed. Most of the attack on ""dalits"" that you read in the news are actually a result of local or personal conflicts. For example, there was a widely reported case of ""dalit man driven to suicide"". Turns out he was a student who was depressed and committed suicide due to his circumstances and the entire event was politicized like crazy. But then, there were 100s of student suicide that happened that year but none of the other were even considered worthy to be reported in newspapers, and definitely not with heading likes ""Upper caste depressed girl slits her hand"".",8ce73bca6d564f69f842f84b6d7bc873271595ec,True,False,,,,,0,1651895003,,0,{},i7mznnl,False,t3_ujol5z,False,True,t1_i7m40nd,/r/geopolitics/comments/ujol5z/the_trouble_with_the_free_world_why_its_a_bad/i7mznnl/,1651895016,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1651866203.0
