[],False,,TikiTDO,,,[],,,,text,t2_3yp3u,False,False,"So then the question becomes *why* would a country want to join NATO. It's not like countries just randomly decide, ""Hey, I want to join NATO today."" Membership in such treaties is a direct consequence of clear and immediate danger that a country feel they must deal with.

The entire point of NATO was a defense alliance against Soviet aggression. There's a lot of noise being made about how NATO wasn't dissolved with the fall of the USSR, but that brings up a key point. NATO was created to deal with a threat. If the threat was no longer there, then there would be no reason for NATO to exist. In other words, the threat posed by Russia did not dissolve in the eyes of the west. Something we've seen play out time and again over the past 15 years.

During the 90s, much of the Russian infrastructure was seized on the cheap by a group of well placed senior bureaucrats who happened to be in good a position to take advantage of their previous posts, at the expense of the remaining public. This served to push out the a significant base of academics and intellectual leaders that had previously enjoyed a good deal of prestige in the country, leading to a major brain drain as those people went to other places where their skills would be appreciated. This alone did not create the threat we see today, but it did set the stage. It ensured that Russia would not have a large pool of intelligence, cool-headed, politically minded people that would have realized how it's own actions were leading it down the road to war.

In the early 2000s, the Russian security apparatus took near full control of the political, economic, and military elements of the country. While taking control, they shifted power from previous bureaucrats that were not tied to the security apparatus, to those that were. This created an environment where all the resources of the country were now under the control of a bunch of old men whose lifetime of experience essentially revolved around USSR dominance, and conflict with the west. These are not the right people to take full advantage of the opportunities presented by the vast amount of resources Russia had at its disposal. To the contrary, this sort of environment will just least to more centralization around security concerns, which in turn is likely to cause major concern in countries that comprised the old USSR. Not only was Russia flexing its muscles, but the people in charge of such flexing were exactly the ones that were responsible for keeping control in these areas during soviet times.

There were signs of Russia preparing for conflict into the early 2000s, which as you may imagine did not inspire confidence within their neighbors. Russia chose to double down on it's so called ""national identity"" rather than attempting to better integrate with the economic, social, and military policies of western nations. What more, any success of the nations that did chose integration was mocked and belittled as ""succumbing to the west."" They were made out to be stupid for not wanting to hitch their wagon to an obviously corrupt regime that was happy to remain mired in the conflicts of the past. When faced with the option of being a poor buffer state of a failed empire, or integrating more tightly with the economic and political powerhouse of the world, what surprise is there that more nations would chose the west?

I've heard a lot of Russian people make a lot of noise about how Euromaidan was just the west pushing their agenda in Ukraine, usually backed by proof such as ""well, of course they did, why wouldn't they?"" However, few of them seem to do something as simple as comparing the trajectories of GDP growth of countries associated with Russia against the same of countries not. As a Ukrainian in the early 2010s, after seeing lackadaisical for a decade, and looking around to see western aligned countries experiencing better GDP growh, far higher quality of life, and more freedom why wouldn't you support a more western aligned government? 

The thing is, since the collapse of the USSR Russia has not and could not be the type of major threat that merits the strategic investment into running major psyops, nor the type of extensive intelligence gathering that you might have expected between the US and USSR in an earlier era. It was simply too small a player. The idea that the west had nothing better to do than to attempt to bring down Russia from within is the result of psychotic delusions of ex-USSR intelligence agents trying to cling to their previous glory. In reality Russia was a moderate threat that merited some attention; though not nearly as much as actual threats such as China. Most of the events of the past two decades were the results of Russian paranoia playing out on a global scale, and pushing more and more nations in it's vicinity away.

Even this current exercise it a perfect example of what I'm talking about. Russia has now illustrated on a world stage that it is incapable of planning and executing modern military action with even a moderate degree of competence. It has managed to plan an stalled invasion while utterly misunderstanding the will of the people, and instead of realizing the nature of this mistake it has doubled down in an attempt to force through the issue while creating mortal enemies of what has historically been some of the most closely aligned people to it's interests. It has suffered extreme economic damage, while making only the smallest of gains. Even if successful, it will have to operate in an openly hateful country; a country full of people that will very likely want to retaliate with extreme damage to any and all targets of opportunity. This isn't some sort of psyops testing ground, and it hasn't been for 30+ years. It's just a failed state trying to claim the glories of a previous empire, and expecting their previous adversaries to take them as seriously as they were treated before. 

Russia is not the USSR. It does not have the industrial, academic, or military might of the USSR. It simply does not merit the response that the USSR did. The only threat it poses is the fact that it has nukes, which is the only reason the rest of the world doesn't spank it like a petulant child. After these last few weeks, Russia is doomed to languish and die a slow death, far more horrifying than having the risk of a potential NATO member on it's borders. The only hope the country has at this point is to go begging to China for a few scraps; something that China will be all to happy to take advantage of. This is of course assuming we don't see a nuclear escalation which will likely end up with most of the world becoming a smoldering ruin.

At this point Russia is a tragedy, a joke, and a failure, all packaged up in a country fronted by an aging and decrepit ""strong""-man clinging desperately to a memory, and imagining enemies out of nations that have barely had the time to spare for him until he decided to start a literal war on the tail end of a global crisis.

Urban combat is generally seen to be the easiest environment in which to engage armour and vehicles with handheld AT weapons, or even field expedients like sticky bombs and molotovs. If you're in a room by a window or balcony you are concealed until you pop up to fire, and you're hidden from view (albeit perhaps not protected high calibre or explosive return fire) as soon as you back deeper into the room. But if you retreat deeper into a building you have pretty hard cover, and usually multiple means of egress/exit. Compare that to a rural area where fields are completely open and moving in them means death, and even hedgerows don't offer hard cover of any kind. Even a well constructed trench is easier to pin and doesn't offer the same variety of firing opportunities/angles as a three storey building.

And urban environments have a lot of smoke, fire, civilians, vehicles, etc, which render things like thermal much less useful.

There is a pdf called ""directed energy missile defense in space"" by Aston something; it's a 1980s analysis by the government on what nuclear defense by lasers would look like. It's estimated you would need anywhere from 160 lasers satellites (10 meter lens diameter, 20 megawatt output) to fifteen satellites (with an insane 50 meter lens and 80 megawatt output). Ands that's before the opposing side adds any countermeasures.

There's also a guy on quroa called bill otto who headed these lasers programs (he has the credentials) and he answers questions about them all the time. For ballistic missile defense, he states they're all dead in the water, every last one including yal-1. Too expensive by far, and the us military doesn't want to work with those chemical lasers anymore. Instead, we've turned to kinetic interceptors.

The only two missiles I know capable of intercepting icbms are ground midcourse intercepter (gmi) and the rm-3. They almost certainly do not have enough to stop a full launch right now, but the goal is to have 500 rm3s by 2035 (contrary to popular belief, russia only has about 500 land based boosters). 

In terms of work happening in the background, I'm pretty sure the multiple kill vehicle keeps getting cancelled and then continued with new names. It might help shoot down ballistic missiles in a later stage of delivery, when the rentry bus is dropping warheads and decoys. And even though lasers should be dead, I know the military is interested in a space based laser again. We didn't have the capability to build pulsed lasers, but if we do now there is no way for the target missile to defend itself.

&gt; The one supreme objective for the future, which we discussed for each Nation individually, and for all the United Nations, can be summed up in one word: Security.
&gt; 
&gt; And that means not only physical security which provides safety from attacks by aggressors. It means also economic security, social security, moral security—in a family of Nations.
&gt; 
&gt; In the plain down-to-earth talks that I had with the Generalissimo [Chiang Kai-Shek] and Marshal Stalin and Prime Minister Churchill, it was abundantly clear that they are all most deeply interested in the resumption of peaceful progress by their own peoples—progress toward a better life. All our allies want freedom to develop their lands and resources, to build up industry, to increase education and individual opportunity, and to raise standards of living.
&gt; 
&gt; All our allies have learned by bitter experience that real development will not be possible if they are to be diverted from their purpose by repeated wars—or even threats of war.
&gt; 
&gt; China and Russia are truly united with Britain and America in recognition of this essential fact:
&gt; 
&gt; The best interests of each Nation, large and small, demand that all freedom-loving Nations shall join together in a just and durable system of peace. In the present world situation, evidenced by the actions of Germany, Italy, and Japan, unquestioned military control over disturbers of the peace is as necessary among Nations as it is among citizens in a community. And an equally basic essential to peace is a decent standard of living for all individual men and women and children in all Nations.

1. Russia did not aim for the slow grind, the war has turned into now. It is an effect of them flunking their first attempt at a swift vicotry.
2. You are assuming that Russia is actually trying to allow civilians to escape. The news coming from Ukraine these last two days suggests they don't. In fact they were shelling refugee columns earlier today. The narrative of how Russia is working to minimize civilian casualties, and they are 'Ukraine's fault', might convice a few Russian boomers, but not many others. And certainly not Ukrainians.
3. Even if it had been true, the narrative of ""We have let civlians flee, so everyone left is a combatant. Therefore our shelling is okay,"" is ridiculous on many different levels: For several reasons some non-combatants might still chose to stay. The city that is being turned to rubble is still the homes of people who have fled, and might want to return one day. Legally speaking, it is still a war-crime to shell civilian infrastructure, even if non-occupied.
4. Something about your post suggests that you think killing civilians is bad, but killing combatants is somehow okay. It might be an important distinction with regards to the GCIII but it isn't really all that important. Remember that Ukrainian soldiers are regular people trying to defend their home from a foreign power. They are the fathers, sons, friends, and husbands of the general population.

My main takeaway is just how non-linear an aircrafts fuel payload:range relationship is. I mean I guess it’s logical that takeoff and climb to altitude would use more fuel than cruising for the same distance once at altitude, I think I just seriously underestimated how much fuel that uses compared to regular flight. 

Also, taking off with 15,000lb of fuel and then adding another 5,000lb when down to 66% full, will get you significantly further than taking off with 20,000lb of fuel all things being equal. 

And just how much fuel is needed to be kept in reserve. As much as 10-20% of total capacity has been suggested - taking this out of the equation and considering only ‘mission’ fuel capacity, means that the mq-25 will delivery a much greater top up in % terms. 

I think the MQ-25 capabilities still seem a little bit basic, but it definitely makes more sense than it did in my mind before. I think it would be good to see a slightly bigger airframe, with the ability to store ~20,000lbs internally and the option to add another 6,000lbs in two external tanks. An integrated hose &amp; drogue system would be good too, so the tanks could be omitted if necessary to lower radar signature - although maybe that’s a moot point given the aircraft is probably not that LO anyway?

The point of these sanctions is to cripple the Russian economy as quickly as possible to degrade Russia's war-fighting capability. 

Every single part of the Russian economy is now globally integrated. All of their factories, including military ones, require inputs which are imported. 

In terms of Airlines, they have about three weeks left of air travel in Russia. The vast majority of Russian civilian aircraft are built by Boeing and Airbus. Airlines keep about three weeks of regularly replaced spare parts on hand. In about three weeks, internal Russian travel is fucked.

They have built around 20 regional propeller planes and 30 widebody jets, Ilyushin specifically, but that's replacing hundreds of aircraft with 50, 20 of which are short-haul. And even then, manufacturing spare parts for those requires foreign inputs.

They can't import anything right now. Shipping companies won't ship to Russia. Even if they could find some Chinese firm to pick up the slack, they can't pay anyone. Their dollar and euro assets are all frozen and they've lost access to most of their foreign currency reserves. They have a ton of gold, but no bank can buy it without facing fines or sanctions.

They have the ability to gain foreign currency by selling oil, but Gazprom is under sanction and cut off from swift, so it can't receive payments right now.

The Ruble is in freefall so no one will accept it.

And that probably includes Gazprom, considering they want foreign currency. 

They can't take cargo aircraft and fly goods in, even if it were feasible, because the lack of swift means they cannot afford to pay for fuel overseas. There's no payment mechanism for them to purchase fuel for aircraft internationally.

They import 40% of their seedstock, including 90% of their potato seeds, and while that's a temporary problem this season is going to suck, and in short and long term they will have significantly reduced yields without the GMO seeds they've been purchasing which pump up their productivity.

Russia is completely and utterly fucked economically. When things break down, they won't be able to repair them.

This includes their entire military supply chain which relies on Tires and other parts, including inputs for their factories making their own equipment, from overseas. 

Their current infantry radios were 90% made in china, and 10% finished in Russia. 

As for how quickly this degrades their military capacity? That depends on their stockpiles, and a lot of other factors. 

But ultimately, by wrecking the whole of their globalized economy, it will affect their ability to produce absolutely everything they make in the short term, wreck their logistics even further, and generally create economic chaos.

Almost every factory in Russia will run out of inputs and shut down. So we're talking mass unemployment here.

And without the ability to restart their logistics locally - that takes years - they are incredibly fucked.

So how long can they hold out? A few weeks to a few months. Longer than that and we're talking about a total economic collapse as bad or worse than the 1990s, because at least in the 90s, they could import food.",c75bff2f2c81a6222d3a07044aaa87bdea79b343,True,False,,,,,0,1646589485,,0,{},hzln987,False,t3_t7f7iz,False,True,t3_t7f7iz,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t7f7iz/just_how_effective_are_these_sanctions_against/hzln987/,1646589503,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646560685.0,

Besides, you reach diminishing marginal returns for shrinking chips, and the upfront cost of expensive chips can outweigh the wattage savings, particularly in single-use applications.

The industries that prioritize cutting-edge nodes tend to be those with performance per watt needs. Smartphones, tablets, server farms, high-end PCs including graphics chips (due to thermal constraints and people not wanting their gaming PC to be giant space heaters), crypto farms, etc.

[],False,,MurkyCress521,,,[],,,,text,t2_8prz42sh,False,False,"I say this with no disrespect, it is a reasonable question to ask. The answer is essentially the same as why does Russia use tactical nukes to take cities.

Starving a city requires time and deep encirclement. Depending on pre-existing food stocks and number of mouths. It can be several months. You need to maintain a complete encirclement for several months to a year. Prevent all air lifts of food. Deny all humanitarian corridors. Even still if you starve half a city to death, you still have to fight half the city.

Now nations have done this in our lifetime, but largely in conflicts where there is little media attention.

Starving a city the size of Kyev to death would be a terrible atrocity. Given the media attention and the length of time it would take, everyone responsible would be seen as outside the law and hounded for their lives (think Serbian war criminals). So the responsible parties are likely to face real personal costs even if they win they war. If they lose the war they will likely die in a Hague prison cell.

That such an atrocity was done in a war of aggression against a smaller nation would be a stain on Russia that would follow Russia for one hundred years. Russia's best bet would be to allow most of the civilian population of Kyev to flee, thus reducing the human cost and the cost to their image. However such an action means that the number of mouths to food ratio would drastically change in the defenders favor. It would take much longer to starve out a city.

Given the media attention Europe might even airlift food and supplies. Rather than a no fly zone, a NATO nation could parachute food in and say that any attack by Russia would be met in kind. Shooting down a humanitarian airdrop and then facing a NATO SEAD operation is not a good idea. Russia might still do it, they seem to like bad ideas but never-the-less such an action by NATO is more likely than NATO just imposing a no fly zone.

The sanctions against Russia would grow. The number of volunteers for Ukraines foreign legion would exceed the size of the Russian military.

China is trying to preserve globalism while the West starting to tear out autocracies at the cost of personal pain.

Authoritarianism (the real stuff, not vaccine mandates) has been on a slow march all across the world, even as democratic traditions started to waver in reliably democratic nations.  Democracies were making side deals with autocracies, putting their economic self interest over the collective defense of democratic nations.  People were starting to question the value of democracy after watching disasters democratic leaders.  

And then Russia reminded everyone why autocracy is bad, and why the democracies of the world need to stick together.  Russia has put on a nearly perfect display so far.  Putin demonstrated how in an autocracy one made man can kill tens of thousands and destroy vast amounts of prosperity for insane goals.  Putin also demonstrated how riddled with corruption these autocracies are, as his rotting army stumbles into the field to be cut down by barely Ukrainians.  

As counter points, Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people in general have served as truly heroic reminders that sometimes democracies need to stand and fight, and that we are strong enough and brave enough to do so.  They have galvanized unity among democracies and hardened resolves.

The real test is going to be when West continues to try and pushout the autocracies within their economic sphere.  That's where the real pain is.  I think the West is committed to that course with aggressive autocracies like Russia and China.

1) The first main difference is Democratization of the west.

The Concert of Europe was an alliance of authoritarian, absolutist monarchies, and imposed peace imposed from the top, down. Peace was not embraced from the bottom, up.

During the peaceful Age of Metternich, the most liberal nation in Europe was France, which as a result of the French Revolution had earned itself a constitutional monarchy, and a democratically elected legislature. But only the extremely wealthy had the right to vote.

 In France, a nation of 30-35 million people, only about half a million men were allowed to vote. As one might imagine, this kept the rest of the French people poor and angry.

The Age of Metternich was free of major conflicts, but it was filled with revolutions, particularly through 1848. This meant that war was always bubbling right under the surface.

That’s not the case in 2022. In 2022 we have representative democracy throughout most of the West. As a result, the average Westerner is wealthy, and feels like their voice is being heard. As a result people are generally happy, and there is a strong incentive to preserve the peace. So when Russia threatens war, people get angry.

[],False,,Frognosticator,,,[],,,,text,t2_7114p,False,False,"I see two major points of similarity between our current era, and the era of Metternich; and I also see two major points where our ages differ.

Let’s start with the similarities:

1) The first key point of similarity between these two eras of peace, is that the last  Great War is still a recent memory. There are still people alive in 2022 who fought in WWII. In historical terms, that’s extremely recent.

People on the street, but more importantly politicians in office, are terrified of another World War because it’s easy to imagine what the stakes would be. The destruction would be catastrophic, possibly civilization-ending. That fact is easy to understand when your grandparents, or maybe even your parents, faced that reality within living memory.

Will people be as scared of a global conflict in 50 years, when all the WWII veterans are dead and it was our great-grandparents who fought the last major war? Maybe… But for right now, the memory of WWII is fresh and clear.

2) Like in the Age of Metternich, in 2022 there is a clear system of international alliances to prevent war.

The United Nations; the IMF and the global banking network; and NATO all exist with the primary goal of preventing another major war. And so far they are all doing that job extremely well. 

Does this international system count as “globalism?” Well, maybe. There are some political differences between the UN, and the Concert of Europe, the biggest being the formality of international relations. But the bigger difference I see is technological. 

Modern global communications allow leaders and diplomats stay in touch at all moments, rather than having to write letters crossing continents and oceans. Television reporting, and videos available on Twitter and Instagram, make sure people at large know what’s going on in Ukraine.

So if by “Globalism” you mean the advancement of technology, then yes, some global technologies are helping to prevent war. WWI broke out in large part because of missed communication opportunities, which probably wouldn’t happen today.

But I can think of two bigger differences at play, between our current era and past eras, which are having a bigger role.",7a12aa3415f32bd19619b2c051b092f90cf5b8d4,True,False,,,,,0,1646582572,,0,{},hzl6c17,False,t3_t7we4m,False,True,t1_hzl1zer,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t7we4m/is_the_ukraine_war_the_first_test_of_globalism_as/hzl6c17/,1646582585,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646553772.0,

[],False,,Frognosticator,,,[],,,,text,t2_7114p,False,False,"I’m not sure if this is so much a defense question, as it is a social/economics question. But it’s certainly a question that’s relevant to the conversation.

I think the answer depends largely on how you define globalism. But I’d lean toward answering your question as “no;” only because there are other, more specific factors at play we can point to.

Let’s remember that we’ve had a global network of trade and alliances for several hundred years now. Globalism in that sense didn’t prevent the 7 Years War; and it didn’t prevent the Napoleonic Wars. 

A lot of people thought, prior to World War I, that western economies had become too interconnected to allow the conflict to go on for more than 6 months. They were very wrong. After that war we set up the League of Nations to prevent a second World War. Obviously that didn’t work out.

*But*, the international reaction to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has so far been swift and intense. Unless Putin does something truly stupid like launching missiles at a NATO country (still a possibility), it really does look like international cooperation will prevent the war in Ukraine from spiraling into a Great Powers Conflict. Russia’s ability to push this war beyond the borders of Ukraine has already been reduced to basically nil.

So what’s different about this conflict, compared to prior moments when international pressure failed to stop global wars?

I think the best place to look for historical analogues to this moment in history is the Congress of Vienna, and the Age of Metternich. After the Napoleonic Wars, the powers of Europe crafted a system of international incentives that built a peace which lasted for 99 years.

As of today, it has been 77 years since the end of World War II.

The Russians clearly don't care about war crimes.  They pulled out of the section of the Geneva Convention concerning war crimes against civilians a few years ago.  When they went into Chechnya, the first time.  There wasn't a building in Grozny with its walls and windows intact.  

https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/134EB/production/_123538097_gettyimages-541373224-1.jpg

The same is true in Syria, in cities like Aleppo.  Although they aren't solely to blame for that.

But it's just so much better to take a city intact or relatively intact.

If you've got artillery, HMGs and NVGs/drones it's not hard to stop a civilian population leaving a city.  It's also possible to damage a bridge on such a way as to make it impassable but easy to repair or to put a replacement span in between the columns.  

One of the reasons why the Polish Jews were so easy to get into the cattle wagons going to the death camps.  Was because they'd been herded into the ghettos in places like Warsaw and then starved.  They were weak and demoralised.  

African slaves going to the US were marched in chains for weeks from the interior of Africa to the ports.  Then ""conditioned"" at the ports, before being placed on over crowded ships.  Where they had little space or food and disease was rampant.  For a months long voyage across the ocean.  Knowing that they would never see Africa again.  As there was simply no way to get back, regardless of how far they walked.  So by the time they got to the US., they were mentally and physically broken.   

It's horrific and evil, a crime against humanity but the Russians are used to sending vast groups to Siberia and the Gulags or starving them, shooting them.   They've had an unbroken system of conscription since Peter I in the 1680s.  Possibly the only ""free and fair"" election that they've ever had was when Yeltsin won in 1991.  By the time of his second election, he had an approval rating in the single digits.  So he unleashed the oligarchs, to shore up his support.

So the Russians just really accept that they have no control and what can they do about anything?  Just follow orders like their father, grandfather.....",53db1d3b099079a8a3252ce78fc618ec5dbe525f,True,False,,,,,0,1646556905,,0,{},hzk2f4b,False,t3_t7c506,False,True,t1_hzjzeks,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/t7c506/the_two_debates_in_military_circles_the_war_in/hzk2f4b/,1646556917,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646528105.0,

They weigh the value of protecting our interests in Ukraine and the lives and freedom of the Ukrainian people against the risk of global nuclear annihilation and conclude that it is not worth it - which is a logical calculation, but *not* how the game is played.

For a rational actor who always chooses the best outcome, *any* outcome is more desirable than nuclear war. Sure, Ukraine isn’t worth defending over nuclear war, but what about Estonia? Article 5 is not some magical Word of God that compels us to act, the same calculus applies. What are the consequences if we don’t? NATO effectively ceases to exist as a deterrent, US loses all credibility to its allies and accepts complete geopolitical defeat in Europe - terrible, but *still more desirable compared to nuclear war*. And what about Poland? Germany? Are any of these countries worth defending if it’ll cause nuclear war? And we can ask ourselves the same question even if Putin starts landing troops off the shore of New Jersey: is it better to live under Russian rule or in a nuclear wasteland? Surely the former, right?

Of course, none of these are exactly realistic scenarios. But the point remains: playing like such a rational actor in the game of nuclear chicken has only one outcome - conceding everything.

That just begs the question though of how much can China backfill for Russia.

My gut reaction is that I'm not sure China is willing to help much. Chinese don't forget so easily how USSR treated them at times, and China also knows it's the only buyer big enough (and to some extent, with enough import capacity) to absorb most of the Russian oil/gas if it stops flowing to the EU. So China will demand and get huge discounts. And ""oh Putin you want semiconductors for your war? We don't want to risk sanctions against China, so we'll either not sell to you, or we'll sell under the table for a 1000% markup, take it or leave it, because we don't need you, but you need us. No we don't sell on credit, and we don't want rubles either. We'll barter for commodities like oil/gas/wheat/gold though.""

&gt; Walter J. Boyne, former director of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, is a retired Air Force colonel and author. He has written more than 400 articles about aviation topics and 29 books, the latest of which is Beyond the Horizons: The Lockheed Story. His most recent article for Air Force Magazine, “MiG Sweep,” appeared in the November 1998 issue.

Quote from the article:

&gt; Though not as famous as the 1948­-49 Berlin Airlift or as massive as the 1990-­91 Desert Storm airlift, this 1973 operation was a watershed event. Code-named “Nickel Grass,” it restored a balance of power and helped Israel survive a coordinated, life-threatening Soviet-backed assault from Egypt and Syria. It proved the Air Force concept of global mobility based on jet-powered transport aircraft. The airlift also transformed the image of the C-5 from that of expensive lemon to symbol of US might.

The US has a history of extraordinary airlifts into conflict zones.

You know- a lot of what you say is what I've been slowly been coming to believe. I was thinking at the start of the invasion that Russia would be able to topple the government in Kyiv rather quickly- with the resulting lack of command causing general disorganization in the Ukrainian defense and a much quicker Russian victory. But that didn't happen at all- rather the initial push towards Kyiv *appears* to have stalled out effectively putting an end to aspirations of a quick war. 

Besides the Crimea direction, virtually all the other fronts haven't secured any major cities and have mainly occupied areas that are close to the borders/pre-invasion frontlines of Russian aligned forces. This is a point that I'm getting kind of annoyed with the ""Ukraine is losing"" argument via the square footage lost (there are other better arguments I feel you can make than territory lost) as maps are imperfect and it's hard to determine what exact level of control Russians/Ukrainians have over a combat area. Also- if you're using this argument, you could say Germany was 'winning' World War 2 up until 1945.

Though part of the problem of discourse is that there is no real 'objective' measure of what one's winning is. Is winning for the Ukrainians just surviving as an independent state by the end of this regardless of territorial losses? Is it regaining all their territory? Russia is rather vague on their exact objectives besides 'getting rid of the 'junta' and 'denazifying' Ukraine'. Is it annexing Ukraine? Is it creating and maintaining a Puppet Government? A lot of these questions I feel have to be answered/clarified to determine whether or not a side is 'winning'. 

While I remain unconvinced that Ukraine will ultimately regain the Donbas and Crimea once this was is over- I am increasingly convinced based on the military performance of the Russian forces and the kind of resistance that Ukrainians are giving them that it will be impossible for Russia to occupy and hold the entire country. It is likely to me that they will eventually manage to take most of the lands east of the Dnieper- I'm becoming more doubtful that they'll be able to take the Western Parts- hell even taking all of Kyiv is becoming more and more doubtful to me. If they're having issues with taking Kharkiv, a smaller (but still big) city, one closer to the border, and one that is (in theory) more Russian supporting than Kyiv- how is a Siege of Kyiv going to go? Is Kyiv's capture still possible? Most certainly. But compared to what I was personally expecting- the Russian military has not been performing well.

As for SWIFT payment system

Take the Volkssturm. These were the absolute bottom-of-the-barrel recruits Germany was forced to mobilize towards the very end of World War 2. They were scantly armed and trained, and even they would receive two weeks of training. *And that wasn't nearly enough!* Here's how they did in combat:

&gt;The lack of weapons and equipment led to the deployment of only one battalion of the Zullichau-Schwiebus Volkssturm against the Russians. Barely armed, this battalion \[of Volkssturm\] saw action in the Meseritz fortified zone during late January 1945, but was 'steamrollered by Russian tanks' and suffered horrendous losses.

They performed so miserably and died in such great numbers that the Soviet and Allied forces actually pitied them. Giving a boy three days of training and a rifle is simply a death sentence. The fact that the Ukrainian leadership is willing to resort to this one week into the war while there's still hundreds of thousands of reservists yet to mobilize is simply stunning.

It puts me to mind of the resolution the Japanese wanted to get after they realized they were not going to win the war. They thought that they might be able to settle for some kind of conditional surrender and what they had in banked on is that the United States would push it towards unconditional surrender. We were fully prepared to invade the home Islands no matter the casualties. Of course, the majority of the planners had no idea the a-bombs were even part of the picture. 

So the question is who is going to bleed out first? If Ukraine is prepared to keep fighting indefinitely, if the need is supplies are helping and they don't look like they're going to run out of manpower anytime soon, then they have an incredibly strong negotiating position versus Putin. If Putin needs to pull out but Ukraine is still in a really bad position, then he actually has the leverage to make demands. 

It's unclear what he actually wanted. If we assume some of the leaked plans are correct, he may have wanted the whole enchilada. But even if he only wanted something modest like the breakaway regions and the land bridge to crimea, he would have to spin those achievements as a win. Might have been doable if it was the lightning war with minimal cost and casualties but that's a much harder claim to make after what we've seen.

You think the Soviet Army was winning when Leningrad began? First of all the Nazi army was already committing resources occupying to Western Front, it already wasn't a one v one.

Second of all 41 was the worst year for the Soviet Army, they losing troops by the hundreds of thousands in massive encirclements, such as the battle of Kiev, which was probably the most castrophic lost in the history of warfare(Almost 1 million troops lost in 1 month)

Third, are you implying since Nazi's didn't take Leningrad in 41 it was a good thing for the Soviets? Leningrad was supposed to be a siege, and the Soviets didn't relieve it until 44.

The people who ran the Soviet war effort certainly believed it. I guess you know more than Stalin.

Going back to Chechnya, the interwar period had many local warlords competing for power.

This allowed Putin to install a strongman like Khadyrov to control the region for him.

I don't see this as a possibility at a national level for Ukraine, and only a slight possibility if Russia forces Ukraine to split into federalized territories. At a national level, the Ukrainians rejected Kremlin friendly leaders in favor of ones that would bring them closer to the west. It's how we got to this point in the first place with the 2014 revolutions. A president installed by the Kremlin would not survive long.

Correct me if I'm wrong but it looks like their plan is to just draw the Russian Army in, stretch out their supply lines to the (apparently very low) breaking point and then defeat in detail?  


A lot of Ukraine doomers hype up how much square footage the Russian military has taken but judging by how badly especially that convoy north of Kiev is suffering attrition, it doesn't seem like seized territory is where the real game is.   


Also, the recurring theme of 'encirclement' keeps getting pushed but I've read that to effectively encircle or besiege an army entrenched inside a city, the besieging force needs to have something like a 5:1 personnel ratio, which the Russians definitely do not currently have, and so the defenders can still poke holes in the encircling forces at will to resupply as necessary.

[],False,,PhallusInUnderland,,,[],,,,text,t2_cre95rvz,False,False,"My question is this, and it has been alluded to and likely already brought up or phrased another way with the same logic, but I’ll add my armchair $0.02 anyway;

the TL;DR is, Putin is BEYOND a bad faith actor, a thug without a shred of propensity towards humanity, integrity, conscience, reciprocity, honesty- willing to undertake quite literally any and all means available to him so long as they lead to the ends he seeks to achieve and maintain his fragile ego and personal sense of power and security. He has brazenly shown is hand on the world stage so many times committing so many acts of brutality and abominable, debased wholesale slaughter, deception, open assassination through poisoning of opponents- a sign of ultimate cowardice and maximal sociopathy, 

and because like many have brought up re: war and esp nuclear weapons, the onus always falls on humans and human governments and institutions of decency, empathy, integrity, to uphold their word and to give a fuck about people- a weakness that unfortunately is always exploited to the fullest extent possible in a worst-man wins race to the bottom game of chicken to which any compassionate and decent person cannot fathom sinking to. 

Yet, Putin’s behavior is remarkably predictable and follows in patterns of conditioning that most mammals from dogs to children to grown ass men are susceptible to; He has effectively been rewarded for the most odious behavior imaginable, learned he can act with impunity, and now on the verge of possible senility and having gone this far, why are we pretending that our good faith laws and regulations and world order matter one single fuck in this situation? Diplomacy? That’s a joke to Putin; 

We are weak, we are vulnerable because we care for people who are dispensable to him. History has shown that autocrats and tyrants cut from the same cloth as Put-ler respond only to negative reinforcement in the form of a show of force, massive humiliation, often requiring an active removal of the dictator from a position where they pose a threat; This man is holding the world hostage,  royally fucking up the entire world order in every way imaginable, because he is a paranoid, jingoistic, irredentist, psychopathic, senile feeble lunatic cartoonishly holed up in his supervillain bunkers and mansions at the ends of 50 foot tables. 

He gives no shits about what our commitments are, those mean nothing to him and are merely opportunities for exploitation. He need only rattle the nuclear saber and its too risky to help Ukraine with air defense so we allow them to be bombed into oblivion. He now approves sending nukes to Belarus and giving them access to the Baltic; a LANDLOCKED country does not have a coastline, and Putin wasn’t promising to cede Russia’s territory to Lukashenko, he was telegraphing that The baltic states, close to St. petersburg and with large russian speaking populations are arguably next on his list of neo-Czarist conquests; 

They are much smaller in territory and I see no reason why he shouldn’t go after them when he can shake the nuke stick and have the transatlantic alliance “breadcrumbing,” saying well now article V isn’t worth it for trivial countries like lithuania and latvia and estonia to risk nuclear war, so we will just deescalate; We are like a battered housewife who can’t break up with Putin, calling the police but then telling them it was our fault our husband beat the shit out of us. Enough is enough, logic and reason don’t have the cachet we think they do with someone with a severe Axis-II personality disorder who has a neurodegenerative brain disease or florid psychosis, which can be diagnosed by a freshman psych student who’s watched a few hours of news in the last few weeks honestly does anyone deny that the man was already without conscience and now likely without any inhibition or restraint?

On and on it goes; There’s a piece of symbolic parchment paper with symbolic quill tipped signatures that is supposed to deter him? We couldn’t let Ukraine in to NATO bc it would risk russian aggression, but aren’t we prepared to defend an attack on any member? Corruption issues for Ukraine’s joining NATO aside, I don’t see a difference nor how this isn’t appeasement, Chamberlain and Sudetenland 2.0. 

Why , my thinking goes, would NATO risk the very same nuclear war that is so risky its out of the question to fire a shot at russia, for land that only differs in imaginary lines on a map, when we are willing to watch the wholesale massacre of innocents for fear of Putin’s saber rattling? This is a problem re: nuclear powers that is a band aid that will need to be ripped off at some point, and that point is sooner than later.

How is This NOT just kicking the goddam can down the road toward worse and more high stakes situations? 

eventually, if he isn’t taken out by someone from his circle on the inside, I fail to see how there is an ending any better than a Ukraine in tatters and a US and NATO in a full scale war anyway; 

We should have acted after Grozny, 
after Aleppo, 
after Crimea; 
Tyrants willing to stoop to the most heinously unconscionable of levels in committing barbarism are always going to exploit the rational,more responsible, compassionate, cooler heads who have responsibilities for safeguarding the worlds population and averting disaster, 

but this is just a slow motion march to a destination we have a better chance of reaching &amp; with less casualties if we beat him to the punch, act swiftly and decisively,

Regarding long term occupation, I get what you mean numbers wise, but I doubt it's in any way sustainable, especially when there is a decent amount of the populace from which they'd draw replacement troops, that is aware and against the invasion already.

The fact that the price of the war itself is higher than expected does not even go in to this equation. Just the economic sanctions, which are 100% expected, should be enough to convince a rational Putin to not attack.

You're spot on, this war is a clusterfuck for both Russia and Putin personally.  I don't know what to make of it... he must be terminally ill and wanting to take out a lifetime of grievance out on *someone* and go out with a bang.  The long term damage to Russia from this is absolutely staggering, and the chance of him being assassinated or overthrown is certainly 10-20%, the oligarchs are ruined and Putin is the reason why.  

The one thing I'm guessing the oligarchs care about is being able to live the high life with their girlfriends far far away from shitty Russia, and Putin ruined that with one fell swoop.  Where are they going to vacation now, Dubai?  This has to be one of the stupidest things a leader has done in this century.
