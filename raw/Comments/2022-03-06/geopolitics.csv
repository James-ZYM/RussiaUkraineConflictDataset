What has NATO and the West gain? Given NATO *does* have a history of armed intervention for both humanitarian (Kosovo) and non-humanitarian reasons (Afghanistan), announcing to the non-Western world that NATO is abandoning it's defensive stance might confirm the worst suspicions of China, Russia, and the rest of the world: that Afghanistan was not a fluke, the West sets the rules on what constitutes a humanitarian crisis, and existing norms of national sovereignty only apply if you're aligned with the West. 

What will NATO and the West lose? I think the overwhelming supportive Western response to Ukraine, followed by a NATO retooling, will polarize non-Western nations even further toward China and Russia. If there's a perception that a ""humanitarian NATO"" is hypocritical, casually racist and preferential historically towards Western nations, and another ploy to maintain US unipolar hegemony, a push to ""go global"" with NATO might drive non-Western nations toward China to escape a world dominated by the West. At worst, into a NATO-antagonistic pact. 

My question to you is: what would/should a humanitarian NATO do to gain the world's trust if it was truly to be a force for good? Is it even possible?",5723909c0e7fdbeb6dd5f841902becf64deb9855,True,False,,,,,0,1646607671,,0,{},hzmu92h,False,t3_t020va,False,True,t1_hzml3o5,/r/geopolitics/comments/t020va/russia_invasion_of_ukraine_live_thread/hzmu92h/,1646607689,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646578871.0,

I know Americans think that and I'm expected to parrot that line on reddit, but I'm not seeing that. Nor do I  believe Russia plans a long-term occupation. I think it's likely they will force a settlement, Ukraine will lose the Donbas region, and Russia will keep Crimea. 

I know how media outlets in the US and Europe are spinning this, but outside of that zone, no one is saying Ukraine is winning. I'm not sure about the Russian outlets cause I haven't watched any, but African, Middle Eastern, and Indian outlets have shown really balanced coverage of the crisis. None of them make the claim Ukraine is winning. In fact, I was watching one segment in which an Indian general exclaimed, ""If India drives their tanks into Islamabad, would the BBC say Pakistan is winning the war?"". It's a fair point. We have to look at the reality on the ground. If Ukraine was winning why would Zelensky be begging for a no-fly zone? It's obvious to me their air defenses are probably exhausted at this point. I don't think they will be able to force a stalemate either. Russia has made plenty of gains in the southeast of the country and will likely control all the port access soon. If the US wants to get in weapons it will have to do so by land and that openly provokes Russia to take action. Furthermore, as this grinds on, that population is going to understand they were duped by the US. I wouldn't be shocked if Zelensky's own people killed him as this continues.  

As for an occupation, I doubt it. I think Americans assume it will happen because we would do that, but it doesn't follow that the Russians would. Either way, if Russia pushes hard enough, the US might back off this thing entirely. This idea the whole world is behind us assumes there is no world beyond the US and EU. Most of the other nations haven't joined in these sanctions and refuse to do so. The middle east is neutral and MBS is openly refusing to stop the OPEC+ project. OPEC+ has said no to increased production every time they've been asked recently. I think we are seeing a realignment here in which the US doesn't have nearly the amount of power that it used to.

??

This was not some Kremlin-based comparison with ""NATO.""

Pleas don't try and stick to the topic which is: 

&gt;&gt;It seems that Putin's nuclear deterrence is working almost perfectly. 

So the question is - is it ""Putin's"" deterrence?  Or is it just a repeat of the same exact thing that was used to abuse Hungarians in the 1950s.

That's the question. Is it ""the same"" or did Putin do something different...

That is, someone was claiming that Putin is using  ""his"" new strategy.  But it isn't his. It is the threat of nuclear war that was the same strategy to destroy the will and freedom of Hungarian people in 1956.

Is it the same? Or different.

&gt;Ukraine is not strategically important

Again. It has nothing to do with strategy. It has to do with the sacrifice of human rights, made possible by the same exact threat that was used 60 years ago...  What matters is human rights.

But not to Putin. Nor was it to Russia in 1950s. 

What matters then? Changing the subject. Using propaganda techniques - so when someone from Ukraine calls a relative in Russia they get the Putin propaganda thrown right in their face.

It's not about strategy. It's about human freedom and human rights.

&gt;or major EU NATO members.

not strategically important for either the US or major EU NATO members.

Human rights are.  People are important.

Russia also tested the waters of what financial instruments would be used against anyone who tries to challenge Western order. Chinese will slowly and surely wean off those channels of influence the West has had, and likely recreate similar infrastructure under their own rules

Some sanctions might be seen as beneficial from Chinese point of view.

If Russia is forced to buy crappy Chinese processors, it might help get their chip industry off the ground

For the time being, Ukraine has a decisive advantage in terms of manpower. They have 270,000+ troops, plus potentially tens of thousands of Ukrainian men that have returned home to fight. 

Russia has 190,000 troops committed to this war. They can theoretically commit more, however the fact that Russia is calling on other nations to contribute troops makes me think that Russia is either unable or unwilling to increase their own troop commitment. A lack of equipment or training., internal political support and other commitments will limit the numbers Russia can deploy to Ukraine. Also, I think at this point it’s fair to question how much of Russia’s standing army only exists on paper. 

We were all quick to write off Ukraine due to Russia’s overwhelming technical advantage, but nearly two weeks in we’ve yet to see that advantage materialize.

Russia’s Air Force has been largely missing in action, and they’ve been unable to secure air superiority. It appears that some combination of fuel rationing, poor maintenance, poor training and a lack of munitions has kept the Russian Air Force grounded. Russia might have a great air force on paper, but that doesn’t mean anything if they can’t get planes in the sky that can fight effectively.

(Side note: things will get a lot worse for the Russia once Ukraine receives those fighter jets they’ve been asking for. The USA just approved a three-way deal to send the jets). 

Russia is also reportedly running low on their more advanced munitions (eg, guided missiles), and we now see them resorting to using some of their more primitive weapons. 

Further, Ukraine has the entire productive capacity of The West behind them. We are sending them javelins and it appears that they’ll still be receiving fighter jets from the west. Meanwhile Russia only has the productive capacity of whatever remains of their rump of an economy. Russia will struggle to produce some of the more advanced munitions they’ve been using.

Also, broadly speaking, this Russian military appears to be terribly trained and maintained. Their Air Force cannot coordinate operations with ground troops, which has rendered the air force irrelevant. Their “40 mile” convoy is stuck like sitting ducks, unable to do much of anything (and, no, the convoy being stuck is not part of a some brilliant secret strategy). I’m frankly in awe of how poorly coordinated their military is. 

Prior to this invasion, the prevailing narrative is that Russia would swiftly destroy Ukraine’s military, and that the tough part would be the occupation and insurgents. Now it’s looking like there won’t even be an insurgency — Ukraine’s conventional military will likely defeat Russia before it even gets to that point. Nothing is guaranteed, but Putin  has put Russia in an awful strategic position here.",dd858b12c7c542d98a02d8b20b8a1003771047ef,True,False,,,,,0,1646589808,,0,{},hzlo25l,False,t3_t0cgvt,False,False,t3_t0cgvt,/r/geopolitics/comments/t0cgvt/ukraine_megathread_all_new_posts_go_here_so_long/hzlo25l/,1646589822,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646561008.0,

The Western narrative is that Russia is doing what it's doing because there's a comic book villain at the helm. That's not what I'm assuming at all; I'm assuming that Russia is working against the clock to plug very real strategic gaps, and that it miscalculated with this war by becoming an enemy to its economic lifelines.

&gt; Let's assume that your view is correct and these are all inventions: it means that Putin was willing to invade a country and put the entire economy of Russia, its conventional military capacity, and its entire standing in the international scene on the line, based on some sketchy neo-imperial ambition that will fail.

I don't think this is driven by irredentism or a sense of prestige. If Canada was a Chinese client instead of a US client, the US would either pour tons of resources into defending the northern border or invade Canada.
'
&gt; Again, I'll assume that your view is correct. It basically means that Putin's decision was not calculating but completely irrational (of course, this might be true after all). But then, what makes you think an irrational Putin would accept a peace plan like the one you're proposing?

""Irrational"" and ""incorrect"" aren't quite the same thing. I think that the Kremlin made a calculation and is bad at math.

&gt; The alternative is that Putin isn't a madman which would mean that he had reasons to intervene in Ukraine and he acted calculatingly. It would in turn mean that yours wouldn't be a sweetheart deal to Russia, considering all the concesions Putin would have to make. In that case, what makes you think that a rational Putin would accept a peace plan like the one you're proposing?

I don't know if Putin the man would accept it (I lean towards no), but I think it's a pretty good deal for Russia the country in that it addresses several of their strategic vulnerabilities all at once, at little cost to them.

&gt; There would have to be some guarantee that Ukraine won't punish Crimea and the Dombas after peace is achieved.

This is true, and would have to be addressed in the details of the treaty.

It is the exact same as was done during what we period we referred to as the ""Hungarian Revolution.""  That is:  Putin didn't invent it. He's playing the same crooked hand that Khrushchev played. 

It shows two things.

1) That the Russians are still just as brutal as they were then.

2) Putin is hiding behind the same mushroom cloud today as 60 years ago.

Nothing has changed.

Nov, 1956:

After all NATO has a clear history of manufacturing coup d'etat all over the place wherever they see it fit. Why would Russia be an exception? We have to realize that Russia and NATO are rivals, and the only thing keeping each other from tearing theirs throat apart is the fact that Russia has nukes, any other country would have already fallen by now. This is no moral matter, just that the Kremlin knows that their current status quo isn't compatible with western ideas. To me is pretty clear that an Ukrainian ascension to NATO would at the very least prompt a civil war within Russia, probably subverting and arming Russian Muslims on the south, we know they have the know how.  Of course Ukraine wasn't gonna enter NATO anytime soon, but we have already seen how strong their military really is, which leave me wonder, how much stronger the Ukrainian army would have got in the next, let's say 5 or 10 years from now? Putin seems to have realized that there wasn't any more time to wait, and no matter the cost this was their last and only chance to neutralize an existential threat in the near future. Just to clarify, Ukraine has been arming itself like mad the past few years (for obvious reasons, but nonetheless arming itself) with military factory and Ankara was providing them with drone technology which proved to be extremely effective on the battlefield, also they have been moving forward with their own missile program.

Let's that your view is correct and these are all inventions, it means that Putin was willing to invade a country and put the entire economy of Russia, its conventional military capacity, and its entire standing in the international scene on the line, based on some sketchy neo-imperial ambition that will fail. And I assume that it will fail because after your deal Russia (and Putin) will be worse off than in the antebellum: Russia having to pay for reconstruction efforts, giving back Crimea, assuming that what Putin did was a war crime and having to accept a pardon (which I suppose would have to given to the all the top brass too and to everyone involved).

Again, I'll assume that your view is correct. It basically means that Putin's decision was not calculating but completely irrational (of course, this might be true after all). But then, what makes you think an irrational Putin would accept a peace plan like the one you're proposing?

The alternative is that Putin isn't a madman which would mean that he had reasons to intervene in Ukraine and he acted calculatingly. It would in turn mean that yours wouldn't be a sweetheart deal to Russia, considering all the concesions Putin would have to make. In that case, what makes you think that a rational Putin would accept a peace plan like the one you're proposing?

In any case, even If was there was even a sliver of truth to any of Putin's excuses to go to war, those issues he brought up would have to be addressed in any hypothetical peace plan. We do know, for instance, that after 2014 Ukraine cut off water suplies to Crimea.

On the other had, he has also sometimes said off-hand comments that shows some latent anti-semitism.  Overall, it seems likely that he is not personally super anti-semitic, even if he does have some ingrained beliefs / prejudices.

However, Putin has gathered a European Fascist ruling coalition.  A large number of the people he surrounds himself with, that he is comfortable socializing with and comfortable having input in making decisions / implementing policy are outright anti-semitic.  A tentpole of European Facism is that Jews use liberal norms, pushing democracy, secularism, feminism gay rights, civil rights and the like to introduce impurity an weakness to a country.  Then the weekend and impure / immoral country can then be brought under the domination of the global elite, and the global elite are then under the domination of Jews.  European Facism is also intertwined with Christian Nationalism.

Under the combined narrative of European Facism and Christinan Nationalism, during WW II, the real / biggest victim of the Nazis were the Russian Orthodox Christians, as the USSR lost about 27 million people, something like 4x as many Jews who were killed in the Holocaust.  In their narrative, Jews ultimately were responsible for the rise of the Nazi party, are responsible for WW II and responsible for the Holocaust.  The narrative then believes that Jews are using the Holocaust to seize the narrative of WW II to their advantage, both in misdirecting attention from who they believe are the true innocent victims (themselves), and to guilt and co-opt the West, who themselves dominated by modern Nazis, which are trying to wipe out pure Europeans and European Christianity.

Putin is boxed into a corner.  Once he gave the order to invade, he had to be all on.  Do or do not, there is no try and all that Yoda stuff.

Sanctions will not lift and he gets to say that it wasn’t about him, again with the propaganda about some worldwide Nazi cabal oppressing Russia is to blame for everything.

Putin, on the other hand, is very, very active in maintaining good relations with members of the Soviet Union with things like the CSTO and the ECU -- things which Russia doesn't _really_ benefit from directly except in maintaining influence in those regions.

How long do you think these sanctions will last. Keeping in mind this is already effecting the global ecconomy and you already have the Right in the US complaining about oil prices.

If the Midterms go through Republican way, Biden can choose to either act based on what the voters are saying or on the moral action.

If he listens to the voters the EU is basically going to go, ""WHAT THE F$%K... WHY ARE YOU ENDING RUSSIAN SANCTIONS!""

This situation either leads to a more divided NATO (unlikely but good for Putin) or the EU likewise lifting its Sanctions.

If the Dems win...nothing changes.

Rinse and repeat for every election until the Sanctions are lifted.

Putin ONLY looses in 3 scenarios.
1) The sanctions force him to abandon his plans OR lead to him being overthrown.

2)The global economy of wealthy nations finally recovers from the GFC stagnation and rapid improvement in ecconomic growth occurs.

3)Circumstances in the global ecconomy conspire in such a way that post recession recovery no longer takes 24 months to reach pre-reccession levels.

 Note also this issue with water access to Crimea, from a canal built 50 miles into Ukraine. 2020: [Inside Crimea’s slow-burn water crisis](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/inside-crimeas-slow-burn-water-crisis/).  

&gt;Before Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, 85% of its water was supplied via a canal that runs from the Ukrainian region of Kherson, directly to the north.  In 2014, Ukraine blocked the canal by building a dam, stopping water supplies to the peninsula.

Of course it is logical that Ukraine cut off Crimea's water after losing Crimea.   But this is one reason Russian has invaded west from Ukraine.  Russia wants to ensure Crimea has water from this Ukrainian region permanently.  This, incidentally, is one of the first examples of what many people have been warning about in conjunction with global warming: *Conflict over Water Access*",9a38b8b6ff1d5ad9687a7abfc153c75b41452780,True,False,,,,,0,1646557122,,0,{},hzk2oqs,False,t3_t7ol6n,False,True,t1_hzk133g,/r/geopolitics/comments/t7ol6n/russia_poised_to_deploy_up_to_1000_more/hzk2oqs/,1646557132,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646528322.0,

That is nearly a Corps worth of combat power destroyed. I don't have the greatest order of battle to go off but another regiment worth of combined artillery and ADA also gone. That doesn't include personnel. I'm at a loss for words. I know there is a lot of misinformation out there and I'm sure these numbers are partially inflated to a degree. Some things just don't make sense. None of this makes sense. Russians with mass casualty green on green event just outside of Kiev. Directing an absurd amount of military strength on a small town with zero strategic value. Planning a ground mobility from the south where there are extreme limits on transportation corridors. Deliberately striking civilian targets when an overwhelming majority of civilians oppose your presence let alone are organizing to kinetically engage you. Causing a traffic jam of military vehicles that stretches 40+ km. Running out of fuel. Running out of food. Running out of morale.

Here is what I think is really going on. Russia has no C2. They have no military intelligence capability. Ground commanders are not talking to their flank. They stretched about 5 division worth of ground combat power in a regimental structure. Basically their battalion tactical groups are roaming free with a c2 that has no idea what they are doing. Most troops have never been in battle, are not trained to fight and do not want to fight. A good number are abandoning their post. I lost count of the equipment captured by Ukraine. Tanks, ADA, artillery, APC, BMPs are all being abandoned and captured. This is blowing my mind.

Russia's ground targeting capability is also non existent. I have not been paying attention since the weekend but last week, Russia couldn't take out a stationary TV tower. They couldn't do it. Even with cruise missiles, they can't get it done. Artillery, MLRS, and other rocket propelled systems are not hitting targets. They are missing whatever it is they are aiming at. Yes, they have hit targets. Not saying they are that incompetent. But, when they leveled Kharkiv last week with overnight bombardments, it did nothing. They destroyed a lot of brick and mortar buildings, some equipment and civilians. Nothing of value. Well, at least nothing of strategic value that we know of.

Airpower.. Every day I'm seeing something crazy. Ukraine did a little offense when nobody was looking and took out ground defense radars. The tactics and techniques being used by the Ukrainian pilots is working. I'm not convinced Russia has pilots for their Air Force. The pilots they do have or had have been killed. I have not seen or read any reports about a Russian Ace. I'm looking for Russian propaganda from their air attack. Nothing. Af for their rotary wing air craft, this one doesn't need explanation. Russian Pilots are scared. This is a fact. Flying into Ukraine right now is almost guaranteed death.

SOF is probably their biggest weakness. Let's be real. You're not supposed to be captured let alone in the day time. They jumped a bunch of guys into a hostile urban environment with no subsequent ground support. What a mess. Doesn't matter how much training you have, you either wait it out in hiding while you starve or you try and blend in with your surroundings. Ukraines counter intelligence units have be working overtime. Citizen watch also making this real easy for the Ukrainian Army. Not sure what's going on elsewhere on the battlefield. I am sure there are other areas they are succeeding that doesn't make the web. That is all I have to go off for the time being.

Now to the point at hand, the mercenaries. I don't know where to begin. They sent in the Chechens. They lose their top general on the first or second day. They have been met with heavy resistance. People forget, the Chechens who fought in the 1990's also fought in the 2000's. These are not he same Chechens. This is a new generation of fighters who are not the battle hardened decapitators that we all know. I'm not sure an element of this size has ever been deployed out of the Caucasus. This is just an extension of the disorganized chaos we've been seeing. The other groups like the Wagner group. Not sure what added benefit they have for the Russians other than combat experience. They are not a force multiplier by any means. Most of them are old washed up former Russian Army SOF. There comes a time in your late 40's/early 50's that impacts your performance on the battlefield. I'm sure they have the capacity to do damage. I haven't seen it yet. It's also possible that the success the Russian army is having comes from these groups. Haven't seen that either. Albeit there was just an attack on a nuclear plant right before it was captured. That could have been this group. Lots of information gaps.

TLDR: Russian army is disorganized and taking unfathomable losses after a week of fighting. Strategy uncertain and unknown how sustainable current campaign is and the state of Russian forces not good. Overall failure by the Russian.

So bad that attempted reforms at removing cigarettes from rations had to be rolled back because the soldiers were so against it. A lot of their tobacco comes from China and India, which abstained from the vote, but they get a ton from Brazil and other countries who voted against them. 

With the currency issues and sanctions, I have to imagine tobacco will be severely limited and expensive when available. Won’t it be hard for soldiers to get a lot of cigarettes? Isn’t the majority of time spent in a military operation sitting around and waiting? Don’t people heavily addicted to cigarettes start behaving somewhat erratically after only a few minutes when they don’t know if they’ll ever find another cigarette, when they’re in enemy territory and every store has been looted already and every supply truck that makes it to the front is bringing fuel or ammo, or maybe food or water.

Between tobacco supply, currency exchange rate, sanctions, and frontline logistics on display, their soldiers will be running out of cigarettes sooner or later.

[],False,,Harmonic_Strategy,,,[],,,,text,t2_6cpdderd,False,False,"I responded to the OP so I feel obligated in good faith to pick apart this one too. I'm assuming Russia doesn't actually want the conflict to reignite as their demographics look worse and worse in the future years.

&gt;1. Ukraine surrenders unconditionally

It's not unconditional if the peace treaty has other conditions. Unless you just mean Ukraine puts out a statement of surrender in addition to the other demands? Perhaps I am overanalyzing a not-serious effort.

&gt;2. Sanctions removed immediately

Sure, no big deal, this is the easy part assuming agreement can be met elsewhere. Might have to go in phases if other parts require cooperation from Russia over longer timeframes. 

&gt;3. Ukraine becomes federation, with veto powers for the separatist regions 

&gt;4. No NATO or EU for Ukraine; 

These two demands will probably not be acceptable alone, and definitely not together. If there was a federal system, veto power to EU on top of everything else would be a red line for future development. One or the other may have been attainable before the war with further diplomacy, we'll never know now.

Maybe an expiring time limitation, like no EU until 10 years later and no NATO ever, or no EU/NATO for 20 years unless the eastern regions agree. But the main obstacle is trust, obviously. Russia *just* invaded Ukraine, no security guarantee and no alliance future means Ukraine is effectively vassalized. It's possible Ukraine might keep fighting until total ruin rather than accept the effective destruction of their sovereignty.

&gt;Russia retains skeleton force in Kiev and few more major cities
This seems silly except as part of a total capitulation, for the security reason above. Why not ask for a large garrison in every town small and large and demolition charges in the nuclear plants besides? 

In all honesty though, this seems like it would be toxic to Russia too as it just invites resistance/ insurgency. Garrison troops would be easy targets and the inevitable reprisals would just reignite the conflict. Knowing the result was *inevitable* relitigation of this war from a weakened position, it could easily be rational for Ukraine to keep fighting an indefinitely insurgency.

&gt;5. Crimea officially handed over to Russia

This is probably the easiest for Ukraine to agree as its ante bellum status quo (de jure changing to match de facto reality). It wouldn't be sufficient for Russia though, they need water from the mainland or Crimea is crippled forever. That means a long term water sharing agreement and/or land grants associated with the canal and river system.

&gt;6. Russia helps rebuild Ukraine, no western involvement

This is another silly one. The Ukraine crisis and humanitarian suffering are big deals in the west. Cutting the west out of Ukraine rebuilding means letting a lot of people starve and die needlessly. It would be massively and maybe irrationally toxic politically for any democratic leader to accept terms like this.

Russia is extremely poor and will struggle just to heal its own economy from sanctions (stock market chaos, inflation, contracts and projects that stay canceled, being delisted from private investment). If they have to support Ukraine singlehandedly, they will probably fail and create even more opposition to their rule. If anything, *Russia* should be the ones demanding the *west* help contribute to rebuilding efforts.",9f0dfc1c14312f7cbcf0cb8160b7219e1d8a78e3,True,False,,,,,0,1646549369,,0,{},hzjsjo9,False,t3_t0cgvt,False,True,t1_hziwbit,/r/geopolitics/comments/t0cgvt/ukraine_megathread_all_new_posts_go_here_so_long/hzjsjo9/,1646549383,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646520569.0,

Because Crimea  with its large naval base is hugely valuable to Russia.  Allows Russia to project a military presence into the Mediterranean.  A nation such an asset this will look centuries and more years into the future.  Imagine the U.S. without Hawaii and the Pearl Harbor naval base.  What would the U.S. do to protect that asset?

Russia's actions makes sense geopolitically, but Russian leadership are such thugs, including the [Magnitsky murder](https://www.justiceinitiative.org/litigation/magnitsky-v-russia), that the seizing of Crimea can't be countenanced.

[],False,,Harmonic_Strategy,,,[],,,,text,t2_6cpdderd,False,False,"&gt;1. Russia withdraws from Ukraine and Georgia immediately, including Crimea

Withdrawing from Crimea is probably going to take a general perception of impending calamity. The people there probably want to be Russian more than any other area mentioned, and it's historic and strategic value is immense. Georgia I think is less strategic but symbolic all the same. 

That said perhaps access to eastern Ukrainian ports could be improved in exchange for water to Crimea. Donetsk and Luhensk do need to be accounted for too, and their borders established if they get increased autonomy.

&gt;2. All sanctions on Russia are removed immediately

Sure, no big deal, logical starting point is to remove sanctions pressure (maybe in phases, etc).

&gt;3. Putin steps down. No attempt is made on his person (i.e. trying for war crimes), and there will be no outside interference in selecting his successor.

Idk at this point he would probably need his own island, like Elba for Napoleon. Getting him to agree to step down would likely be a blocker for the whole peace project. Would probably need China and India involved in the peace process to get anything like this.

&gt;4. Russia pays an indemnity for the rebuilding of Ukraine, something worth the trouble of asking for, but not crippling to the recovering Russia.

Asking for cash is sort of insulting at this point given how effectively the west is using financial weapons. The West is already supplying Ukraine w military gear and would be the logical partners to rebuild it. If anything Russia would compete to have a slice of the rebuilding game. That said this could be an easy salve for both Ukraine Russia in lieu of asking territorial concessions like the return of Crimea.

&gt;5. Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Georgia all join NATO immediately.

I understand the impulse. But it seems a big stretch to get nations with such divergent history on track to military alliance. Especially ones that have been fighting a war yesterday to ally up tomorrow.

To wrap up, it feels like status quo ante bellum (maybe with small adjustments) is the natural balance point. Asking for big concessions from Russia requires Putin to yield a centimeter, which may be unattainable. A face saving compromise that defuses this war and the next (without compromising Ukraine) should be good enough.",ee01576a8c8a2761e8fdeda495f58a1890d80b90,True,False,,,,,0,1646546733,,0,{},hzjojru,False,t3_t0cgvt,False,True,t1_hzijdn2,/r/geopolitics/comments/t0cgvt/ukraine_megathread_all_new_posts_go_here_so_long/hzjojru/,1646546744,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646517933.0,

It seems that Putin's nuclear deterrence is working almost perfectly. The west is reluctant to get militarily involved in any way and the US ruled out troops on the ground seemingly before the invasion even began. US and NATO intelligence surely know they would prevail in a purely conventional conflict, and that’s only become more obvious based on what we’ve seen this past week. It almost feels like Putin is holding the west hostage with his threats of nuclear war, despite NATO having equal or better nuclear capabilities. 

If we look beyond Ukraine and focus on a potential ""special military operation"" in the Baltics by Putin, then the nuclear game theory becomes more complex. Assuming rational actor status for Putin, an invasion of the Baltics would never occur in the first place. This is because, since we already established Putin is aware a NATO conventional conflict is impossible to win, invasion would essentially be equivalent to a nuclear first strike. That is unless Putin is prepared to test the integrity of NATO article 5. If article 5 breaks down for whatever reason (e.x. western leaders aren’t prepared to end the world over Latvia), then a Baltic invasion would just turn into what the Ukraine conflict is now. Another factor to consider is the Putin madman theory that basically throws out any rational actor assumptions. If that’s the case, then Putin doesn’t consider the end of the world when invading the Baltics.

You could just stop here. Also works for almost any period of Russian history.

&gt;... does it seem like likely that Rus will be cut off from the Western world for perhaps decades? ... I fail to see a way where things resume to where they were even two weeks ago.

The first question is unknowable and probably depends on both the war and the peace. If Russia commits some flashy, horrible atrocity, then even a definitive peace might not end the sanctions for decades. A peace treaty perceived as injust could also fuel tension and issues that keep this alive. It's not like the west doesn't have decades of experience on containing a hostile, expansionist Russia. On the other hand, a war that avoids [obvious catastrophe ](https://www.livescience.com/ukrainian-nuclear-plant-set-on-fire) and somehow secures a peace treaty the west can live with might see a relatively fast reversal. There's also the unlikely(?) scenario where Russia starts to collapse, eg Putin is assassinated and the country starts to slide into madness. In that case sanctions might be very quickly waived to allow humanitarian relief.

The psychopolitical shocks are likely irreversible though. [The German Chancellor speech on Feb 27 ](https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en/news/policy-statement-by-olaf-scholz-chancellor-of-the-federal-republic-of-germany-and-member-of-the-german-bundestag-27-february-2022-in-berlin-2008378) is a potent example. Germany has begun the political process of gearing up for rearmament, and with something like 75% of Germans approving. I don't see any way to undo that. There's also the slow-motion dismantling of the pro-Putin niche of the American right, [see Pence's speech attacking Putin apologists.](https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/04/politics/mike-pence-republican-putin-rnc/index.html) 

&gt;the West should make it very clear on how sanctions can be reduced or reversed because they have the appearance of being permanent which is pretty counterproductive. 

That hasn't happened yet because of the speed with which the hard-core sanctions (swift, currency reserves) needed to be put in place. Like the bigger challenge at first was to do the sanctions at all, not emphasize how reversible they are. Important to remember these things may be an explicit part of negotiations happening behind closed doors too.

Some of them are relatively simple to undo logistically. Many joint ventures have been paused but not yet physically liquidated for example. The longer time goes on the more locked-in the consequences are. Foreign partners will find new places to build factories, key labor will find new jobs, energy consumers will find or build new energy sources. Also western firms might just nationalize Russian projects outright and vice versa. Then there's secondary shocks like credit availability, hyperinflation and capital controls making Russia [uninvestable](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-02/msci-pulls-russian-equities-out-of-its-key-emerging-market-index) even if it's not formally sanctioned. 

&gt;But now, people across Russia and especially those in major cities are going from a relatively European lifestyle (and in Moscow and St P, a very cosmopolitan and enjoyable lifestyle) to what may be early Soviet living standards.

Yep. Living standards are going to plummet. Russia is a net exporter of both food and fuel, but consumer goods, computers, etc are going to be in very short supply. Who knows what effect not having the latest iPhone will have on Russians. Scarcity will fuel unrest, but military / police could also benefit by comparatively higher access to rationed goods (ussr system).

The real cost will likely be to industry though. Russia is a major arms exporter, and those weapons and the factories to make them require a lot of advanced components. Those advanced components meanwhile have complex international supply chains. This could create a self-fulfilling collapse loop: Russia loses some imported components, which lowers its production capacity and ability to maintain its machinery. This results in lower output, leading to less profit, leading leading to less components, on and on (this basically happened to Venezuela's oil industry already).",6b21553fe7bef2e72866057a3c60e0b5172a0bc5,True,False,,,,,0,1646539690,,0,{},hzjcdg7,False,t3_t020va,False,True,t1_hzije7f,/r/geopolitics/comments/t020va/russia_invasion_of_ukraine_live_thread/hzjcdg7/,1646539706,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646510890.0,

Also Uranium is the best resource investment of the next 30 years. Russia and France are building a minimum of 22 new plants and it's becoming increasingly considered in Canada. There's a case for the Ukraine conflict being a larger symptom of a lot of the things discussed in the video. Gas exploration investments are way down and Russia wants to control Donbas and Crimea, where 80% of the deposits and reserves are.

[],False,,WilliamWyattD,,,[],,,,text,t2_awhnx2o,False,False,"Have no doubts, the Liberal International Order (LIO) has always been coming for the CCP. They know it. You should too. It's an inevitable, unstoppable, unavoidable confrontation. But the timescale is unpredictable. The LIO is indeed a norms-based order, and the CCP by its very existence, and by its reign over such a large and influential country, violates those norms. The LIO had hoped that by engaging economically with China, the CCP would slowly self-liquidate. This hasn't happened, and now most people are convinced it won't happen. So Plan B has been afoot for awhile.

But China is a major nuclear power that has become deeply entwined with the global economy. In order to minimize harm to its own members, the LIO is moving against the CCP slowly at first. Supply chains first need to be re-ordered and made more robust (for reasons that include but go beyond opposing the CCP). Economies also need to be prepared for greater decoupling. But once that has been done, events will accelerate. Still, this will likely be slow economic and military containment that may or may not rise to Cold War levels. China has many internal challenges. As there is a good chance that many of these will help do the CCP in on their own, external pressures may not need to be as high as those arrayed against the Soviet Union. 

Of course, the CCP could further accelerate events on their own by attacking Taiwan or taking some other overtly aggressive action. Whether they will do so is hard to say. I do not believe that at the end of the day, an attack on Taiwan, successful of not, will fundamentally alter the trajectory of events--just the pace. I believe that events with Russia are demonstrating what most people should always have known: Multipolarity is overstated. It is coming, one day. But that day is further off than many had come to believe. The West still rules the world when it puts its collective foot down, and its ability to act collectively is less impaired than many had thought.

For all its faults, the LIO is the only order game in town. And when nations stare into the abyss of a modern, nuclear-armed world without an order, they get scared very quickly. It's easy to be petulant and envious and ideological until one has to really consider what a nuclear world playing by classic geopolitical rules truly looks like. That said, in the medium and long terms, the LIO still faces serious challenges, even after China and Russia have been put in their places. 

Chief among these challenges are how to more fairly share the burdens of providing public goods and enforcing the Order's red lines, how to have effective decision making when power is more diffuse within the order, and how to better bind the US to the Order's collective rules and decisions. It won't be easy. But the Order's key challenges have to do with growing multipolarity within the Order, not without. The Order will also have to fundamentally re-evaluate future red lines with respect to governance and human rights, as well as what areas of the world are most strategically important. The Order can set high ideals, but to be sustainable and more universal, the thresholds for nations actually being out of bounds and requiring intervention have to be reset to more tolerant levels. The Order has hopefully learned that it cannot intervene actively, particularly with force, injudiciously.

So assuming the only way sanctions are ever removed or lessened is a withdrawal from Ukraine, does it seem like likely that Rus will be cut off from the Western world for perhaps decades? I could see some businesses or countries slowly easing them up in the shorter term once the media calms down, but I fail to see way where things resume to where they were even two weeks ago.

Personally, I think the West should make it very clear on *how* sanctions can be reduced or reversed because they have the appearance of being permanent which is pretty counterproductive. 

On another thought, I personally can't imagine these sanctions and restrictions being in place for years. Not that I don't think it's possible, but I can't wrap my head around it. Those in the Soviet Union, or in North Korea today, never exactly *lost* luxury. They were born in very difficult conditions, and at least in the case of SU, their lives did improve decade to decade. After WWII, what we imagine as an extremely difficult life was certainly a step up from the warzone hell they were in beforehand, and each decade did get relatively better even if it never compared to lives in the West.

But now, people across Russia and especially those in major cities are going from a relatively European lifestyle (and in Moscow and St P, a *very* cosmopolitan and enjoyable lifestyle) to what may be early Soviet living standards.

I can't wrap my head around this being sustainable.
