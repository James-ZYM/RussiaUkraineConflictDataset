&gt;Dedication to fear mongering is not a determination of the international policy of other nations. It's sad to see Russia never got past the cold War. The rest of the world completely moved on, but here sits Russia, still licking it's wounds from WW2. Have you ever heard of a self-fulfilling prophecy? Because we're seeing one in real time right now.

The cold war never ended. No one who has opened a history book believes it was over, the way Russia was treated after the collapse of the USSR just further proves this and your cold war with China, you have always been at war with EurAsia and will be at war with them until one side is eradicated. 

&gt;Your answer is bullshit, and Russia STILL has opportunity to stop what they fear by stopping this invasion and becoming a true world partner. Or they can continue down a path that will eventually lead other nations to decide the Russian Federation can no longer exist. If you want Russia to be what Germany was after WW2 ended, this is how you get it.

So what you want is a military qurantine of Russia (NATO), where every inch of Russias borders has a US FOB on it, with US radars spying on every move they make? And once Russia is defanged and contained you can get to work on dismantling them from the inside huh? With your CIA operations and propaganda and cultural imperialism.

Also, it seems that you don't know who Bandera was either. You describe him as Nazi, but it seems that he was not:

&gt;...Bandera's expectation that the Nazi regime would post factum recognize an independent fascist Ukraine as an Axis ally proved to be wrong. In 1941 relations between Nazi Germany and the OUN-B had soured to the point where a Nazi document dated 25 November 1941 stated that ""... the Bandera Movement is preparing a revolt in the Reichskommissariat which has as its ultimate aim the establishment of an independent Ukraine. All functionaries of the Bandera Movement must be arrested at once and, after thorough interrogation, are to be liquidated..."". On 5 July, Bandera was transferred to Berlin. On 15 September 1941 Bandera and leading OUN members were arrested by the Gestapo.  
In January 1942, Bandera was transferred to Sachsenhausen concentration camp's special barrack for high-profile political prisoners Zellenbau. In April 1944, Bandera and his deputy Yaroslav Stetsko were approached by a Reich Security Main Office official to discuss plans for diversions and sabotage against the Soviet Army. In September 1944, Bandera was released by the German authorities and allowed to return to Ukraine in the hope that his partisans would harass the Soviet troops, which by that time had handed the Germans major defeats. However, in renewed pursuit of his dream of an independent Ukraine, he had his partisans fight against both Soviets and Germans.

So, it seems that he used Nazis to pursuit his own agenda. And he used them much more efficiently than Stalin did, when Stalin signed the Peace treaty with Nazis.

There is surely more I would like to say about the above, but I give a quick answer for now on your questions. 

1. I will watch the video you linked regarding the Nazism in Ukraine. I will identify the part of the protest and I will let you know what I gather from it. I gave a quick watch of it and can say I am unfamiliar with the potential protest. I will rewatch to give a better answer.

2. Yes I am aware of who Bandera was. I actually made him a point of discussion for one of my questions (question 7). 

Your thoughts on Bucha made me want to stay consistent to that conversation and I was planning to first ask you a question on the situation with Bucha and Irpin. That question number is question 16.

Yes they normally had a village head but those heads had practically no power. We then had agricultural societies which had a little more structure but there wasn't a lot of power in that structure.

Now as for your definition of fascist. It is wrong. No not everyone right of Marx is a fascist.
""Fascism is a form of far-right, authoritarian ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society and the economy that rose to prominence in early 20th-century Europe.""
This is just the quick most understood definition. The reason I am using it is the vast majority use it. Words only have the meaning we give them. Words evolve. Definitions change. Still if you use a different definition from someone else you will be arguing 2 different things.

Now let's break down that definition. ""Fascism is a form of far-right, authoritarian ultranationalism""; this isn't definition authoritarian-right quadrant and thus excludes libertarian left and right and excludes the authoritarian left. Boom we just poked a few holes in your native of ""everyone right of Marx is a Nazi"".
On to the 2nd part of the definition. ""characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society and the economy that rose to prominence in early 20th-century Europe."" These parts are fairly clear and need no clarification

Now let's combine those together. We have some ""on the far right""; This I think can be argued a bit with the intention of changing it's definition. As I think Hitler and Mussolini are more main stream than people realize. For example Hitler was a vegan and cared about animal rights. These 2 things are both most commonly on the left. If you pick everything apart he wasn't and still isn't as far right as the Taliban or Al-Qaeda or even most theocracies such as the Vatican. Mussolini was right of Hitler but both I would say we're basically take Trump or Ronald Reagan and make them more authoritarian and you get Mussolini. Add a little more authoritarian and slightly left (but not by much. As in like .5%) and you get Hitler.

As for the rest it is pretty similar to the definition you used. The biggest issue I have is with you defining everyone as a Nazi that is right of Marx.

This issue I have with calling everyone Nazi is the same with calling everything r*pe. So many people have diluted the definition. Now r*pe still includes the worst thing that can be done to a person but it is not the only thing in there. We have a group of words people should be using instead of r*pe in many circumstances and yet choose to make it sound worse which has gotten the majority to have more doubt to accusations. The words should be s*xual a*sault. 
(Yes I censor myself for 2 reasons. 1 to help weed out the children and to keep from being censored completely over just a few words. Clearly Nazi is ok here but idk about the rest. Even so we don't need kids looking these things up. Not something that kids should be seeing)
Using the word r*pe doesn't instantly cause discust in the same way it used to. Where in the old days someone being accused of r*pe instantly had people looking their way with a if you're guilty we hope for the chair, axe or rope and now that is more like what kind of r*pe.

Important side note I am a historian that was planning on going into politics. I have read the communist manifesto, mien k*mpf and although I did not directly read any books from Mussolini (mostly because I couldn't find any) I did read about him and his ideals.) The same thing as Mussolini for Stalin, Mao, Lenin, etc. I got out of the idea of politics because if a good person goes in they become bad and a bad person going in becomes worse. There are no good people in politics. Hell a perfect example is Ying Zheng/Zhao Zheng which is better known as Qin Shi Huang. Someone who started out as a fairly good king to his own people but was extremely warlike for reasons unknown. Yet after assassination attempts he became more and more doctorial and obsessed with immortality and as such managed to basically break his own empire before he died and was eating mercury and as such died fairly young. This is what allowed for the rise of the Han. Which ultimately fell the same way just taking a few hundred years for China to break again. This is why there is always a joke in world history game let's plays and videos about world history of China breaking and putting itself back together and repeating the cycle. There is some truth to it but ironically that is true in every nation. The USA has followed the same path as Chinese dynasties and so has every other nation. Size is what changes speed. This comes from the rules for rulers. The issue with size is the larger the nation the more keys needed to maintain power and the more keys needed the shorter the reign. This is why small dictatorships are so stable and most of the time are only destabilized when a weak dictator comes into power or outside intervention. Saddam's Iraq was extremely stable for what it was dealing with until America toppled his regime. Which yes Saddam was a bad guy but you have to admit Iraq has basically collapsed without his regime. America has more blood on its hands than it realizes. Think the train problem. A bunch of people standing on the tracks or one. Do nothing and the train hits the group but switch the tracks and you personally chose to have the train hit the one. You can change this scenario any way to decide how much blood is on someone's hands for example the 2 tracks have do nothing and all the people Saddam would of tortured or killed would still receive Saddam's cruelty and kill Saddam. But now what's on the other side of Saddam down the bend. All the people he would have saved. Boom killing Saddam just turned into killing all the people he saved.",760ff5df4dfa1dc2a604304832cd7f6a0660d721,True,False,,,,,0,1649792798,,0,{},i4gyt7n,False,t3_u0p3gv,False,True,t1_i4g7i1g,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/u0p3gv/pro_russian_marine_le_pen_unlikely_to_win_the/i4gyt7n/,1649792815,1,False,True,False,UkraineWarReports,t5_5wncl5,r/UkraineWarReports,public,,0,[],,1649763998.0,,,,

War is a tool to secure your own security yes. Same way the Americans threatened nuclear holocaust because of Cuba. Countries have been invaded for less than wanting to join an enemy alliance. 

&gt;The level of mental gymnastics you have to do to convince yourself that you’re right has to be exhausting.  

Not one bit.

People are starting to wake up to the BS of the country’s leaders.  I thought maybe Russians would do the same but it looks like not enough of them are.

Your argument would hold weight if the west had not invaded Russia 3 times with the last war having the compelete eradication of the Russian people as a goal.

What says that in 100 years when nukes can be shot down with high tech weapons, that you wont go for round 4?

&gt;You guys got fucked up by the Finns, the fucking FINNS!!! (No offense to my Finnish brothers and sisters out there) Do I need to bring up the stats from the Winter War?

No, just ask the germans how bad the Red Army was lol. They still cry about the rape of Berlin. And in the end, Finland surrendered and the USSR got what they asked for and more. Its called sacrifice. 

&gt;Look it up if you want a good laugh. No one is forcing anyone to join NATO. It's a voluntary pact. Another thing: Have you noticed that many of the Eastern Bloc countries have joined NATO since the Soviet Union fell? Don't you think that's a little bit telling? Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Estonia, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, need I go on?

It dosent matter if its voluntary, that has no bearing on the fact that its still a threat. 

&gt;Maybe if the Russian government didn't treat its people like shit, then maybe these countries wouldn't feel the need to jump ship and join NATO as soon as they can. Maybe once you understand that, then maybe you will understand why the whole world hates you.

Uh no. Thats just ahistorical bullshit. Clinton himself said NATO would expand regardless of Russias behaviour, peaceful or not. 

&gt;If NATO decided to put boots on the ground, you would be SLAUGHTERED, and I think you know that.

""Our 30+ country coalition would stomp you hurr hurr"" yeah no shit, the Nazis found out the hard way that fighting the whole developed world dosent turn out well. But Russia has nukes. They have to establish a security sphere while they can, nukes wont always be relevant. In the future they will likely be obsolote and nothing will stop the west from invading Russia again, you already did 3 times. 

 
&gt;Can't even beat a military made up of fucking volunteers and civilians that show more heart and courage than any Russian dipshit over in Ukraine right now 🤣🤣🤣

So i was right? You think Ukraine is winning? Sadly you are mistaken lol, look at any of the warmaps, and the ground is solid now too. The eastern forces are about to be encircled and Mariupol has basically fallen, freeing up 20,000 Russian troops, furthermore 30,000+ troops have been sent into Ukraine and China just delivered weapons in Serbia that will make its way to Russia.

As I show you, even svastika itself was used in many different countries and nations well before Nazi appeared.

The Azov batalion is just one example of Nazism in Ukraine. And no, they use a Nazi symbol after the Nazi appeared, and I didn't say that I hate all of the Ukrainians. The commanders and most of the army are Nazis, there are a lot of proofs and the most visible example is their symbol. They have chevrons and badges that are swastikas and I don't know how you still think they are not Nazis.

&gt;Suggestions to google something about Bandera do not proof your point either. If we would judge Russians by contradicting figures in their history, it will be not productive as well. I hope you do not suggest me to make any assumptions about Russians by Ivan the Terrible or Stalin, do you?

Did you just try to disprove me and not provide any counter proof? ""If they still praise a verified nazi who killed a lot of people they can't be blamed for that!"" Why? Why can't they? Do you think we praise Ivan Grozniy or Stalin as a hero because he (how you like to say) killed a lot of people or starved a lot of people to death? No, they are praised because they won wars, helped our country to not fall on its knees. And what did Stepan Bandera do? Killed a lot of polish and jewish people, wanted to join Nazis, started the hate to Russians, thats what he did.

&gt;Firstly, the Azov batalion has a nazi symbolics literally on them.

This is a lie. If you mean the symbol which resembles ""N"" + ""I"" together, then it is not a svastika. They actually explained its meaning and it has nothing with Nazi symbolism. As you can see, this the original Nazi symbol resembles Slavic symbol for Stribog, the God of Air. [https://symbolikon.com/meanings/slavic-symbols-meanings/](https://symbolikon.com/meanings/slavic-symbols-meanings/) Does that mean for you that all Slavs are Nazi?

By the way, other symbols on that page, like Svarozhich, Hors resemble Nazi Svastika much better and they appeared much earlier then Nazi themselves. You can find a lot of symbols like svastika (which is the most well known nazi symbol). For example, look at this coat of arms. Would you call all members of Boreiko house Nazis because of it?  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boreyko\_coat\_of\_arms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boreyko_coat_of_arms)

So, if you justify your hatred against the entire country just because there is Azov batalion which uses a symbol which looks like a nazi symbol to you, then you are wrong. As I show you, even svastika itself was used in many different countries and nations well before Nazi appeared.

Basically 'pro-russian' as people would call it, I guess. But, however, some of them seem to question all of the information they are being brought to, and some of them just show the battlefield how it is. For example, [https://t.me/karaulny](https://t.me/karaulny) is pretty reliable and questions its news sometimes (but it's on russian). Also they try to question recent news about russian bad-doings, like the Bucha (actually they found a lot of proof this is either staged or done by ukrainian forces). So not just ignoring, but actually answering many things for russians.

Well, I had seen a lot of videos/photos of ""Azov"" batalion having fascist markings/chevrons, from all kinds of sources. And while no redditor either a pro-ukrainian hadn't proven me wrong, I have all rights to believe that. I understand that this can be a staged thing, but seeing them in amateur videos + in videos the Ukrainians film themselves makes me believe it. I'm sure it expands even to Ukrainian Armed Forces as well. I personally believe that a lot of Ukrainian people are normal people and not Nazis, but they seem to have no control over the people that are in charge of them, which are mostly Nazis, so that there are happening warcrimes and other things like that.

India is trying to stay friendly with its old ally without incurring in US sanctions, that would seriously damage the country. I don't think Modhi is up to the task, I'm afraid he'll fuck up sooner or later, with dire consequences for the Indian people. They need to be very careful with what they say and do.

  
your ""some EU"" is Fidesz's Hungary only, and they already lost a money and influence for this. best case scenario for Russia: they kick themselves out of EU and become Belarus 2.0. Nobody in their sane mind would follow.

  
Trump is going to get indicted for the failed coup, I wouldn't count on him taking office anytime soon. Also Republicans and right wing parties in EU are showing the same pattern, pretending they never had anything to do with Putin and the rest of the Russian nazi, with different outcomes.  


in the meantime in Russia: western investments are gone for good, its only power left (the army) has already made a joke of itself losing the battle of Kyiv, and its best ally, China, is playing its own game as usual.

What should Russia do? Let their enemies occupy their borders so they can militarily quarantine them and then work on destablizing them from the inside while using their long range radars and missiles they put in Ukraine and Belarus to spy on and threathen Russia?

They still lack in aircraft carriers even if they have several in the production now but in my opinion carriers are abosolete today and are just big targets for hypersonic anti ship missiles and torpedos. Soon China will have so many new and high quality warships that USA will have big problems if those fleets would meet in a battle. 

I don't know anything about their army or airforce other than that they can produce a lot of equipement of good quality by now. They don't need to copy and steal others designes any longer. They can build a several units faster and cheaper than USA/EU and they have a lot of manpower. They are efficiant while many manufacturers in USA/EU are corrupt and slow. 

Everything is pointing at the moment that we could have WW3 in the near future. With or without nukes. If one block attack the other and nukes are not used in defence then they will become obsolete. Nobody will dare to use them. 

Wests technological advantage is not as high at it was decades ago while the east have a lot of equipement of good quality today and can outproduce the west and do it in unpresidented speed.

China will do a lot to keep Putin in power because they need a ally in this part of the world. They are stronger together. But China also depends on trade with the west so they will play cat and mouse game as long as possible. 

We could already be beyond the point where a new world war can be avoided. It's just a matter of time and the winner will take it all...And we will have one global empire.

Are there any Telegram channels you recommend I follow? I have also used Getty Images to look at photojournalism. Some of the pictures have stories to them where I do think some are true, but I could notice the possibilities where photojournalism could be staged. For instance, some photos I find are pictures of a teddy bear with blood on it, conveniently placed in a destructive setting (under a destroyed car tire, sitting in rubble). While I greatly do believe children of this war are suffering tremendously from the violence around them, I also don't count out the possibility that items of ""interest"" might be placed for added ""shock"" value. As a photographer myself, I know that pictures will tend to succeed when there is a subject sticking out in an environment. Furthermore, you mention video being the best form of evidence and I agree with you on that. I always prefer video, even if it is too hard to look at. It gives a real sense of perspective. It is why I enjoy security camera footage and video documentation. However, even security cameras and video documentation are victim to falseness if you pay attention to the right details - however, falsifying evidence in video is much harder than other forms of media.

5. I have seen some comments from yourself and from others about the Azov battalions' affiliation with Nazi ideology. Let's state the loose definition that a Nazi means ""nationalistic socialist"". Now let's assume here that when we refer to someone being a Nazi, it means that the person has adopted the doctrine beliefs of the Nazi party - meaning there is belief of a race superiority with the likelihood of blaming Jewish people for their quarrels. If you wish to expand on this definition and state that there is a growing sense of fascism in the Azov battalion, I will allow it for this context. I personally believe that all armed forces in the world contain extremists - some with Nazi sympathies and some with other extremist beliefs. These soldiers are killers. It is not unbelievable to think that some Nazis may exist in the regiments of Ukrainian Armed Forces. However, many troops I have spoken with do not have Nazi beliefs and simply are volunteering to defend their country from invading forces. I have also seen and heard testaments from other troops about the tremendous effort the Azov battalion are putting up to help push off invading forces for the good of people. I do not know the true numbers of extremist in Ukrainian forces, but do not believe there are zero. Are you able to discuss more about your information on the Nazi-affiliates in Azov or in Ukrainian Armed Forces? Do you believe the majority of people fighting for Ukraine are Nazis? Do you believe the mercenaries who volunteered to fight for Ukraine are Nazis?",62cae936a68dea72c1a0cec751d4977c8d2f5380,True,False,,,,,0,1649775842,,0,{},i4fppcn,False,t3_u119iq,False,True,t1_i4fi33u,/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/u119iq/russian_nazism_must_be_destroyed_forever/i4fppcn/,1649775860,1,False,True,False,UkraineWarReports,t5_5wncl5,r/UkraineWarReports,public,,0,[],,1649747042.0,,,,

Personally I wouldn't reccomend relying on photojournalism, as it may be staged or a photo made with a different context. I'd say that videorecordings is the thing that makes hard to lie.

Right now in Russia I can even access pro-ukrainian or russophobe media, the only thing that is blocked for me and actually made me use VPN is Twitter (not really for politics) and Kahoot (which is a school app/site). Not worrying about Twitter, which I don't use a lot, but the thing that really matters here is Kahoot owners shutting down Kahoot for Russia. The same teacher as I described earlier had a subscription there that costed around 3000 roubles, and now he can't use it (he can get access to his account with a VPN, but he can't host a game in our school as you can't get VPN on a school smart-board (idk how it is called, basically big screen with internet access that replaces old green school boards)).

Not all of NATO supports Ukraine

The most military powerful EU country is worryingly close to Russia and has delivered very little direct support to Ukraine.

There's nothing new about the approach Putin is taking to control the country. And he's borrowed more from Hitler than Alexander the Great that he says he worships so much....His ruthless elimination of all competing media and political opposition is right out of Facist Dictator 101. And in any other context he'd be very worried about how the western democracies would act against him, except he possesses 6,000 ICBMs, which changes the whole equation. For the West must decide if he is really crazy enough to use them as he watches his Ukraine scenario degrade into total humiliation for him and Russia. 

Today he said he was prepared to take greater risk in engaging with the US over Ukraine. Is that a bluff ? I don't know, but that he appointed the Butcher of Syria as his new top general in Ukraine means Putin is ready to unleash massive genocide over eastern Ukraine: saying to the world that he fears nothing in doing so. If there was any doubt before, this places Russia squarely in the ranks of the Nazis in WWII that murdered millions of Jews. 

The key to all of this is how long can Putin's evil, corrupt machine be tolerated by the Russian people. I fear thousands there will have to perish trying to bring about change. Only after that happens might the Russian Army turn on him. And even in that scenario, one has to wonder if the Russian Army has enough honor left to make such a move, for it is no longer the vaunted Army of Stalingrad,  but has been degraded under Putin into nothing more than a giant civilian killing machine that will stop at nothing to survive.

Many people don’t do this enough. We’re all victims to information bias in an age where so much information is at our disposal that it becomes to difficult to verify truths. 

You’re very smart for doing that. I have friends who use Telegram, too. I have not used Telegram. I have mainly watched security cameras provided online because I would much rather see the situation than read about it. I work with charities and speak to people in Ukraine on the situation. I also think photojournalism is much more reliable then words because it makes it harder to show lies. However, I will admit my emotions over this conflict do get the best of me on exaggerated reports. And there has been a lot of propaganda on both sides. I believe Reddit is filled with support for Ukraine which drowns out the ability for any opposing views. The same problem exists with politics in my residing country.

So the next question I have because I am curious to know..

4. I have heard some people in Russia needing to use a VPN to access more media. Maybe this is something I should consider for myself.

Ukraine signed a document written in their language, Russia signed one in their language and the UK US in their language.

What the document says in other languages, I don’t know. 


“a hopeful and historic breakthrough that enhances the security of all three participants.”- Bill Clinton 


La Times 1-11-94

“Ukraine, politically and economically unstable since it became an independent state after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, has 176 intercontinental missiles armed with some 1,240 nuclear warheads--all aimed at the United States. It also has 592 nuclear warheads aboard bombers, which would be covered by the agreement.”

Ukraine  had 1,832 nuclear warheads.
176 intercontinental missiles.

Doesn’t look like it enhanced the security of Ukraine.

“Under the agreement, the United States, Russia and Britain will provide security assurances for Ukraine when it gives up its weapons and becomes an adherent of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Ukraine”

That was the security enhancement Bill Clinton spoke of.

“the most crucial non-proliferation challenge facing the world”

Ukrainian warheads are dismantled. The world is much safer. 
Nuclear proliferation in Ukraine is an issue no longer.

The United States Of America gave security assurances to the Ukrainian people. 

Ukraine is under America’s protection. 
This is what sets us apart, this is American excellence.
