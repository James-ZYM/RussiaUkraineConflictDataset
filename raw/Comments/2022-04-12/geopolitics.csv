[],False,,michaelfox99,,,[],,,,text,t2_o75j3,False,False,"*Finland for instance shares one of the longest borders with Russia in Europe, joining NATO would mean bringing a huge amount of political and military tension between the two countries and what they represent.*

Tensions, yes, but actual military conflict becomes vastly less likely. That's the point. Certainly, it's a tradeoff, which is why there is still a substantial minority of Finns and Swedes opposed to NATO membership. So far, Russia has not reacted all that strongly to the upsurge in Finnish/Swedish NATO talk, which is likely leading Finland and Sweden to see rather limited downside here. 

*Wouldn’t this further motivate Putin to attempt an “eastern alliance” with the global south and expand all the way next to the US borders i.e Cold War 2.0 with NATO of some sorts*

Russia has relatively few 'friends' around the world. They have a few true allies, and then a larger set of countries that simply see Russia as a convenient counter to Western dominance. None of these latter countries are interested in forming an alliance with Russia that is remotely as deep as NATO. You can get a pretty good sense of who Russia's friends are by looking at the recent UN General Assembly vote to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Only five countries voted against the resolution, and none of them are located in the Americas. So no, Russia's hypothetical global alliance would not get anywhere near the US's borders. Even if Russia could convince a Cuba or Venezuela to beef up military installations in the Americas, the capabilities just aren't there. Cuba/Venezuala are themselves quite weak and Russia just doesn't have the resources to seriously arm them while maintaining adequate defense at home. Russia isn't the Soviet Union.

The US could only do what it did in Japan and Germany because both countries were completely defeated and unable to resist. They were in ruins, under military occupation, and many of their leaders were on trial for war crimes.

By contrast, 1991 Russia was only in ""ruins"" in the sense that their economic policy had been completely nonsensical for decades. They were not under occupation, no leaders from the communist regime were brought to justice, and the new Russian leadership was committed to Russia retaining its full independence of action from the West. If you look into many of the decisions that Yeltsin made in the 90s, it was primarily to listen to the western advisors that would help him stay in power rather than the ones that would help him build a better Russia.

The kind of rebuilding from the West in 1991 that would have brought about a different Russia would have required some sort of surrender and temporary relinquishment of sovereignty to westerners. Western assistance would have been needed in the writing of a constitution, in privatization efforts, and in the form of much needed aid to the population as they suffered through the process. Yeltsin was ultimately unsuited for this role because he was interested in retaining power, and most others would have been as well.

While Russia is certainly not rich  , extremely poor is nonsense. Their GDP per capita PPP is still a healthy 29000$. According to the ranking they are even above Malaysia too tbf. Heck they are far above China which is only 18000$. 

I have been to Russia and certain developing Asian countries like Philippines.  Russia could have been a lot richer if they didn't put up with their Putinist oligarchy I don't deny that , but calling them extremely poor is nonsense. Every country even the richest ones has some sort of deprivation for their population. Russia while certainly poorer than West is far richer than most Asian developing countries except for the Gulf States probably. 

I have seen ghettos in Russian cities ranging from Moscow to small cities like Tolyatti. At the same time I have seen those dreadful abomination of slums( with some watery pool and all)  in Manila Philippines which will make your eyes crack. 

While  Russian ghettos are certainly not pleasant(Moscow ones are still fine but the ones in Siberia get really rough) it is still extremely incomparable and no where near as insane  to the destitution I saw in Manila slums in Phillipines. And Manila is supposed to it's capital the best city . Just imagine how rest of the Phillipines will be???

Its something completely different and the Chinese know this. Its, we Americans that believe in this Cold War narrative and China will take us to the cleaners if we continue to think this way. They use the term against us and we go along with it. This is why I believe this.

These are just my thoughts so dont get all outta wack if you disagree. I like a good debate and I am open to new ideas. That is why I love Reddit. I actually learn stuff here, as opposed to the comment section on Breitbart or HuffPost. Thats trash.

1. We cant isolate China like we did the USSR. Our economies are interconnected by the hip. Russia was a third rate economic power during the Cold War and are a third rate economic power now, take away their oil and they are a weak nation that cant even defend itself. 
2. The military balance and situation is COMPLETELY different.  During the Cold War we were trying to roll back communism and protect Western liberal democracies. Our forces were face to face and on a hair trigger. The current military showdown is still nuclear in nature but at any given time we have maybe a few naval vessels playing cat and mouse games in the South China Sea. This is about technology and specifically artificially intelligence. Like the race for the Nuke its now the race for AI and even Artificial SuperIntelligence (ASI). 
3. The Cold War was an ideological war.  This is a war over economic domination. Yes, in a sense the Cold War was about economic domination but the USA and the West had that wrapped up on 8May 1945 when Germany surrendered. The US has been the worlds dominate economic power ever since. Until the recent rise of the PRC.
4.  Its a hybrid type of Cold War where economic relations will remain strong until if, or when something finally breaks this relationship. When that happens it will be bad for both sides. And no one knows what is going to happen and to believe we know what's going to happen is fool hardy.

Yes, America continues trade with China **a) because of the dependency caused by US companies moving production to China**, a process which occurred long before Xi Xingping came to power. When human rights were in a far better state than now, and China was far closer to the West **b) there is no current seriously compelling geopolitical reason to go against China yet.** Sanctions hurt everyone, from the country implementing them to civilians and the intended targets (Iran being the best example). You need a very strong reason to implement them, also to have the political support of your own country.

While the US cannot cut trade with China meaningfully fast, make no mistake that the trade relationship between the US and China is becoming more hostile. The US still has very unfair [tariffs on certain products](https://www.worldbank.org/en/data/interactive/2021/03/02/temporary-trade-barriers-database) against China.

This is also not a normal situation with Russia, while China's issues are internal, Russia has violated international law and committed atrocities in Ukraine. While it is each country's right to do business with whom they please. It is also clear that the US and Europe cannot stay out of this conflict since it is so close to home. 

India is unfortunately in a bad situation, because although Russia has a good relationship with India.

As such there was never a full hearted effort to incorporate Russia into the world economy like was done following WW2 via the Marshall plan. The US destroyed Japan, but instead of making them pay reparations or whatnot, decided to invest heavily and created a thriving society there. Likewise Western Europe recovered quickly from WW2 and became very prosperous.

The same was not done in Russia which is why anti-Western sentiment has been bubbling there since the fall of the USSR.

Russian military is weak compared to the _US_ military. Ukraine had the largest army in Europe: 300k troops, plenty of Soviet tanks, and 5 times more anti-air defences than post-1999 NATO countries combined. Their military went from infiltrated, utterly incompetent force to NATO-capable military thanks to all the training and support from the US, UK and Poland.

As for Western Europe, only the UK, France and Poland are remotely prepared for any kind of military action, yet France isn't keen on fighting Russia, as the French elites perceive Russians as allies when it comes to pushing out American influence out of Europe. The French government will be neutral at best, slightly pro-Russian at worst. Not to mention multiple influential corporations in France get their cheap labor needs satisfied by Russian factories. The second-most influential leader in France, Le Pen, says out loud that sanctions on Russia should be removed.

The UK can help out only with their Air Force, as their land component is quite small, which is understandable for an island.

Poland is eager to be Europe's Israel, but they are not ready. It will take years for M1A2 SEPv3 Abrams tanks, F-35s and HIMARS launchers to be fully operational. Their air defence is effectively nonexistent. 

In order to contain Russia militarily, the US has two options: put heavy armor division (or two) in rotational bases for a couple of years, so sanctions can do their job, or to arm Poland to the teeth:

* Transfer old Abrams tanks there, even the 1990 version is loads better than their oldest part of armored forces: 300 T72M1 tanks.
* Bring them into nuclear sharing agreement.
* Give/sell them long-range conventional missiles. It's easy to roll in Ukraine, while it's a whole other story when a thermobaric warhead can fall on the Kremlin. 

Besides these countries, Western Europe does not care about their military capability because they assume Russians would have to go through Poland and Germany first, which the US will not allow to happen.

Germany itself would love nothing more than push the US out of Europe, sell out the Central-East Europe for natural gas and oil from Putin, and prop up Chinese economy with preferential trade deals with Xi. It's worth noting the German goverment was hoping for a quick Russian victory and denied any help to the Ukrainians until it's become clear UKR is not gonna fold.
Not to mention that Germany effectively has **no** military capable of intervention, some experts even speculate that Poland could seize Berlin in a week. That means no help from Germoney should anything happen.



&gt; economy

The problem is that Russian hydrocarbons are not subject to crises. They're always gonna be there, waiting to be sold. Also, the Russian population is not used to the Western standard of living. Outside the five biggest cities, Russian Federation is effectively a 3rd world country. 25% of Russians don't have a toilet in their house, while 50% [cannot even afford shoes](https://www.rferl.org/a/putin-poverty-inflation/31429514.html).

[],False,,IneffectiveNotice,,,[],,,,text,t2_b5ub4x5g,False,False,"&gt; it has also exposed the weakness of the Russian military

Russian military is weak when compared to the _US_ military. Ukraine had the largest army in Europe: 300k troops, plenty of Soviet tanks, and 5 times more anti-air defences than post-1999 NATO countries combined.

In the rest ofEurope, only the UK, France and Poland are remotely prepared for any kind of military action, yet France isn't keen on fighting Russia, as the French elites perceive Russians as allies when it comes to pushing out American influence out of Europe. The French government will be neutral at best, slightly pro-Russian at worst. Not to mention multiple influential corporations in France get their cheap labor in Russian factories.

The UK can help out only with their Air Force, as their land component is quite small, which is understandable for an island.

Poland is eager to be Europe's Israel, but they are not ready. It will take years for M1A2 SEPv3 Abrams tanks, F-35s and HIMARS launchers to be fully operational. Their air defence is effectively nonexistent. 

In order to contain Russia militarily, the US has two options: put heavy armor division (or two) in rotational bases for a couple of years, so sanctions can do their job, or to arm Poland to the teeth:
* Transfer old Abrams tanks there, even the 1990 version is loads better than their oldest part of armored forces: 300 T72M1 tanks.
* Bring them into nuclear sharing agreement.
* Give/sell them long-range conventional missiles. It's easy to roll in Ukraine, while it's a whole other story when a thermobaric warhead can fall on the Kremlin. 

Besides these countries, Western Europe does not care about their military capability because they assume Russians would have to go through Poland and Germany first, which the US will not allow to happen.

Germany itself would love nothing more than push the US out of Europe, sell out the Central-East Europe for natural gas and oil from Putin, and prop up Chinese economy with preferential trade deals with Xi. It's worth noting the German goverment was hoping for a quick Russian victory and denied any help to the Ukrainians until it's become clear UKR is not gonna fold.
Not to mention that Germany effectively has **no** military capable of intervention, some experts even speculate that Poland could seize Berlin in a week. That means no help from Germoney should anything happen.

European Russia has forced the entirety of non-european Russia into a war, and it's the non-european parts of Russia that will likely suffer the most - as they are the poorest, least connected ones with the least alternatives.

This sort of thing has happened many times throughout history, where the core powerful regions drag an entire bloc into a war, one that the rest of the bloc do not desire, and eventually the bloc falls apart after they suffer enough damage economically.

In these outer regions 'warlords' will emerge, and push for independence, and push for a system where they the warlord become powerful, and they can monopolize the resources in the region, rather than send everything to the core regions, for the core regional powers to enjoy.

All this supposes of course that western media is right and Russia loses heavily in the long run, something I'm not super sure is going to happen. It's debatable if US/EU have done enough damage to Russia and as a consequence Russia might 'get away with it'.",0e44cb510f9b6827a56f396a0ab23cfa163b7027,True,False,,,,,0,1649779638,,0,{},i4fzobs,False,t3_u1i8fk,False,True,t3_u1i8fk,/r/geopolitics/comments/u1i8fk/do_you_think_the_upcoming_turmoil_in_russia_could/i4fzobs/,1649779656,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649750838.0,

""For three decades, U.S. foreign policy has run on inertia and called it strategy. The Cold War had ended, but the United States nonetheless retained its Cold War alliances. The Soviet Union had disappeared, but the absence of a major threat produced much the same prescription as the presence of a major threat had: just as the U.S. military had defended “the free world,” now it would become the guardian of the whole world. When problems appeared, successive administrations generally took them as reasons to expand U.S. deployments. Even if its bid for primacy had created or exacerbated those problems, Washington had the solution: more and better primacy.  
Now the war in Ukraine is tempting policymakers to repeat that mistake in an exceedingly consequential way. Just when President Joe Biden had been trying to prioritize security in Asia and prosperity for the American middle class, advocates of U.S. primacy are seizing this emotionally charged moment to insist that post–Cold War path dependency prevail. Rather than pivot to Asia, they argue, the United States must now build up its military presence in Europe to contain an assertive Russia, even as it strengthens its Indo-Pacific defenses to contain a rising China. They admit their proposal would cost hundreds of billions of dollars more in defense spending and put U.S. forces on the front lines of two potential great-power wars, but they think the price is worth it.  
The Biden administration should decline this invitation to wage a risky global cold war. Although the invasion of Ukraine has revealed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s willingness to take risks in the pursuit of aggression, it has also exposed the weakness of the Russian military and economy. If anything, the war has strengthened the case for strategic discipline, by offering a chance to encourage Europe to balance against Russia while the United States concentrates on security in Asia and renewal at home. Such a division of labor is fair and sustainable. It would put the United States in the best position to limit the fallout from the war in Ukraine and achieve long-term peace and stability in Europe and beyond. Primacy’s lure is strong in Washington, but a more restrained approach is better.""",f5635823424e9126d13b0bf826c4f345ca5a16e8,True,False,,,,,0,1649773622,,0,{},i4fk3am,True,t3_u20cie,False,True,t3_u20cie,/r/geopolitics/comments/u20cie/the_ukraine_temptation_biden_should_resist_calls/i4fk3am/,1649773636,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649744822.0,

[],False,,Mejlkungens,,,[],,,,text,t2_9yhirz7c,False,False,"The way you phrased this question makes me doubt if you are asking in good faith. But I'll bite anyway with some thoughts:

1. Even though I think Sweden and Finland ultimately will (and if you ask me, should) join, it is not as inevitable as it may seem in international media. The swedish government have been more careful in their communication compared to Finland.

2. In terms of pure military capacity I am not sure Sweden actually gains all that much from joining NATO. There are already pretty extensive military cooperation treaties with the other Nordic countries, US and UK to name a few. Swedish military hardware and doctrine is already highly interoperable with NATO standards. Relations with these countries are also very strong (not alliance level strong, but definitely deeper than just ""friendly""). 

3. I think the calculus has fundamentally changed. There might not be a whole lot to gain (in terms of de facto military capacity) from joining NATO. But, more importantly, there is no longer anything to lose. The invasion of Ukraine killed whatever trust or hope there was of building fruitful relations with Russia (which I believe was an important driver in the more neutral approach to NATO). 

4. I would argue that the phrasing of article 5 (an attack on one is an attack on all) in itself is a stronger commitment than EU article 42 (if one is attacked we all agree to help). My point being: Attack NATO and you are at war with 30 countries. Attack EU and you are at war with one that has the support of many (to the best of their ability). 

5. While France is no slouch, NATO has the backing of the undefeated, undisputed P4P military champion. 

6. EU lacks military coordination and interoperability. NATO offers this and a much better command structure.

Many analysts expected the Ukrainian resistance to crumble under the Russian pressure and resort to guerrilla within a matter of weeks. Until now the Ukrainians manage to hold the front, but meanwhile it is worth exploring the feasibility of a guerrilla. In order to better understand this possibility it is sensible to make the comparison with two successful guerrilla wars – Vietnam and Afghanistan.
 
First both Vietnam and Afghanistan were covered with unhospitable terrain – jungle and mountains. Ukraine on the other hand is flatland with little opportunity for concealment, except for the border region in the far west. Second, the counterinsurgent troops in Vietnam and Afghanistan were mostly of another ethnicity. This made it easy for the guerrilla forces to recognize the enemy, while it was difficult for the occupying forces to distinguish friend from foe. In the case of Ukraine insurgents don’t have this advantage as Russians and Ukrainians are almost indistinguishable.
 
This hooks also into my next point - language and cultural barriers. It was hard for the Americans in Vietnam and the Russians in Afghanistan to actually understand the people they were supposed to police. This eased communication among insurgents and made it hard for the occupying forces to judge the situation around them. In Ukraine the Russians can understand the Ukrainians without any problem and this makes it easy to police their speech, writings and communication channels.
 
Another aspect is the support of allies. North Vietnam was supported by China and the Sovjet-Union, while Afghan rebels were supplied by the United States. Ukraine is currently supported by NATO. This large-scale support in arms and funding is essential for any successful resistance. This is what Ukraine has done so far. The downside is that the Ukraine does not have what I would call a porous border, a border which is long and transparent enough to allow forces and supply into the country, like in Vietnam and Afghanistan.
 
Ukraine is practically boxed in from three sides by hostile territory and forces and the western border is relatively easy to control as it is the only conduit. This makes a nation-wide guerrilla very difficult, because it will be hard to move supplies deep inside Ukraine, especially beyond the Dnjepr river. A guerrilla can be waged in the west where the support for the Ukrainian state is the most firm and due its proximity to Western allies, but a long-term prospects for a guerrilla are generally slim, especially if NATO probably does not want border incidents with Russian forces.",ce6195bacc2e14cc196e781515041a09ccbf76bc,True,False,,,,,0,1649763827,,0,{},i4ez5mj,True,t3_u1wody,False,True,t3_u1wody,/r/geopolitics/comments/u1wody/ukraine_2022_is_a_guerrilla_war_feasible/i4ez5mj/,1649763843,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649735027.0,

However, it also means that they do not have to get entangled in foreign adventures, unless they decide they need to. So neutrality gives them a degree of freedom in international relations and the knowledge that if they have to fight, they do so in direct defence of their fatherland, which should translate into high morale. Additional benefits are that they are more likely to be seen by others as neutral parties, which can help them in a role as mediator. It was no accident that the Helsinki Accords were signed in Finland. 

The downsides of neutrality are that they are likely to be on their own against an aggressor state, with no guarantees of military help from abroad. Even if they would fight valiantly, they may still lose against larger powers in the end and/or endure steep losses. Also, they always have to consider the interests and possible actions of more powerful states in conducting their foreign policies.

Until now, most Finns and Swedes felt that the benefits of neutrality outweighed the downsides overall. Yet with the Russian aggression against Ukraine, the downsides have become clearer. There are now small majorities in each country in favour of accession to NATO. Interestingly enough, those numbers climb even further if respondents consider that both countries accede at the same time. I would expect that if they do apply to NATO, they will do so together at the same time.

NATO officials disputed this and stated that the US bases were not intended as permanent and thus could not be seen as a breach.

Putin knows if he brings up the thing he is right about (the violation of the treaty) people will (quite rightly) respond with, 'That doesn't justify war in Ukraine.' Meanwhile NATO doesn't want to bring it up, because they did violate it.

Instead he has quoted NATO expansion as people instead will get bogged down arguing over if NATO expansion violated a promise, instead of the actual important point of ""Even if it did, it doesn't justify war in Ukraine.""

2) It's easy to die, so 99% of an educated populace will refuse to fight. Even then, they will only agree to fight vs backward enemy forces, and even then it can be surprisingly easy to be killed.

3) Even if you conquer, you need workers to extract resources. You also have to worry about occupation and longer run maintenance costs and fighting against revolutionary forces - these add up without going full brutality, and if you do, there'll be diplomatic costs.

4) 3 is pointless, because 99% of resources have been psuedo-plentiful throughout the last century thanks to exploiting plentiful fossil fuels and science and technological gains.

If conquests return, it'll be over resource scarcity problems rather than anything that happens in Ukraine.
It'll depend more on how good humanities scientists are at creating new energy sources/resources to reduce selfishness and greed thanks to technological derived abundance.",e617e85855914c8335fa2fc5040aac92939719da,True,False,,,,,0,1649724843,,0,{},i4d8j7p,False,t3_u192nt,False,True,t3_u192nt,/r/geopolitics/comments/u192nt/the_return_of_conquest_why_the_future_of_global/i4d8j7p/,1649724857,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1649696043.0,
