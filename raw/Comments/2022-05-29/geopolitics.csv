For powering stationary things, like military bases and it infrastructure, they most likely will (and i believe already are) switching over to renewables for the cost savings; i just highly doubt that any vehicles (tanks, planes, ships, afv, etc) will use anything other than gas to power them. Maybe ships in the future will use renewable powered batteries for slow, long distance travel, but then switch to oil if ever they need to double-time/do battle/etc (sorta similar to the first oil/coal powered ships which used sails for slow, long distance travel, and oil/coal for high speed maneuvers), but i dont ever see fighter jets, cargo planes, tanks, afvs, etc using renewables/batteries as their sole energy source (unless theres a huge jump in battery pack energy density, which seems highly unlikely unless they use some crazy exotic battery chemistry (like Na-F batteries or something, Li's energy density is nowhere near comparable to oil, and we're already close to the theoretical max energy density for Li with our current Li ion batteries).

Australian nuclear submarines changed the game, China relies too much on oil being shipped overseas, and there is no way on Earth that India will put up with the Chinese Navy securing that trade route and boxing them out of their own shores.

Besides, the oil route China uses is a pirate's dream if unsecured, and securing that line is incredibly long and would require a sizeable presence that would mess with US/Indian trade, and if it even so much as annoys the US then the US Navy just parks themselves in between and cuts China off from the vast, vast, vast majority of the oil they receive.

Zeihan's claim is that after WWII, the US made a deal with the non-Soviet world. For everyone who joined in its effort to contain the Soviets, it would provide all the benefits of empire, including safe trade, security, and access to a massive consumer market. Countries would have to give up their own empires and stop fighting each other, because the US guaranteed everyone's safety.

That has been enormously expensive. It's not just the navy, but also the occasional wars, jumping in to protect practically any nation under attack. Vietnam was mainly an exercise of this policy. For a while, the US could easily afford it because its GDP was such a large percentage of the world's. Now it's less so, and with the Soviets gone, there's less reason to continue.

That opens up possibilities for other countries to fight each other without US interference. The wars that result will disrupt trade. 

It also means other countries will have to use their own navies to protect their own trade, unless that trade is with the US. Some countries will be capable of that (e.g. France and Japan) and others less so. Some countries are natural trading partners with the US, others not so much. Some countries are heavily dependent on global trade, others aren't. Overall, things get really messy. No other country has a navy capable of protecting all global trade like the US does.

So I agree completely that outsourcing manufacturing to China was a huge mistake, but at the same time US industry - and all industry - relies on global supply chains in order to be efficient. The US has many great advantages in terms of natural resources, but  comparative advantage is just economic fact and most supply chains simply wouldn't function without the ability to outsource to some extent. We messed up with China because the Chinese government are untrustworthy, but outsourcing when it makes economic sense is not a bad thing.

Housing prices are more of a demand side issue and could be solved by de-urbanization which I think will be a trend we'll see over the next few decades. Wage growth is stable and rises with inflation, the issue is housing prices that have massively outpaced inflation. This is not a US-only problem as China has a housing bubble many times worse than even the US, and China has enjoyed the strongest wage growth in the world over the last 30 years.

  
""Russia, is a land power, and so is China. Their largest threats have historically been land based and even though they consider the US to be their enemy now, they still have too many hostile neighbors to ever be able to send their navies away to project power.""

If that is the case, which it may be, then I still don't see globalization ending as there aren't really any powers that would benefit from threatening global trade, or at least not any powers that have navies big enough to be any issue. Europeans are the dominant powers in their region, so will have no issue policing their own shipping lanes. The Japanese and Indians and maybe the Australians will be able to police the Asian shipping lanes, and if China is not going to be a naval power, then this is even easier. The Panama canal is under pretty much direct control. The Suez could maybe be an issue, but it is close enough to Europe and Turkey that I hardly find it likely that Egypt could suddenly shut off the Suez and not face retribution, not that it would have any reason to do that anyway.

What you are seeing isn't a change, it's a return to the historic norm.  And I mean, historic.  Free trade and security from a benevolent (by historic standards) superpower is so outside the norm is insane.  It's only existed for 70 years (30 if you don't count the cold war era) and all of history before that was empires and spheres of influence.

Let's go through the points.  The US does benefit from free trade and policing the trade lanes, but that does not outweigh the costs of such a policy.  The military cost alone is staggering, but the civilian cost is worse.  Americans, are largely rich by world standards and it's a wealthy, large nation, you can find almost everything you need for manufacturing and energy locally.  As such, the US does not need the rest of the world for trade.  Just North America.  But instead of manufacturing domestically and providing jobs and capital to Americans, we have invested and built all over the world.  This has led to real wage shrinkage and lowering the standard of living.  Why can't you buy a house like your parents?  Part of the reason is because Nike isn't making their shoes here.  Sure we get cheap goods, but the value of our money drops more than the cost recuped, it's a losing proposition for everyone but the upper class.

While the US does have a decent little export racket, the majority of that goes to, you guessed it, Mexico and Canada.  We should be focusing on them, specifically, Mexico.  ALL our low end manufacturing should be proudly made in Mexico.  But we should also demand a very competitive wage for the Mexican worker, not only will this make American manufacturing more competitive, but it raises the standard of living in Mexico, which would lead to them buying more goods from THEIR largest trade partner.  

Us.

The US populace is s l o w l y catching on to the fact that Bretton Woods helps Europe and Asia and the upper class and no one else.  And the parties are texting accordingly.  

So economics settled then?

The US doesn't need to justify it's Naval Supremacy to anyone but the taxpayer.  If we want 11 super carriers, no one is going to be able to prevent us from having them.  Conversely, Russia and China will never be able to field reliable navies that can shape the geopolitical order.  NEVER.

Russia, is a land power, and so is China.  Their largest threats have historically been land based and even though they consider the US to be their enemy now, they still have too many hostile neighbors to ever be able to send their navies away to project power.  Consider the UK and US, what dot hey have in common?  Isolated with weak neighbors.  Which allowed them to send their navy abroad, rather than have it defend their homeland.  China and Russia have many neighbors, some not so weak, most of which hate them.  Add to that, special hellish considerations.  Russia has no warm water ports.  The best they have is Sevastapol, which is locked in first at the Bosporus, then at either Egypt or Spain.  That's not a good situation if you want to project power.  China has no deep water ports and is completely surrounded by the first island chain.  We know where their subs are 100% of the time.  There are unsinkable aircraft carriers around their entire country.  Without Taiwan, there is no escape from the mainland, and even with Taiwan, it's a narrow pass to defend.

There are no other navies worth considering except Japan, and Japan doesn't have the interest.  

Navies done.

The US can be selective with their allies and they should be.  Germany doesn't deserve what they have.  They don't pay for it, we do.  They aren't grateful, either.  Let them reap what they have sown.   The middle east doesn't WANT to share our values.  Let them stay in the dark ages. Let Poland, Japan and others who value their alliance with American have priority.  And many many Americans, feel the same. 

I already covered manufacturing, but there is nothing the US needs that can't be found in our home soil or in the western hemisphere, which will remain in our sphere.  The US produces more food than almost any other place in the world.  We have abundant water, and plenty of energy.

China, as I said before, definitely can not defend the trade lanes, nor would they be trusted to do so.    Instead a return to empires and alliances would occur.

It seems like you merely skimmed Zeihands books.  He covers all this.  Return to empires, alliances, America being selective with it's power and interests.

But for scale; the US navy consists of over 300k active personnel and over 480 ships in active service with more than 90 in production, so the size of the US navy is increasing, NOT being scaled back.

This seems to be referring to the same statistic you are citing; if you read it more carefully, these 24 ships are old ships that are being decommissioned in favour of new ones, and the size of the overall budget is increasing, not decreasing, and is rising faster than inflation. Even if they were cutting all these ships and cutting 3.6 billion dollars like you say, the US naval budget is $230 billion, so it's really peanuts, and that is not what the article is saying.

My point was more about public perception of the US navy; I have not heard of many people that want the US to decomission its navy and stop policing global shipping lanes. There is talk all the time about ending intervention in the middle east, and this has basically happened at this point and in my view is a good thing. But these interventions were not the things holding global trade together, what holds that together is US naval supremacy, and no one on either side of the political aisle really has any desire to see that come to an end.",2f8a6ffcfe3cb83fc27ec5a755de4183f94c9e0b,True,False,,,,,0,1653830740,,0,{},iafakfb,True,t3_uzzs7x,False,True,t1_iaf9msv,/r/geopolitics/comments/uzzs7x/i_have_great_respect_for_peter_zeihan_but_do_not/iafakfb/,1653830750,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1653801940.0

Of course they trade with one another, but my point is that with the exception of maybe Germany most European countries are not net exporters and thus don't really benefit economically as much as an exporting nation like China or the US.

&gt; it is entirely possible that Russia or China could begin a naval buildup and begin to project force outside of their spheres of influence

He considers that very unlikely. First of all, both Russia and China have rapidly shrinking populations. Second, their navies are not even close to capable of reaching the US. Third, if China lost the access to global shipping lanes, naval buildup with be the least of its worries since China would starve within months. China is the biggest crude importer in the world and Russia's pipelines are running at their maximum already. In order for tankers to go from the Strait of Hormuz, they have to go through the spheres of influence of India, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philipines, Vietnam, Taiwan and Japan. Disruptions would have massive impacts on energy and food security of China.

&gt; I find it highly unlikely that the US would just let Europe, Japan or other allies fend for themselves just because trading with them happens to no longer benefit the US.

He addresses that in his books. The US would be isolationist, not sleeping.

&gt; The food sector for example; while America is one of the world's largest agricultural exporters, its agricultural industry still depends on massive imports from other countries, and many foodstuffs are not produced within the borders of the US and are imported. If the US were suddenly unable to import fertilizer, then this would result in a major decline in agricultural output.

Fertilizer that's imported from Canada. How much of the foodstuffs is important from NAFTA as opposed to the rest of the world?

&gt; I would wager that a European navy is more than capable of projecting power as far as Africa and the middle east, so the Europeans would be more than capable of ensuring trade flows through the Atlantic and Mediterranean sea

Again, addressed in his books. France would look back at its former colonies, the UK has Norway, Italy has the Mediterranean. What about Germany, for example?

These sorts of claims are not just demonstrably false but actually laughable. He makes other claims about all sorts of energy sector areas I actually will accuse him of knowingly lying about to push his books and narrative. 


The reason I mention this is that although I do believe the USA will withdraw from such high involvement in the middle East due to less dependence on foreign fossil fuels, he completely misunderstands the trends in energy in the world and therefore can not predict its future.

When you look at the trends in coal production and oil production and consumption, we are seeing a plataue. These sectors are not growing and therefore not drawing as much investment. Combined with increased regulatory pressure from governments all over the world investment in oil and gas might be good for the States, but there is going to be a huge globalised trade in

Nickel, aluminium, steel, cobalt, lithium etc.

And as a free market, the US will also follow this trend as renewables, particularly solar gets cheaper.  International companies are less likely to make investment in a country that is not following global trends. 

It is however not just about direct trade. We see a cheaper way to offset renewable intermittenxy is to build interconnetors. Multiple GW cables that transfer solar power from day areas to night. 

Some examples 
Morocco to UK 
USA to Singapore. 
And a seemingly insane suggestion of South America to China 

Peter doesn't just not appreciate these trends, he actively ignores them due to his misunderstanding of the energy sector. There will still be energy interdependence, both from strategic necessity and economic advantage 

Further, he completely ignores that whenever any nation moves away from globalisation it takes steps to still be 'global' 

Take brexit, it was pinned as an anti globalist movement, yet the UK rushes to sign trade deals all over the world and act within multi lateral frameworks. 

Russia, being driven out of the west, immediately seeks stronger relationships  with a whole host of other nations. 

And then you have the TPP, and even trump signing the NAFTA successor.

[],False,,psyintist,,,[],,,,text,t2_ifr8l,False,False,"The first point is with regard to Zeihan himself.  I have never heard of this guy before two weeks ago, and I see him popping up everywhere of late.  I watched one of his two hour lectures, and I came away both impressed and unimpressed.

I was impressed because he clearly has some data driven elements to his work and he does a great job presenting the data.  The visualizations are impressive and he has a great artistic flair for presentation.  I'm not such a big fan of his delivery and may not necessarily agree with his synthesis of all the pieces he pulls together, I generally agree with most of his baseline assumptions about objective facts.

What did not impress me?  There seems to be a greater-than-zero chance that Mr. Zeihan is not just a bit of a doomsayer and a cartoonish American exceptionalist, as he first appears, but he may actually personify the thesis that Western globalists seek to push the current brand of American global hegemony ad infinitum.  This, naturally, best serves the globalists and particularly the political class and/or those working in the defense and energy sectors.  I think there's a reason to be skeptical of his motivations in this regard.  The lecture I saw him give was to graduate students at one of the US military academies, as an indicator.  He's definitely serving up a certain type of gospel that the national security state types salivate over in their quest to enlarge the bureaucracy, and he relies on their patronage.

One the second point, one sentence you wrote stood out to me:

&gt;Globalization is a complete economic win for the US, and arguably the US benefits more from globalization than some of its partners.

You'll find some folks in the Rust Belt that have seen a generation destroyed by drugs and unemployment due to de-industrialization that may not agree with this assessment.  A lot of them voted for Obama and then turned around and voted for Trump when the promises of Hope and Change went unfulfilled.  Globalization is great for your bills, and even for your job if you're part of the coastal elite and college educated (I say this as a person who belongs to that class, so don't judge); not so much for the rest of folks that make up the voting majority.

More directly, I'd say what you're missing in your analysis is that globalization has hollowed out the soul of the working class in the US.  Globalization has been great for the hypercaptialist class and the WEF types, but it's come at the expense of the great mass of people.  And they're starting to wake up to it, if you couldn't already tell, because figures like Trump or Bernie would have had no political chance 20 years ago before the consequences of globalization became obvious in the US.  And for that reason, I think Zeihan's analysis is largely right on the 'inward-turning' inflection point.  Contrary to him, I hope it happens.  I'd love to see more global multipolarity and more local self sufficiency.  I think his idea that the world will descend into anarchy without the US steady at the helm is some William F. Buckley-flavored nonsense.  And I'd love to see these disgusting and bloated bureaucracies dissembled and put back together in a way that actually makes sense for the public, not just for the gentry-elite that live in the LA/DC/NYC metros.

If Russians would have funded them they yes, I would have. But Islamic extremism as a political tool is US's/Saudi's creation because they funded them without any regard for it's long term consequences tot he region that they were funding. 

In the same vein you can't blame India for still going strong with Russia. India has tolerated West's blunders so it is expected for the west to let India choose it's own allies.

&gt; Anyway, it’s not like the US hasn’t paid a heavy and direct price in both blood and dollars fighting the Taliban.

True. US has paid a heavy price. Why is it that a price is also needs to be paid by to be allies? Why did India suffer if it was only between US and the taliban? Something to think about. 

&gt;I don’t think India can support Russia in a way that will avoid the inevitable, and I don’t think India can bring Russia to the table vs. China. India can absolutely make life painful for Russia, but being unaligned doesn’t enhance that pain.

A lot of western assumptions. You have to wait to see how this plays out. India is not going to make anything painful for Russia. Not in next 20 years at least.

&gt;It seems analogous to the failed German policy of Russian appeasement and the thus far failed French policy of Russian appeasement.

Was Russia providing a UNSC veto for Germany as well? Did US send a nuclear bomb to blow Germany up and did Russia come to the rescue. It is a false analogy. I would suggest coming out of the simpler western analogies. This is the reason this whole situation looks so shocking because people are making analogy with Germany and Russia. 

&gt;Western sphere countries will fall in line, eastern sphere countries will fall in line, and there’s often nobody meaningful but India in the middle. Both sides have fingers in a lot of pies. I don’t think that there’s any benefit to the enhanced credibility of an independent (vs. aligned) India aligning.

Wonder why Germany and France didn't fall in line immediately? These are again assumptions. There will be a lot more choices as we move forward. The difference has been already seen with the recent UNHRC voting pattern. Not everybody is willing to fall in line. And somebody needs to provide that choice. 

&gt;Anyway, your argument about weapons is moot in a world where India and the US are aligned. I know that’s not the world as it exists today, but that’s the point of my post.

No, it's not moot. US has refused tech transfer. It comes up with one aid after another which is supposed to flow back into American military equipment manufacturers. Unless US gives up it's naive rigidity, it is NOT moot. And we are seeing that timelines to be at least 20 years. A lot is going to happen in between.

&gt;I’m also not sure how you jump from fighting a common enemy (the Taliban) to justifying neutrality towards an enemy (Russia). You can argue that the Afghan war didn’t go well for America, and I’d agree, but it’s not like an American victory would have been bad for Indian interests.

This is now the third time I am seeing somebody confused about this. Afghan territory is important for Indian security. The was US dealt with it showed no regard for anybody else's interests. India will need somebody else to balance that out. Russia is still a big deal in Central Asia and afghan bordering countries. India is going to need Russia here. 


&gt;Russia has been jockeying for influence with Western Europe for hundreds of years. Look at     the Crimean war for an example.

Just like any other empire. Last 200 years of western history doesn't really bode well in this argument now does it. Any power needs a sphere of influence. 

&gt; I’m very confident that Russia isn’t going to align with the west in the immediate future. 

Right. That's why it will need somebody who is not west and not china to align with. That is where India comes in. 

&gt; It will, at best, be carved up.

This is the emotional part that I am asking the western populace to control. It is still to be seen what it will be. 

&gt;Similarly, China is too big of a fish to not be a factor. You can argue that the US should avoid alignment and pivot between supporting the weaker of China and India to maintain regional power, and maybe it should

That is for the US to decide. 

&gt;  but India has to fit foreign policy objectives much cleaner. 

No. It is this ambiguity that India is able to talk to Israel and Palestine at the same time, Saudi and Iran at the same time, US and Russia at the same time. India isn't a Russia ally either.

You could just as easily argue that the Taliban is a product of Soviet/Russian aggression. Anyway, it’s not like the US hasn’t paid a heavy and direct price in both blood and dollars fighting the Taliban. 

I don’t think India can support Russia in a way that will avoid the inevitable, and I don’t think India can bring Russia to the table vs. China. India can absolutely make life painful for Russia, but being unaligned doesn’t enhance that pain. 

I’m also not sure what credibility you think India being non-aligned adds in any East vs west dispute. 

Western sphere countries will fall in line, eastern sphere countries will fall in line, and there’s nobody meaningful but India in the middle. I don’t think that there’s any benefit to the enhanced credibility of an independent (vs. aligned) India aligning. 

Anyway, your argument about weapons is moot in a world where India and the US are aligned. I know that’s not the world as it exists today, but that’s the point of my post. 

I’m also not sure how you jump from fighting a common enemy (the Taliban) to justifying neutrality towards an enemy (Russia). You can argue that the Afghan war didn’t go well for America, and I’d agree, but it’s not like an American victory would have been bad for Indian interests. 

Lastly, I’m not sure what you mean vs. emotional vs practical. Russia has been jockeying for influence with Western Europe for hundreds of years. Look at the Crimean war for an example. I’m very confident that Russia isn’t going to align with the west in the immediate future. It will, at best, be carved up. Even then, I’m not holding my breath. Similarly, China is too big of a fish to not be a factor. You can argue that the US should avoid alignment and pivot between supporting the weaker of China and India to maintain regional power, and maybe it should, but India has to fit foreign policy objectives much cleaner.
