While technically speaking - Ukraine administrates a presidential system that is based on elections, the rest of the country is very far from being democratic or free.

At the moment, Ukraine is being heavily backed by western unions. Each of those western unions advocates for freedom, for basic human rights and for democracy. Yet, so far - Ukraine has barely absorbed any criticism. According to the consensus today, Ukraine is free to do anything in its power to eliminate the Russian threat - even if it entails the massacre of thousands of innocents. The International Court of Law or the UN as a whole has barely intervened in anything that's going on in the conflict. 

Ukraine, as a representative of the ""Free World"", should avoid committing war crimes at all costs.

[],False,,West_Ad_905,,,[],,,,text,t2_50oglpm5,False,False,"I have followed this from the beginning. The OP has several good points, with possible inaccuracies which are largely irrelevant. 

After defending the region and city proper, against overwhelming numbers being steadily pushed back but while inflicting high casualties on the attackers, there were 1000-2000 UA soldiers present i the Azovstal plant, with about the same number of civilians sheltering there, the last of three defensive pockets in Mariopal. 

Many civilians were gradually exited by agreement, though this was a long and ridiculous process due to Russian (R) obstruction. Doubtless the Russians wanted the civilians to stay and consume all the defenders‚Äô food and water. The UA commander could have marched them all out under a white flag and dared the R to commit a public war crime by firing on them, but chose not to. We will have to wait for his account to reveal his thinking on this. 

Obviously food and water were an issue but not a decisive one. There were unverified reports of risks being taken to gather collected rainwater on the grounds. People cannot survive without water, and not long without food. These never ran out, but were surely critical by the end. Same for weapons and ammo, available heavier weapons such at AA and AT manpads had surely been expended during the initial citywide defense. Small arms ammo and grenades were likely in short supply approaching critical levels. 

I personally heard no report of resupply by helicopter as stated above, and question how this could have been done with the entire region occupied by Russian forces including AA assets. Any chopper over the factory itself would have been in range of MG and even small arms, to say nothing of heavier weapons. Trying this at night would improve chances only to a small margin. Finally it would have taken a load from many helicopter to make any difference for so many people, and not worth risking the helis. Azovstal was well-stocked. If Heli resupply did occur, it was insignificant. 

Defenders did hold out for 80+ days against severe bombardment (artillery and even heavy bombers) and ground assault. It was a notable feat of arms that will be remembered among the holding actions of modern military history. Many R forces were held in position that could have benefitted R efforts elsewhere. This buying of time was a great benefit to the UA nationwide. The same effect may be playing out now in the East (Sievierodonetsk/Lysychansk pocket, UA element nearly surrounded as of late May 2022, but not taking the plentiful opportunities to withdraw because R encirclement attempt has been ‚Äúslow motion‚Äù at best). This will only be clear when full accounts are available after the  war. We can infer that this delaying effort is sacrificing these UA forces for time to form, supply, train and bring up newly armed UA forces from the west. I don‚Äôt personally agree with sacrificing any significant forces in a far-eastern encirclement if withdrawal to a stable line was possible, but I don‚Äôt know all the facts and Including how large the holding force in the eastern pocket is (reports vary). 

Any stand in service of the greater mission is heroic. Death is likely. Surrender is the best personal outcome, but surrender to the barbaric R is a doubtful prospect. This is why elements of the Azovstal defenders refused national orders to surrender for a few days at the end. The OP is right in his main thrust, that these defenders must be treated fairly, not falsely tried on fabricated ideological charges, and duly exchanged or released after the war ends. Reports of fair treatment are encouraging, but uncertain. It must be watched carefully.

We will only attack targets in Ukraine or position from which are firing into Ukraine or where such positions have rapidly retreated into Russian territory, unless you violate NATO territory then Moscow and St Petersburg are targets and it'll be tit for tat and any ANY force within 1000 miles of US mainland or Hawaii are free game for us.  Stay in Ukraine so will we.   I know that's too dangerous to do but I think they're cowardly and would back down.

All the while you maybe required to stay in the United States.  Currently Russia is prohibiting citizens from traveling to the United States.  So the court would argue that the defendants inability to appear in court is the fault of the Russian government and punitive laws were passed to deter Russian aggression and that the defendants by abiding by Russian law is complacent in that aggression.  It would fall onto the judge to make a ruling.  The judge has to rule within the current law.  Which case, the sanctions and siezures win due to the judicial process requiring constitutional review.
