As a petroleum engineer, many of the things he says about the energy industry track very well with observations I’ve seen over the years. That said, I do think he tends to make very strong statements about specific events happening at specific times and what shapes they will take.

To put it into metaphor, Zeihan is like an expert in plate tectonics who looks at how the plates are shifting and where the pressure points are and says this is likely to be an earthquake zone, and there will be volcanoes there. However he tends to illustrate this by saying an eruption will happen here at such and such a time and the lava will flow this way. I think these specific predictions are most useful for understanding how plate tectonics devolve into lava flows, but not necessarily for deciding when to sell your house and move to the other side of the mountain. So basically, his broad predictions should be used to understand the pressures that are being placed on policy makers and how that shapes their decisions, and his specific predictions should be used as a template for understanding why certain events occur when they do, and why they take the shapes that they do. 

I personally wouldn’t use his predictions to assume what will happen this year or next, but what may happen in the next decade or 2 and what forces would cause it to happen that way.  But, that sounds wishy washy and doesn’t sell books, so he makes string statements of certainty where probabilistic statements of possibility are more appropriate.

I’ve found that in retrospective, his predictions are broadly correct, but wrong in the details.

&gt; May 29 - The &amp;quot;Liberation&amp;quot; of Ukraine&amp;#039;s Donbas region is an &amp;quot;Unconditional priority&amp;quot; for Moscow, while other Ukrainian territories should decide their future on their own, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Sunday.

&gt; Lavrov was speaking in an interview with France&amp;#039;s TF1 television channel as Russia pressed on with its offensive to secure control of key towns in Donbas, Ukraine&amp;#039;s traditional industrial heartland made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

&gt; According to the United Nations, more than 6.7 million refugees have fled Ukraine since Feb. 24.There are some 14,388 cases of Russian alleged war crimes being probed by Ukraine&amp;#039;s Prosecutor General&amp;#039;s Office and several Russian soldiers have pleaded guilty in cases of shelling Ukraine and killing civilians.

Russian bombardment of the facility itself alongside a much tighter perimeter and presumably discovering most if not all of the tunnel exits meant they could only resupply off of dead soldiers that had tried to storm the facility. They were running out of food and medicine especially, but also likely that whatever source of potable water they were using had run out or broken.

There was also an interview about a week before the main surrender where the commander said that the bombardment had destroyed a large freezer room they were using to store the bodies of their fallen comrades. With a bunch of sick and wounded people and no medicine, rotting corpses no matter how deep in the facility would make everyone sick both physically and mentally. They'd already said multiple times that the wounded were basically rotting to death already - any minor wound that gets infected could be a death sentence, any major wounds would just have to be treated as best as possible and then hope they don't die. It's quite likely they overall lost more men to wounds than to actual combat deaths over the 3 months. 

I think too that the sheer amount of them that had survived was a major factor. If they'd been whittled down to only a hundred or so men then it's easier to fight to the death than around 2000 soldiers just sitting there waiting to see if dehydration, illness, hunger or combat kills them first. The sheer number of them left means it's going to be harder for Russia to disappear ALL of them so we'll eventually know what happened and then other countries can start doing things like saying the sanctions will last until all the surrendered soldiers are returned. Can't return some? Well I guess the sanctions stand forever then.",94bc3f6c2634022e91cbc54b1e36d49175d3df71,True,False,,,,,0,1653863896,,0,{},iah8rnn,False,t3_u7w8nf,False,True,t1_iafkygb,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/u7w8nf/ukrainianconflict_megathread_6/iah8rnn/,1653863911,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653835096.0,

The US also has a massive chemical engineering base that processes natural gas into all sorts of crazy shit used in the production of base products. This further lowers the cost of inputs up the manufacturing chain. Think literally turning natural gas into plastics.

543,[],False,,analogspam,,,[],,,,text,t2_11gu6m,False,False,"You can call out for ""WHERE WAS GERMANY WHEN \[insert year Russia was cruel\]?!"" and yes, in a normative way you're totally right. But the world doesn't work like that, I'm sorry to say. If the country which is invaded is far enough away simply no one will care. See Yemen for example. That isn't a german thing, its simply how international relations are handled.

And, if you like it or not, the german-russian diplomatic ties reach back to the Napoleonic Wars and the Auswärtige Amt in Germany was especially designed later by Bismark to concentrate on the old channels and ties of old times. To this day you have a unusual high amount of the old german aristocratic names ""von ..."" in the Diplomatic Corps of Germany. I don't argue that anything of that is good. But Germany is simply in a unique position in Europe. Its not in the west, its not in the east. The GDR didn't suffered under the USSR like Ukraine, Poland, Romania etc. Germany always, since centuries, had to get along with its western and eastern neighbors. In these last decades it introduced its ""peace through trade""-concept which failed and yes, one could totally see the signs with Putin and his new imperialism. But it, as hard as it seems, wasn't, what all the actors in the west wanted to see. Again: None of that is good. It simply is how it is and in the end the reason of every country not to intervene in Chechnya, Georgia and Krim was economic ties and profit. Thats simply how this world works. (That is also the main reason for any eastern european state to join the EU so. Simply because it works.)

For your question regarding the eastern countries. I have no idea. I am in total support of Ukraine, but it simply isn't a NATO member state. That the countries of eastern europe are giving more is of a simple ""nature"": They have more to give than germany. As dumb as it sounds. You have no idea how small the German Combat-Readiness of the Bundeswehr really is. We mutated to a defense system which focused on very small, highly specialized fields.

Regarding the eastern partners: They were aware of the danger of Russia and didn't look the other way / let their military get massively underfunded and (!) have the old soviet tanks / materials, which Ukraine knows how to use. Like the BeNeLux-States, France and Germany supported / worked together with one another much more because of a shared experience the eastern partners do the same. I don't see any unusualness in that.

Germanys Bundeswehr simply can't give much more of its stuff without risking to not even being able to fulfill their NATO obligations. (I don't mean money, I mean the ones of its feasibility of defense.)

  
And another point, which is very important for the populace of many states:  
It seems like you want all armies of the west simply to give Ukraine all their weapon systems and hope for the best but you forget one point: Simply Nobody in the west really knows in what they exactly invest in Ukraine. Only a few years ago it still was one of the most corrupt states in Europe. The trust of many nations, especially in the population of the countries. The polish (read PiS) lies and half-truths against germany in the last years are a good example why there is still cautiousness, because nobody knows if a populist / right wing party will swing the state to a complete other direction.

&amp;#x200B;

Again: I don't try to defend these points or try to say that they are good.  I simply try to give you a greater picture of what the position of many west-european countries is. Its basically between a rock and a hard place (which obviously is still a much more comfy zone than the one of Ukraine).  
I wish only the best for Ukraine and I don't see any satisfactory solution, in which Ukraine doesn't get their whole (read: with Krim) territory back. But this war, the naivety of many countries (especially Germany!) and profit-focused policy simply caused a shit show where there are no winners in any way.",dde8e84672836e5729d680a2c03ff0d7e2395836,True,False,,,,,0,1653858609,,0,{},iagy7jk,False,t3_v0ant5,False,True,t1_iagrttv,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v0ant5/mihkelson_scholz_and_macron_paving_way_for_more/iagy7jk/,1653858624,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653829809.0,

First China has oil reserves of roughly 50 days imports by most estimates. That gives them three months of extreme supply disruption at a minimum, and we are nowhere close to that yet.

Secondly they can lean on the Middle East to supply more, China is their main customer so they will definitely help them out.

Thirdly, he doesn't explain how he gets ""minimum 5million barrels a day""... from his diagrams he just has 1.5million barrel/day going from west Africa to China... he seems to assume that noone takes any cut apart from China, which he doesn't back up.

Forthly, he suggests it CAN just stop going to China, which is false because some are long term contracts.

Fifthly, oil wells can come online within a year or two, and current supply in ME can easily be ramped up.

Sixthly, of course they can get more oil from Russia if they need to, but it probably won't come to that.

&gt;“There is an informal NATO agreement not to send certain Western weapons” =/= “Germany has an agreement with certain NATO members not to send certain Western weapons”.

Aaaannnndddd Germany is part of NATO, this agreement was reported by German newspapers after it was confirmed by SDP representative and Germany has thus far NOT supplied western weapons. France has, US has, UK has etc etc. This ""informal"" agreement seems to only be applying to Germany so far.

It's called critical thinking and analysis. Must be nice to either be incapable of doing so or simply refusing to do so.

&gt;Would it?  
&gt;  
&gt;Yeah, obviously.

How? I have already pointed out the flaw in that assumption. This is the crux of the problem with trying to discuss anything with you, I make a point and you reply with a single line with no proof or explanation. Explain to me how, given the deficiencies and problems that you and others have pointed out with the German army, them not having an army would make any appreciable difference to the Eastern flank of NATO? 

&gt;I think it is fairly obvious by the reaction that they were not kept in the Loop. Zelensky and others have been baffled by the decision of Scholz and Macron to call Putin, which would be odd if they had been in the loop. But I know that you will dismiss this because there isn't something written in Black and White saying as much.  
&gt;  
&gt;So another one of your inventions.

Nope

&gt;It is on Macron and Scholz for enabling Putin....he WANTS to feel like the center of the universe and like he is having an impact on the West.  
&gt;  
&gt;To enable him to do what exactly? Feel slightly better about himself?

Yes, exactly. Power mad dictators want to feel important. Continually calling him and begging him to stop does just this. As I said before, it's why people don't continually call Kim Jong Un or Ali Khamenei....As soon as you give people like that the spotlight it encourages them to keep acting out because they are getting attention like they want.

- Russian oil extraction has relied heavily on Western expertise, which is now gone, suggesting major technical difficulties for future Russian supply.
- The US is likely to stop exporting oil by the end of the Summer.
- Europe will be competing with China for oil from West Africa, due to the loss of American and Russian oil.
- Thus China is going to bear the majority of the shortfall in oil supply. They will lose at least 5M barrels a day, a 30% drop.
- This will lead to a catastrophic slowdown in Chinese industry.
- Xi has created an intense cult of personality, resulting in administration of the PRC primarily by people incapable of independent thought, and reluctant to supply Xi with the information he'd need for effective administration.
- PRC zero-COVID policy is paralyzing Chinese industry, and they can't afford politically to buy effective vaccines from the West.
- Massive divestment of manufacturing capital from China as a result.
- Impending food shortage due to massive churn in Chinese pork farming after the recent African swine fever culling, leading to unskillful farming and low yields.
- Rice is very phosphate- and fertilizer-intensive, and RF/Ukraine are major suppliers of both, so rice yields are likely to be low.",add99297b45c360d906358f4f9752bb3d0a3f4bd,True,False,,,,,0,1653857267,,0,{},iagvgjs,True,t3_v0jblv,False,True,t1_iagsrtx,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v0jblv/energy_at_the_end_of_the_world_zeihans/iagvgjs/,1653857282,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653828467.0,

I suggest blaming the regime, not the people or the regions. Propaganda based on old collective trauma and resentiment is an incredibly strong stuff. I remember hoping Saddam to win in the Gulf War because I disliked the US back then (and I was 11 at that time), and I've started to understand what's going on only after Georgia. But that's just my mindset, and most of the people just love to consume the most comforting information.
Russia, along with pretty much everyone, didn't have any real borders in 1300. And I find this idea of separating Russia into lots of states kinda stupid. I can see Caucasus regions leaving for sure, but most of the country is vastly interconnected (especially because most of the regions need dotations) and people overall consider themselves Russian. So it won't be a voluntary separation if it happens, and that leads only to another disaster.

Correct me if I'm wrong but haven't we given them insanely more than any other country and yet people are still bitching?

There are also Turks killed by Kurdish Fighters with German weapons. If the initial Export was not illegal there is nothing wrong with Exports.

725,[],False,,phyxor,,,[],,,,text,t2_eljtmwg,False,False,"&gt;What do you mean by ""Germany went all in in the beginning""? Germany doesn't have any big numbers of heavy weapons lying around. 

This line of reasoning is very unconvincing after the 5000 helmets debacle from the beginning of the war. Somehow, later, some AT weapons were found, then some Gepards, then there are news of Rheinmetal waiting for approval by the gov't to sell tanks etcetc.  
Where were all of these things on Feb 23? Where were they on Feb 24? Where were they on Feb 25? Where are they now? Where are the Gepards?  


And what is the Bundeswehr defending Germany from? France? Denmark? A Bayern breakoff? The Bundeswehr can wait to rearm if they lack weapons now, the Ukrainians can not. 

And what's the French excuse with this one? They have plenty of weapons.

The tiniest of Eastern European countries are sending everything they have, and then there is the elite of Europe saying shit like ""we better not humiliate Putin"" or ""can violence really fight violence?""  


I don't want to sow division either, but the Germans can not get away with this complacency and have to be punished for it (in a social sense), or else they will be sitting in their kumbaya-delusion circle until Berlin is within shelling range.  But maybe that's the plan? Because the signs seem to point that way. Too many things have gone wrong.

Here's what makes the naivete seem like pretense: Where were the Germans in 1999? How about in 2008? What about 2014? Who in their right mind even thinks that ""well, we had a minor Anschluss with South Ossetia/Crimea, but it's OK, we'll just build Nordstream 1/2 anyway""? At one point the supposed naivete stops seeming accidental.  
""Oh no, we don't have weapons to fight Russia! Verdammt...""  
""Oh no, we became dependent on Russian energy...""  
""Oh no, we don't have consent to give ammo for the weapons we have...""  
""Oh no, we had another fruitless call with Hitler 2.0 who now knows he is still well esteemed enough to talk to....""  


And the French selling weapons systems to Russia post 2014? What is up with that?  


The Germans either continued to be naive even after their allies scream at them to get their shit together for 2 decades or they are just playing dumb. They either think their allies to be idiots or they are actively working against them behind the scenes - entangling themselves so that when shit hits the fan they can shrug and say ""well, we would like to help you, but you see, we can't"" while the Poles and Balts are next on the chopping block. Which is it? Dumb or evil?

Or maybe it's just moral grandstanding? ""Oh we can't do war after WW2, that's so uncivilized."" Easy position to take when nobody wants to invade you.... yet. I'd file this under dumb.  


I don't even know what the French might be thinking. They might just be far enough to genuinely not give a shit, really, and might just be sad that Russian oligarchs won't be buying Louis Voutton as much.  


I understand the fear of the far right, but let's be fair, if the alternatives are what Russia is doing and some sort of illiberal anti immigration and catholic bollocks - at least they won't be sending you to fucking Siberia. But maybe that historical experience doesn't say much to you, maybe the worst you really can imagine is a ban on abortion and some mildly racist policies on immigration? Russia can't be THAT bad, can it - is that what you're thinking?

Bucha is the rule, not an exception. 

So tell me, who do we, Eastern Europeans, get to rely on for support? Who can we trust to be on OUR side? Not on some abstract ""we want everyone to be friends"" sort of bullshit side, but OUR side? We've been screaming for three decades and if **THIS** isn't enough for the Germans to start taking the Russia problem seriously - war seriously - then we can only pray that the US doesn't get distracted by China and won't abandon us this time, like after WW2.   


I hope this thing just fizzles out and that all that economic output Germany is saving for themselves will help us rebuild. But if Russia wins, it's over. We might as well all move to the US if we want to live. Then it gets to be Germany's turn to share a border with Russia.",5445448e0229aacfbb8348f942aa0ceb5464d7f9,True,False,,,,,0,1653855498,,0,{},iagrttv,False,t3_v0ant5,False,True,t1_iaggkjk,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v0ant5/mihkelson_scholz_and_macron_paving_way_for_more/iagrttv/,1653855510,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653826698.0,

“There is an informal NATO agreement not to send certain Western weapons” =/= “Germany has an agreement with certain NATO members not to send certain Western weapons”.

As I said, your own malicious invention. Glad you admitted it. 

&gt; Would it? 

Yeah, obviously. 

&gt; I think it is fairly obvious by the reaction that they were not kept in the Loop. Zelensky and others have been baffled by the decision of Scholz and Macron to call Putin, which would be odd if they had been in the loop. But I know that you will dismiss this because there isn't something written in Black and White saying as much.

So another one of your inventions. 

&gt; It is on Macron and Scholz for enabling Putin....he WANTS to feel like the center of the universe and like he is having an impact on the West.

To enable him to do what exactly? Feel slightly better about himself?

It also seems that NATO may not be what we think it is. Its supposed to be North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Based on democratic values. The values part is more important than many think it is. We hear a lot about the article 5 (which to be honest has never been truly tested). Article 5 is just ink on the paper if you do not share the common values of democracy and freedom. It the common values that get the motivation to pick up weapons and fight, to kill or to be killed. Without the motivation and shared values, its just trading and evading responsibilities.

Finland and Sweden did really extensive background check with every NATO country about the opinions of joining. Everyone said they had nothing against joining.

When the official application was sent, this shit show started. It seems that we are not joining defense organization with shared democratic values but to some bizarre bazaar trading organization that seems to be led by this borderline dictator from Turkey. I wonder who is next in the line for trading.

&gt;Neither is there any “fixation”, nor a shift of focus. Read the discussion again, as slowly as you need to. You’ll figure it out eventually.

You keep changing your focus. First it was small arms, then overall aid, then you got obsessed with tanks and now AA systems. I get that you are trying to find something that will stick but this is not it. I suggest you take your own advice really.

&gt;Says the guy making various claims without any shred of evidence.  
&gt;  
&gt;Feel free to request evidence whenever you need it.  
&gt;  
&gt;But here you go. German Industry is utterly reliant on Russia: https://news.sky.com/story/germany-fears-recession-if-heavy-reliance-on-russian-gas-is-reduced-too-quickly-12601003  
&gt;  
&gt;That’s the “gas can’t be phased out quickly” argument. It’s well known, I have made it a few times myself. Nothing spectacularly new there, nothing to support “cosy up to Russia to the exclusion of other EU nations” though.

It's the ""Germany is overly reliant on Russia and now cannot uncouple

&gt;No it's not, that is what is in the news and in various articles.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is.

Go on then, show me.....

&gt;Again, nope. That is literally the tweet posted by an official German Parliament twitter....Again, just because you don't like it doesn't make it wrong  
&gt;  
&gt;Feel free to link me the tweet where Scholz said Ukraine should allow their genocide? I suspect that part is your own malicious invention.

By definition Scholz's position that Ukraine should make concessions and that ""violence should be met with peace"" implies that he is okay with the Genocide taking place in Ukraine. However I never said that's what he said, I interpreted his meaning based on his actions and statements. I understand that might be hard for you to comprehend given how you have struggled so far in this discussion. 

&gt;And yet they have the second largest arms industry in Europe. I know the German army is a farce and that they can barely equip their own rapid reaction brigade, but given Scholz is apparently all about pacifism why not just give it all away?  
&gt;  
&gt;Good question. I wouldn’t mind, but that would be a radical move, and mean the end of the NATO contingents on the eastern flank.

Would it? Germany is basically unable to equip the 5000 men it commits to NATO as it is. If you and others are to be believed the German military is a shambles of unusable equipment anyway so where would the loss be? Other Eastern NATO countries are stepping up as they now see what is happening and how they in fact CANNOT rely on the likes of Germany for assistance.

&gt;There is when you are initiating diplomacy on behalf of a country without being asked and without giving them the courtesy of letting them know.  
&gt;  
&gt;Do we know the Ukrainians were out of the loop?

I think it is fairly obvious by the reaction that they were not kept in the Loop. Zelensky and others have been baffled by the decision of Scholz and Macron to call Putin, which would be odd if they had been in the loop. But I know that you will dismiss this because there isn't something written in Black and White saying as much.

&gt;Also, when the discussion includes blatant lies by the aggressor it puts into question the validity of the call.  
&gt;  
&gt;Why? Because Putin is dishonest? That’s on Putin, not on Macron and Scholz.

It is on Macron and Scholz for enabling Putin....he WANTS to feel like the center of the universe and like he is having an impact on the West. Calling him up and giving him a platform to propogate his lies just enables him more. The South Koreans don't go ringing up North Korea everytime they fire a missile because they know it would encourage more of the same due to it getting a reaction.  


Here is yet more proof of the frustrations within the Eastern members of the EU. Frustrations which you so vehemently denied existing a few comments ago:  


&gt;Orthography isn't just about spelling. It also includes grammar as that is a key aspect of the spoken language which is being represented in text.  
&gt;  
&gt;Your orthography was wrong, i.e. the spelling, not your grammar.

For once just read and understand what is written. Orthography isn't just spelling, it is the whole act of transcribing spoken language. By definition that includes things like Grammar. If you want to say my mobile phone spelling is crap, just say my spelling is crap instead of trying to sound clever and misusing Orthography.

&gt;That might be so, but those 600,000 barrels equate to 8% of US oil a year (a country of 360million people btw) compared to almost 30% of German imports.  
&gt;  
&gt;Russia is paid by the barrel, not by barrel per capita or share of imports.

I know, the point is that the USA has stopped the Russian oil imports because it was a tiny percentage.

it was said that the fighting was fierce, that the Russians were throwing EVERYTHING and that they were taking heavy casualties.

if they have reached the center of the city it means 3 things:

1) the Ukrainians surrendered en masse (it would be strange since the city was not even surrounded and there are escape routes).

2) the Ukrainians withdrew from Severodonetsk.

3) the Russians launched such a heavy attack that they destroyed the Ukrainians.

*****
&gt; Ukraine&amp;#039;s military intelligence chief, Major General Kyrylo Budanov, in a mid-May interview with Sky News claimed without evidence that Putin has cancer and said that a coup to supplant the Russian leader was in motion.

&gt; Reporting from the Russian outlet Proekt has turned up evidence that Putin has chronic back problems, that he has repeatedly disappeared from public view for several days, and that he has at times traveled with an extensive medical team.

&gt; &amp;quot;I can find no evidence that I can tell of parkinsonism in Putin,&amp;quot; Ray Chadhuri, a neurologist at the University of London, told DW in April after viewing a video clip of Putin with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu that was at the center of the Parkinson&amp;#039;s speculation.

In the past three days, hundreds of ordinary Lithuanians crowdfunded €5mn to buy a Turkish military drone for Ukraine, according to the internet broadcaster Laisves TV, which started the fundraising.

Mihkelson, invoking a phrase that Macron previously used to describe Nato, asked if the French and German leaders were not “being brain-dead” in their actions.

He added: “Macron and Scholz should hang up the phone and book a trip to Ukraine post haste. I hope their peculiar actions are not motivated by fear of losing influence in democratic Europe which Ukraine would surely enter after winning the war.”

Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania’s foreign minister, said on Sunday that Russia “must be isolated” as countries around the world including India, Australia, Japan, South Korea and “little Taiwan” were watching what happened in Ukraine with anxiety. “Giving the occupier a chance to occupy territory means that it can be repeated elsewhere,” he added.

Putin, Scholz and Macron discussed whether a negotiated solution could be found to open Odesa to allow grain exports to leave Ukraine, according to an Elysée briefing after the call.

The French and German leaders “noted the Russian president’s promise to allow ships to access the port to export grain without it being used militarily by Russia — if the port was demined in advance”, according to the briefing.

Some western capitals fear the looming food crisis and its devastating impact on poor households in Africa and the Middle East could trigger a new wave of migration to Europe.

Kristi Raik, head of the Estonian Foreign Policy Institute, said that the French and German leaders risked giving legitimacy to “Putin’s lies and unacceptable demands”. 

She added: “I don’t share the view that no Western leader should ever talk to Putin. But the way Macron and Scholz are doing it is not just unhelpful, it is deeply counterproductive.”",0df49951872587d5a58167978d365e5c5d1cb921,True,False,,,,,0,1653850319,,0,{},iaggteh,True,t3_v0hnoe,False,True,t1_iaggmd2,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v0hnoe/baltics_attack_francogerman_talks_with_putin_over/iaggteh/,1653850334,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653821519.0,

**Diplomatic initiatives by Paris and Berlin seen as ‘paving way for more violence’ as rift grows over best approach to end war in Ukraine**

Baltic politicians have lashed out at French and German leaders for discussing with Russian president Vladimir Putin how to unblock Ukrainian ports, highlighting the diverging views among western allies over how to handle diplomacy with Moscow.

Leaders in eastern Europe have grown uneasy about the willingness of their western European counterparts to talk with Putin, reigniting suspicion that some EU countries are pushing Kyiv to cede territory to end the war.

“It is incredible how the leaders of France and Germany are inadvertently paving the way for new acts of violence by Russia . . . How is it possible neither Paris nor Berlin have learned from history? Why is it presumed that Putin, currently waging a war on a major European people, intends to keep any promise?” asked Marko Mihkelson, head of the Estonian parliament’s foreign affairs committee.

Artis Pabriks, Latvia’s deputy prime minister, said on Twitter: “It seems that there are number of so-called Western leaders who possess explicit need for self-humiliation in combination with total detachment from political reality.”

German chancellor Olaf Scholz and French president Emmanuel Macron held a 80-minute phone call with Putin on Saturday in which the Russian president told them Moscow was willing to find ways to unblock grain exports from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports and could increase its own fertiliser and agriculture exports if relevant sanctions are lifted.

It came two days after Italian prime minister Mario Draghi also discussed the issue with Putin in an attempt to ease a global food crisis that threatens developing countries in particular.

There is a growing rift between many eastern European countries and the likes of Germany and France over the wisdom of speaking to Putin as the war enters into its fourth month. The Baltic countries believe such phone calls merely empower Putin, and that instead Europe should send more weapons to Ukraine.",26283543561549b48ef13a01c1fed0e4f4187c8e,True,False,,,,,0,1653850227,,0,{},iaggmd2,True,t3_v0hnoe,False,True,t3_v0hnoe,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v0hnoe/baltics_attack_francogerman_talks_with_putin_over/iaggmd2/,1653850242,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653821427.0,

What do you mean by ""Germany went all in in the beginning""? Germany doesn't have any big numbers of heavy weapons lying around. Our military is extremely underfunded and the population has massive problems with sending weapons of any kind. I really don't understand what reddit has in mind when it thinks of Germany.. still the Wehrmacht with Panzerschokolade-feeded Supersoldaten and horizons of the latest weapon systems? Nothing of that is reality. Even if by some miracle ukrainian soldiers were trained on Pzh 2000 from day 1 of the Invasion these systems wouldn't bring a victory in a week. Germany basically send anything what the Bundeswehr didn't need itself and could be supplied by enough ammunition.  
This Wikipedia-Table is a meme now, sure, but still Germany is one of the biggest supporters of Ukraine in total Numbers, but we are not, by any means (!), a military superpower or something. Yes, Germany is one of the biggest sellers of weapons in the world, but these are to garage-sales. When you order these you have YEARS of waiting for these systems. Even our Bundeswehr doesn't have the current systems in sufficient numbers (working numbers is another story...).  
What Germany is is an economical Power. But still extremely dependent on supplies of natural resources. And Germany cancelled one of its biggest economical undertaking basically in an instant after the invasion (NS 2) and understood, that its ""peace through trade""-concept was indeed naive and short-sighted. All these people crying for a stop of the gas supply from Russia has a point, that its paying for the invasion, but paralyze the German, and in the end the european economy wouldn’t do anyone any good. Mass layoffs etc. would be the result and most likely in a massive rise of the far right (which is extremely pro-Russian).  
   
I’m deeply concerned about the rise of odium against Germany and France in the last weeks in this subreddit. Articles by “Die WELT” for example or other tabloid-like media, where most of the text is presumptive and no facts. Also so fact that Macron and Schulz still call with Putin. OF FUCKING COURSE THEY DO. That is how diplomacy works. And even if there is only a 0.0000000000000012% Chance of success in diplomatic ways you have to try it. As unrealistic as it seems. The more isolated Putin is the more dangerous he will become in the end. He won’t simply stop because he accepts the fact that the invasion is a bad idea.  
It seems like there is a campaign a la “Eastern Europe doesn’t need France / Germany / the EU etc.” which would ultimately help Putin directly in the end again.  
   
TL;DR: It seems your imaginations of Germany and France are the Problem and your assessment of their possibilities.

I'm sorry that Germany doesn't meet your expectations, sure. But these expectations seemed to consist of a Wehrmacht-style military with a massive amount of weapons and an economic powerhouse which is inert to outer influences.",f69b1d0510950b5864be172afe90f48f04d2c97e,True,False,,,,,0,1653850204,,0,{},iaggkjk,False,t3_v0ant5,False,True,t1_iag73at,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v0ant5/mihkelson_scholz_and_macron_paving_way_for_more/iaggkjk/,1653850218,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653821404.0,

After the First Chechen War

The T-80 performed so poorly in the First Chechen War that General-Lieutenant Aleksandr Galkin, the head of the Armour Directorate, convinced the Minister of Defence after the conflict to never again procure tanks with gas turbine engines[40] (Galkin reversed his position in 1996, claiming that the T-80U was superior to the T-90).[26] After that, T-80 MBTs were never again used to capture cities, and, instead, they supported infantry squads from a safe distance. Defenders of the T-80 point out that the T-72 performed just as badly in urban fighting in Grozny as the T-80 and that there were two mitigating factors: after the breakup of the Soviet Union, poor funding meant no training for new Russian tank crews, and the tank force entering the city had no infantry support.[33]

Russia has not used the tanks in later conflicts such as the 1999 Second Chechen War, the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, or the 2014 Russo-Ukrainian War.",905c8834bf1b1a6bf7fdb37b9acac3e7dae387ec,True,False,,,,,0,1653849813,,0,{},iagfqg6,False,t3_v0gb8t,False,True,t3_v0gb8t,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v0gb8t/russian_train_loaded_with_t80_tanks_on_the_move/iagfqg6/,1653849831,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653821013.0,

 I must now say, that I was wrong in my assessment.
While my points were not incorrect, the factor Scholz does play a big part in the lack of military aid, slow sanctions etc.

 Just today a report came out, that Germany hasn't delivered weapons since March 28th. That's 2 months ago.

Interestingly enough, the Green Party (coalition partner in the german government) has done more to help end Germany's dependence on russian energy and to end get weapons to Ukraine, than the SPD (senior coalition partner). It's also Vice Chancellor Habeck (Green party) and foreign minister Baerbock (Green party) who are doing most of the work to achieve this. Unfortunately they are getting blocked by the SPD and Scholz.
Also, while Baerbock has been to Ukraine, Scholz has been acting like a petulant child.

 Now my question is, if my government is not capable of delivering weapons, how can I donate to allow the purchase of weapons or at least ammunition?",1a269f3d64ab7237ba6afd82d71fa0a40d1cfc24,True,False,,,,,0,1653849743,,0,{},iagfkzu,False,t3_v0ant5,False,True,t3_v0ant5,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v0ant5/mihkelson_scholz_and_macron_paving_way_for_more/iagfkzu/,1653849756,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653820943.0,

Another scenario could be that Russian economy starts tanking REAL hard (especially maybe since soon oil exports seem to break away), leading to a huge depression which spirals down Venezuela style. People around him could see this coming, and wait for the people to realize that everything is fucked up, which is the moment they will jump in, and use Putin as scapegoat.

Oh for sure.  For example, as soon as it was obvious that the Donbass campaign of 2014-15 wasn't going to work, Russia should have escalated immediately or pulled the plug.  Instead they allowed the conflict to simmer for just long enough that Ukraine could reform their military, cycle multiple classes of recruits through an actual combat zone, for the west to make contingency plans etc etc.  

Michael Kofmann touched on this in the latest War on the Rocks podcast - the longer Russia kicks the mobilization can down the road, the harder it's going to become to actually mobilize effectively.  Career soldiers that are supposed to supervise the intake and actually train these new recruits are being wasted at the front right now, and raw conscripts in combat *can* work...if they have enough professionals around them to stiffen their spine and teach them on the job.

KYIV/KHARKIV, Ukraine, May 29 (Reuters) - Ukrainian forces endured heavy artillery barrages on Sunday as they held off Russian attempts to capture Sievierodonetsk, the largest city Kyiv still controls in the Luhansk region of the Donbas, Ukrainian officials said.

The shelling was so intense it was not possible to assess casualties and damage, Luhansk governor Serhiy Gaidai said. Dozens of buildings have been destroyed in the past few days.

""The situation has extremely escalated,"" Gaidai said.

The Ukrainian government meanwhile urged the West to provide it with more longer-range weapons in order to turn the tide in the war, now in its fourth month.

The battle for Sievierodonetsk, which lies on the eastern bank of the Siverskyi Donets River, is in the spotlight as Russia ekes out slow but solid gains in the Donbas, comprising of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.

Having failed to take the capital Kyiv in the early phase of the war, Russia is seeking to consolidate its grip on the Donbas, large parts of which are already controlled by Moscow-backed separatists.

It has concentrated huge firepower on a small area - a contrast to earlier phases of the conflict when its forces were often spread thinly - bludgeoning towns and cities with artillery and air strikes.

Governor Gaidai said on Sunday that Russian forces had dug in at the Myr hotel on Sievierodonetsk's northern edge.

""They cannot advance further into the city and are taking casualties, but we are not able right now to push them out of the hotel,"" he said on Telegram.

Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War in Washington said the Russians had still not managed to encircle the city and the Ukrainian defenders have inflicted ""fearful casualties"" on them.

The Ukrainians were taking serious losses themselves, civilians as well as combatants, they said in a briefing paper.

Russia's focus on Sievierodonetsk had drawn resources from other battlefronts and as result they had made little progress elsewhere, the analysts said.

A Reuters journalist in the area said a ceramics factory was almost completely destroyed on the outskirts of the Donetsk town of Bakhmut, which straddles the last main road into Sievierodonetsk and is just 10 km (6 miles) from the frontline.

The journalist heard what appeared to be outgoing artillery fire and Russian aircraft dropping a bomb close to the town. The city itself was not badly damaged and while the town was relatively empty, some residents were walking with pets and children.

Several transporters with Ukrainian soldiers could be seen in the area.
SEND GUNS

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy - who has won widespread admiration in the West for his leadership in the conflict - visited Ukrainian troops on the frontlines in northeastern Kharkiv region on Sunday.

Several explosions were heard in Kharkiv city hours after the visit, his first trip outside the Kyiv region since the Feb. 24 start of the Russian invasion, a Reuters journalist said.

A large plume of smoke could be seen rising northeast of the centre of the city, which has been the target of Russian shelling in recent days after several weeks of relative quiet. read more

""You risk your lives for us all and for our country,"" the president's office quoted him as telling soldiers as he handed out commendations and gifts.

Earlier, Zelenskiy voiced hopes Ukraine's allies would provide much-needed weapons and said he expected ""good news"" in the coming days.

Ukraine has started receiving Harpoon anti-ship missiles from Denmark and U.S. self-propelled howitzers, his defence minister said on Saturday. read more

Presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak repeated a call for U.S.-made long-range multiple-rocket launchers. U.S. officials have told Reuters such systems are actively being considered, with a decision possible in coming days.

Zelenskiy said in a television interview on Saturday he believed Russia would agree to talks if Ukraine could recapture all the territory it has lost since the invasion.

But he ruled out the idea of using force to win back all the land Ukraine has lost to Russia since 2014, which includes the southern peninsula of Crimea, annexed by Moscow that year.

""I do not believe that we can restore all of our territory by military means. If we decide to go that way, we will lose hundreds of thousands of people,"" he said.

Russia says it is waging a ""special military operation"" to demilitarize Ukraine and rid it of nationalists threatening Russian-speakers there. Ukraine and Western countries say Russia's claims are a false pretext for a war of aggression.

Thousands of people, including many civilians, have been killed and several million have fled their homes, either to safer parts of Ukraine or abroad.
COUNTER-ATTACKS

Elsewhere, Ukraine's military command said its forces were counter-attacking in the southern Kherson region, most of which is occupied by Russia.

It said in its daily briefing they had pushed back Russian troops and forced them to take defensive positions near the Pivdennyi Buh River after a similar counter-attack the previous day in three villages on the border with the neighbouring Mykolaiv region.

Mykolaiv's regional administration said residential areas of Mykolaiv city had been shelled on Sunday morning, killing one civilian and wounding at least six.

Salient points:

* it is now entirely produced in Poland
* the gun design was licensed from the British and is manufactured in Poland
* the chassis is licensed from Korea with the first 18 built in Korea (K9 Thunder chassis) and the balance built in Poland
* original plan was to build 122 in total at a rate of 16 per yr and at least 80 delivered so far
* fires standard NATO 155MM ammo all types with 30km-40km range using typical types of 155 ammo
* has a sustained fire rate of 6 rounds per minute
* there is no mention as to whether it has Multiple Rounds Simultaneous Impact (MRSI) capability.

I suspect with current war evidence of the importance of self propelled artillery we might see the production continue beyond the planned order.

If Germany went all in in the beginning, the timeline would be around the end of summer. If Germany pulls its head out its ass now, maybe the end of the year.

At this rate, this war might just not end at all, because if russia wins, they are not going to get the message that they can't win a war in Europe and are going start gathering strength again to get revenge on anyone that helped the Ukrainians... meaning, new war in Europe.

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Sure, the continuing battering of the russian forces is cool and all but wouldnt it be better if all this just stops and the russians fuck off and dont occupy a single milimeter of ukraine anymore?

That's exactly the problem - you don't understand the Russians. They will not take their hands off the stove unless they get burnt. They will not just go home and say something along the lines of ""oh well, we tried."" This is what Mihkelson means when he askes whether Paris and Berlin learnt nothing from history - Hitler did not stop when he got the Sudetenland, he did not stop at Poland, he did not stop with the Anschluss and he did not stop in Paris either. They will not stop until their armies are burnt to a crisp and their society either collapses under its own weight or that of an invader. 

They are not like us, they do not work for a good life for their people. Their aims are as fantastical as those of the nazis - some sort of abstract glory, not tangible things - they find those to be idols of degeneracy. They think you are prostitutes for willing to put aside national glory for consumer goods and would be happy to die in a war just so others would fear them. The only way to stop them is to make them unable to wage war. If they go home, they will come back later.

Politics often seems a hopeless house of mirrors, a morass of lies reflecting hatred:

“All issues are political issues, and politics itself is a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred and schizophrenia.”

George Orwell, All Art Is Propaganda: Critical Essays

But let us hope in the power of education:

“If you hate violence and don’t believe in politics, the only major remedy remaining is education. Perhaps society is past praying for, but there is always hope for the individual human being, if you can catch him young enough. This belief partly accounts for Dickens’s preoccupation with childhood.”

If Russia *does* blow it, they're flooding and essentially blowing all crossings downstream, cutting Kherson off from Russian supply lines and retreat. They cannot blow that crossing without de facto ceding Kherson. It makes the battle for that dam, that crossing, basically the hinge upon which the entire battle for Kherson rests. If Russia can hold it they can hold Kherson. If they cannot hold it, Ukraine can take it back. If they don't blow it, they'll be forced either into a siege or to pull back. If they blow it they'll be stranding their forces west of the Dnieper. It's a real pickle for Russia and their only hope in Kherson is to hold that crossing.

&gt; I can't agree with this statement. I think that it's a completely different thing because unlike internationalization which considers multiple national identities within a single idea, it wipes all the identities to make them similar to one.  
  
The very point was that the prior identities won't be completely wiped out. And even if it were, that would be a result of a process which would take a lot of time (many centuries, usually about 1000 years, give or take 2x) - during which there would be multiple social identities. For example, there are still native meryans living at and around Moscow. Interaction between multiple societies and nations IS internationalism. And in case of an empire it is at least partly forced.  
  
&gt;&gt; because a nation can only emerge via a bottom-up process.  
  
&gt; Not sure about this, but it may be. There are several examples of (failed or semi-failed) artificially created nations: Soviet people - failed, North Koreans - mostly successful top-down artificial nation.  
  
North Koreans are not entirely artificially created. Korea has through the past 3000 years been divided into 2-3 parts.

A slow retreat, forcing the enemy to move forward into presighted artillery range is brutal but effective. Pull back and make it seem like a retreat, let the assaulting forces enter the kill zone, and turn back around when the advancing enemy has been bled out. Can't do it too often unless the guys retaking the field of contact are from reserves, it takes a lot of energy to do maneuvers like that. Depends on how smart the advancing commander is, too.

Troop rotation is tricky, properly using it means that there's not as many people on the front line, but those people are refreshed, have higher energy, and fight better.

I can't agree with this statement. I think that it's a completely different thing because unlike internationalization which considers multiple national identities within a single idea, it wipes all the identities to make them similar to one.

&gt; You are describing a top-down process

Yes. 

&gt; because a nation can only emerge via a bottom-up process.

Not sure about this, but it may be. There are several examples of (failed or semi-failed) artificially created nations: Soviet people - failed, North Koreans - mostly successful top-down artificial nation.

The supply of better weapons this week at least tell us that the allies feel the same way. The dog and pony show with Putin to to appease the appeasers to appear like they would sue for peace. 

Seeing Sarkozy all cozy with Victor O shows us that there are lots of Russia adjacent people in power throughout europe so any appeasement will undoubtedly tilt towards Russia so Ukraine should give them nothing other than the bodies of their dead. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only concession I would give is full nuclear disarmament for sanctions removal as they have shown themselves to be unreliable. They wont do it obviously so the sanctions would stick.

Many HDP mayors have been removed from their elected positions and replaced by pro-government officials, and jail sentences have been upheld for their MPs.

&gt; President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine made a working visit to Kharkiv Oblast where he visited the Ukrainian troops at the frontline, inspected destroyed infrastructure, and convened a meeting.

&gt; While there, the president convened a working meeting regarding the situation in Kharkiv Oblast and the city of Kharkiv.

&gt; Head of Kharkiv Oblast Military Administration informed Zelenskyy that 31% of Kharkiv Oblast currently remains under Russian occupation; 5% of its territory has been liberated from the Russian occupiers.

However, I think it’s still fair to acknowledge that the distinction is quite a pedantic one. Although there has always been a difference between the historical state of Kievan Rus’ and the Duchy (later the Tsardom) of Moscow, the word “Rus” was used to refer to both for a very long time.

The word “Россия” was calqued directly from the Byzantine Greek word for “Rus” (Ρωσία), and people in what is now Russia thought of themselves as “the Rus” well into the 18th century. Beginning in the 15th century and continuing throughout most of the rest of the second millennium, “Русь” and “Русская земля” were understood by many to be synonyms. It is in this context that the word “Belarus” originated. 

This of course is a large simplification; but the fact remains that distinguishing “Rus” from “Russia”, and by extension “Belarus” from “Belorussia”, is a practice that only arose in the last century or so. And as one can see in the case of the latter, the distinction has still not yet fully taken hold in a number of European languages.",3b4c185bf0a04c261834d4a59134f3161487eb79,True,False,,,,,0,1653836465,,0,{},iafm9ci,False,t3_v07o6c,False,True,t3_v07o6c,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v07o6c/norway_changes_the_name_of_white_russia_to/iafm9ci/,1653836477,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653807665.0,

&gt; Asked the question, &amp;quot;Why is Russia conducting this war in this way, committing war crimes?&amp;quot; Mr Kelin replied: &amp;quot;The mayor of Bucha in his initial statement has confirmed that Russian troops has left, everything is clean and calm, the town in a normal state.&amp;quot;Nothing is happening, no bodies are on the street.

&gt; What we heard from Russia&amp;#039;s UK ambassador Andrei Kelin is what we&amp;#039;ve been hearing for years from Russian officials whenever their county is accused of anything.

&gt; In other words, none of this is ever Russia&amp;#039;s fault, everyone is against Russia, everyone is blaming Russia, everyone is accusing Russia and it claims it is the innocent party.

The west is sending lots of mostly mothballed equipment, and one of the reasons is that under no circumstances, any modern weapon should be captured and put in China's hands.Yes, yes, it's because ukrainians need training and all that. Ok.  
Equipment are things. If Ukraine (hopefully!) wins this war tomorrow, if all the involvement has been ""things"", it's just time to celebrate.  
For countries that have received ""people"", still many moral, social and economic problems are ahead, as you said.

Democracy is a product of that, not the other way around.  
Does that mean the west is perfect? Not at all. Should it be morally perfect? Not at all, it has to live with people with a very, very different view of the world.

2215,[],False,,sylsau,,,[],,,,text,t2_brc3w,False,False,"First, you need to understand what it means for a country to default on its debt.

A country is considered to be in default when it is unable to honor its financial commitments on time to its creditors, which can be governments, financial institutions (International Monetary Fund, World Bank, etc.), or investors in the financial markets. A default is said to be partial when the government does not repay part of its obligations.

A government itself can declare itself in default by announcing that it stops repaying its debt obligations, as Russia did in 1998, or the announcement can also come from a rating agency after a grace period of 30 days following the declaration of default.

Russia's problem is special here. America has just confirmed that it no longer gives Russia access to the US dollar. De facto, it is no longer able to pay back its debt contracted in American dollars while its foreign currency reserves exceed 400 billion dollars...

Russia, therefore, claims to be a victim of Western sanctions, even though it is able to pay its debt. It has the will to do so, according to the Russian Minister of Finance. Its default would be rather due to Western sanctions.

Russia proposes to pay its creditors in rubles, but in international law, a debt must be repaid in the same currency.

The default of Russia is therefore becoming clearer and we are in the middle of a new episode in this saga that seems endless.

The first consequence of a Russian default would be that creditors would lose the amounts they have lent, but this should not cause a systemic crisis. A debt restructuring arrangement in the midst of a conflict seems irrelevant to debt specialists.

A default automatically cuts a state off from the financial markets and jeopardizes its possible return for a few years. It took twelve years for Russia to be able to return to borrowing on the markets after defaulting on its domestic debt in 1998, at a time when its economy was destabilized by a financial tidal wave from Asia.

Russia would then become a little more of a pariah in the international monetary system. This is not something to frighten Vladimir Putin, who still has the argument of hydrocarbon exports up his sleeve.

This is what should save Russia in the immediate future.

Indeed, bondholders outside the United States can still receive funds. And since most of them are in Europe, there would not be enough creditors left to declare a default, ITI Capital, one of Moscow's largest brokers, told Bloomberg. The threshold for reporting a default is usually set at 25 percent of outstanding bonds.

The Russian debt saga should therefore continue in the coming months!",215b28b70a8c69997622d12a0ee9b905bbfdb5b3,True,False,,,,,0,1653835555,,0,{},iafk89m,True,t3_v0cnei,False,True,t3_v0cnei,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v0cnei/new_episode_in_the_russian_debt_saga_putins/iafk89m/,1653835565,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653806755.0,

I did after all mention there are some older tanks etc stored, but they require refurbishment (and training, I might add).
Yes, permissions from the government are slow to come, and for now Leopards and Marders are just as off limits as M60s or M1s (although that may change at least for the Marders). But with regard to the Gepards, it's the refurbishment and training leading to a first delivery in July rather than any time sooner.

Ukraine itself seems quite aware of how to work Germany to get what it wants. Much more so than the current Germany-bashing Redditor botniks. As evident from this recent quote from Ukraine's foreign minister:

""We understand it's more difficult for Germany than for others, so we decided to follow this development with a strategic patience""
This was said with regard to requesting Marder and Leopard tanks.

&gt; Oh I have read it multiple times, I just assumed you were referring to the link which you shared that broke down what was contributed.

Well, I was rather explicit I stating what I was referring to, but never mind, water under the bridge. At least we finally figured out why you were wrong.

Feel free to request evidence whenever you need it.

https://news.sky.com/story/germany-fears-recession-if-heavy-reliance-on-russian-gas-is-reduced-too-quickly-12601003

That’s the “gas can’t be phased out quickly” argument. It’s well known, I have made it a few times myself. Nothing spectacularly new there, nothing to support “cosy up to Russia to the exclusion of other EU nations” though. 

&gt; No it's not, that is what is in the news and in various articles.

It is. 

&gt; Again, nope. That is literally the tweet posted by an official German Parliament twitter....Again, just because you don't like it doesn't make it wrong

Feel free to link me the tweet where Scholz said Ukraine should allow their genocide? I suspect that part is your own malicious invention. 

&gt; And yet they have the second largest arms industry in Europe. I know the German army is a farce and that they can barely equip their own rapid reaction brigade, but given Scholz is apparently all about pacifism why not just give it all away?

Good question. I wouldn’t mind, but that would be a radical move, and mean the end of the NATO contingents on the eastern flank. 

&gt; There is when you are initiating diplomacy on behalf of a country without being asked and without giving them the courtesy of letting them know.

Do we know the Ukrainians were out of the loop?

&gt; Also, when the discussion includes blatant lies by the aggressor it puts into question the validity of the call.

Why? Because Putin is dishonest? That’s on Putin, not on Macron and Scholz. 

&gt; Orthography isn't just about spelling. It also includes grammar as that is a key aspect of the spoken language which is being represented in text.

Your orthography was wrong, i.e. the spelling, not your grammar.

Yes.

But they got their own identity ... long ago. I can more speak about USA than Canada, but a few things are specific to their culture:

* country music, soul music, rap music etc culture --- really, you guys are MUCH more into music than most of Europe or Asia
* weapon culture
* dating culture
* american barbecue culture

... and probably a lot more.

&gt; has all these really old dessert recipes

I think with food it is so-so. I'm sure a bit of the food is retained. But often not in original form, even when claimed so.

One anecdotal story: many years ago I went to a congress in Abilene, Texas. And through the charity organization that I worked for, I got the chance to sleep away my jet-lag in Houston. From there I rented a car, and went to Abilene (and later a bit to Carlsberg Caverns and into New Mexico to White sands, to have some touristy things as well). 

So really, the people that took me for a night were extremely nice people --- even so nice, that they presented me a ""german cake"". However, this cake wasn't german at all. It was an american cake. It was as colorful and sweet as american cakes are. And here in Germany I know a lot of cakes --- none of them were similar to what I got.

I learned from this that a lot of things the USA people think ""This is the europe way"" is just some distorted view, because they don't know better. And not out of bad will. For example, my hosts never left their country ever. They simply don't know that german food isn't overly sweet, that we hardly use corn sirup. And back then they immigrated, noone in Germany ever used corn (it's from the americans) and few people had sugar, sugar was a luxury. So arguing that they do the cake now as they did it 200 years ago doesn't sound sensible, either.

Similarly, if you go Frankenmuth, Michigan and see their version of ""german christmas"" ... no, that's not german at all.",41864773efbbfea6bf599fc58c8387502a0d22dd,True,False,,,,,0,1653830972,,0,{},iafb08u,False,t3_uzvv3v,False,False,t1_iaf5tgj,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uzvv3v/how_ukrainian_defenders_show_their_gratitude_to/iafb08u/,1653830986,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653802172.0,

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

""It is incredible how the leaders of France and Germany are inadvertently paving the way for new acts of violence by Russia. Macron and Scholz's 80-minute phone call with Putin today makes one paraphrase the former – is this not a case of being braindead?"" Mihkelson wrote on social media.

The committee chair admitted that while his criticism of allies is sharp, efforts to legitimize the person who unleashed the war and is responsible for the crimes committed place allies everywhere at risk.

""How is it possible neither Paris nor Berlin have learned from history? Why are excuses being sought to hold back arms for Ukraine and why is it presumed that Putin, currently waging a war on a major European people, intends to keep any promise?"" Mihkelson asked.

The MP said that if Macron and Scholz are worried about the looming food crisis in North Africa and elsewhere due to Russia blocking Ukrainian ports, efforts should be aimed at putting together a humanitarian aid convoy and helping Ukrainian ships get through.

Mihkelson added that it would make more sense to help Ukraine stand up to Russian aggression and ultimately achieve victory over Russia that is attempting to change the world order.

""Macron and Scholz should hang up the phone and book a trip to Ukraine post haste. I hope their peculiar actions are not motivated by fear of losing influence in democratic Europe which Ukraine would surely enter after winning the war, alongside the outlooks of Moldova and Georgia and Belarus finally shaking the de facto Russian occupation there. Europe as a whole would be rid of the existential threat that is Russia at least for a period. Tell me that is not worth displaying the leadership skills of statesmen representing democratic values and principles. Luckily, Europe has the brave men and women of Ukraine who know the price of freedom. Long live Ukraine!"" Mihkelson wrote.

Marders are still under discussion, Leopards aren't at this point, although Ukraine would love to get some. Problem being that Marders and Leopards are seen much more as offensive vehicles, which Germany is extremely reluctant to supply.
Personally, I do see some Marders being delivered, but Ukrainian Leopards (even Mk 1) I have a hard time imagining any time soon.

You must have a very low comprehension capability.

Currently, Ukraine do have ZERO people that can operate a PzH2000. So if the devices are sent to Ukraine, they will have to put into a military depot. A sitting duck.

Once the Ukraine people are trained, they can man the PzH2000 and use it. Part of this usage is that they move it a lot --- they can even move after each shot, if they want. The artillery computer will cope for that. And that means the PzH2000 is of course in much less danger of getting destroyed by Russia compared to sitting for days without movement in some depot.

I also have a story to back up my point. Most people will argue that the russian soldier in the soviet army fought only against enemies so their actions, to themselves were justified (those action being stealing, looting, destroying, killing raping, etc), but that is false, because in 1917 when the russian revolution happened, Russia and Romania (my country) were allied. Before the revolution you would catch a russian soldier stealing once in a while, very rarely killing a Romanian citizen, but the moment the fuckers got the message that bolsheviks started an uprising and that they are no longer forced to fight in the war the russian STOLE, PILLAGED, RAPED and KILLED like there was no tomorrow. Motherfuckers were allied with Romanians for 1.5 years in the war, but that went immediately out the window when no longer forced to take part in the war.

I did not say that. I said that they are still being refurbished, completely independent of an approval. 

&gt; Rheinmetall states completely the opposite

I'd really love a source for that - cause Rheinmetall itself said [2 weeks ago](https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/innenpolitik/ukraine-waffen-panzer-rheinmetall-103.html) that the first units (which will only be a couple) will be ready in 3 weeks. With a bit of mathematics you may arrive at the fact that they are not finished yet and that the full amount of 100 will take *way* longer. Its simply not true that there are a 100 Marders just waiting for the approval

&gt; While Bild clearly says ""refused

That article is behind a paywall and the headline is literally not saying that. Moreover Bild is a famously shitty tabloid aligned with the opposition which sees this as a great opportunity to create a mood against the government.

&gt; The deal is that Ukraine asked for Marders because there is a war there, Germany refused, you try to deny this fact by persistently telling lies and playing fool.

My lies are literally the truth. The Marders are neither ready nor would the whole 100 get delivered right away despite your wrong claims. They are being refurbished independently of the governments decisions so there isnt even time lost right now. As i mentioned, other western countries arent sending anything either, so why exactly is germany the only bad guy here?

&gt; If this is something that needs to be explained then you are either a moron or a troll, either way, I'm not interested in communicating with any of you anymore.

I hope in my heart that you're right. But ... we don't yet know.

* we don't have how long the war lasts
* we don't know how demolished Ukraine will be
* we don't know if we can coerce money out of Russia to help the rebuild
* we don't know if the west really is giving lots of money for the Ukrainian cause (e.g. at the last G7 meeting, USA gave the most, Germany the 2nd most, and the other countries almost nothing)
* we don't know how the Ukrainians will integrate into their host countries

The last point is important. For example, when the Serbs started to slaughter the Kosovorians, a lot of people fleed to Germany (and probably to other countries). And they settled, learned the language. From Germany's point of view, this was only temporarily, until the war was over. In the end, Germany helped with others in the KFOR troops to pacify the area. Now, on paper, all the refugees would have to go home. But ... some of them were in the middle of a school. Some were in a vacational education. Some in the middle of their study, before the M.A. for example. Some were totally integrated, with local friends and all. It was seen cruel to send them back, into poverty. So we had a lot of ""church asylum"" cases over here, where churches took them in so that they didn't get forcibly deported back, after the reason for their Asylum got voided.

So this is a two edged sword: on one side, it's MUCH better for the people to get integrated. For their income, for their mental health --- it's even cheaper for the hosting country. But on the other side this makes it far more difficult to send them back --- one would need to have stone-cold heart.

&gt; ""western values"" consist exclusively in the ability of producing and sending/selling weapons

The western values are ... hollow and ballooned. We speak of freedom, democracy, human rights ... and then we (in this case the USA) invade Iran, kill 150'000 people directly --- that is even more than the russians so far killed in Ukraine --- and later, due to power vacuum and it's chaos with civil war and ISIS, another 350'000 people die. (The 500'000 people died in this war is from a study of the University of Washington).

And no one bats an eye, no one wants to sanction the USA. No one says ""Germany is responsible for this war --- like people now want to make us be the reason for the Russian aggression ---, because they buy Ford cars and Apple smartphones"". It was just normal to do it ... in the western world, that is.

So really, our values are only very selectively applied.

Yes, and he clearly understood you, this is why he is mad.  
  
Because it being civil war is **Russian version of events and their propaganda**. In reality it was never civil war - it was local coup orchestrated by Russian undercover agents and bought out locals. If it was ""civil war"" it would already end. It never ended because it was not - any time there was danger of things being resolved, Russia entered with unmarked military forces to stir things up. But framing it as ""civil war"" was more convenient for EU because that would mean they don't really have to react to it or do anything right now. Basically, it allowed everyone to close their eyes and pretend that Russia is not invading Ukraine for 8 years.

No, Russia is derived from Rus, and Belarus is derived from Rus. Setting Rus and Russia equal would hint at Belarus being derived from Russia (which it isn't).

""Going to struggle"" is far too optimistic.  I don't think I can overemphasize how every aspect of Ukraine's economy has been devastated.  IT professionals will do fine, but not many beyond that.    And 40b is a drop in the bucket compared to what Ukraine will need to get back on its feet.

 ""I think Russia is heading for some kind of collapse,""

Maybe.  This is the dream.

 ""and in that power vacuum. Ukraine could, in theory, develop into a regional power.""

This can only be the sort of comically silly analysis done by somebody who has never even been to the region.  This is nonsense beyond words.

""But Ukraine has insane natural resources as well as surprisingly fertile soil. And their manufacturing is surprisingly advanced for such a poor country.""

Agribusiness will come back in Ukraine, but it has very little value in terms of making ukraine prosperous beyond a minimum baseline.  ""manufacturing is surprisingly advanced"" - not really.  We have seen small to medium sized investments by foreign companies to take advantage of ukraine's relatively cheap workforce.   But, this is a recipe for a baseline economy only.

&gt;No goalposts are moving. I replied to what you said. If counterarguments confuse you that much, maybe don’t engage in discussions.

I'm not confused. You are the one who kept changing the focus to suit your needs as if it would justify your position. First it was tanks and now your fixation has shifted to AA systems.

&gt;And I am meant to know you had decided to use a completely different metric?  
&gt;  
&gt;Read again what I wrote, it was clearly stated what metric I used.

Oh I have read it multiple times, I just assumed you were referring to the link which you shared that broke down what was contributed. I am sorry I don't have a crystal ball to know you were talking about something different.

&gt;You are the pro-Scholz try hard, why not do your own research like you keep telling me.  
&gt;  
&gt;Nah, you make a claim, you back it up.

Says the guy making various claims without any shred of evidence.

&gt;Following the NATO summit it came out that Germany supposedly has an informal agreement with unnamed NATO members to not supply heavy equipment to Russia for fear of escalation (WTF?!?!)  
&gt;  
&gt;Gross misrepresentation of what has been claimed.

No it's not, that is what is in the news and in various articles. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean its gross misrepresentation.

&gt;Scholz gave a lovely speech including a bit that essentially asked the question ""should violence answer violence or should peace be the reponse to violence?""...So in his warped little world apparently the correct Ukrainian response should be to lay down their weapons and just allow their genocide to take place. What a tosser  
&gt;  
&gt;Gross misrepresentation again.

Again, nope. That is literally the tweet posted by an official German Parliament twitter....Again, just because you don't like it doesn't make it wrong

&gt;It has come out that in the last 9 weeks only 2 military aid shipments have happened from Germany. The most recently approved of which was grenades and landmines. So helpful and just what the Ukrainians need!  
&gt;  
&gt;Unlike the US, Germany isn’t in the habit of invading foreign countries anymore. There aren’t huge stockpiles of weapons sitting around.

And yet they have the second largest arms industry in Europe. I know the German army is a farce and that they can barely equip their own rapid reaction brigade, but given Scholz is apparently all about pacifism why not just give it all away?

&gt;Oh and let's not forget that it has come out that the Germany army has nearly 70 Marders that are in working condition which they aren't using for anything...Marders which Ukraine has been begging for and offering to buy but which Scholz has been saying don't exist.  
&gt;  
&gt;Link? I find this: “In dem internen Schriftstück heißt es laut dem Bericht, die Bundeswehr verfüge über 62 ""Marder"", die nicht mehr genutzt würden. Das Blatt zitiert aus dem Dokument von Mitte Mai: ""Von diesen könnten 32 Fahrzeuge bei Bedarf instandgesetzt und dann wieder genutzt werden."" Weitere 30 ""Marder"" eigneten sich demnach ""nur noch zur Ersatzteilgewinnung"".” That’s 32 Marders that could be made operational again, although how fast isn’t clear, and 30 only useful to harvest spare parts.

I might be incorrect on this point, and I think that is what I saw too. So i will admit I am wrong there.

&gt;Scholz and Macron has a joint conference call with Putin about the war (without consulting with Ukraine or Zelensky).  
&gt;  
&gt;There’s nothing wrong with diplomacy.

There is when you are initiating diplomacy on behalf of a country without being asked and without giving them the courtesy of letting them know. Also, when the discussion includes blatant lies by the aggressor it puts into question the validity of the call. Given that Putin lied to them and said Kyiv was unwilling to engage I would say its kind of a big deal, especially when Kyiv has said they are willing. It is Putin who has refused to talk to Zelensky. It was also the Ukrainians who took the risk of going to hostile Belarus to start negotiations at the start of the war. 

&gt;Nice use of google there. Apologies for not using perfect grammar on reddit.  
&gt;  
&gt;Didn’t t have to google that, and it’s your orthography that’s faulty, not your grammar.

Orthography isn't just about spelling. It also includes grammar as that is a key aspect of the spoken language which is being represented in text.

The other thing is: many western countries are out of stock of things they can give.

So far the doctrine was:

"" NATO doesn't give modern things (USA gives M1 Abrahms, Germany Leopard 2 - if you can call this modern) for fear of escalation
* NATO is free to give old junk (e.g. soviet era tanks from Poland or Czech). Unfortunately Germany doesn't have them)
* giving thinks like anti-air and anti-tank weapons, mines, bunkerbusters, machine guns etc os okay (Germany gave a lot of this)

And from the in-stock devices, we see lots of obstacles

* no consensus inside NATO if it can ve given (e.g. the polish fighter planes)
* containing too many NATO secrets (e.g. Patriot, so germany put Patriot outside the reach of Russia, and UA got S-300 instead)
"" training times (early in the war it was said takes too long to train. But you need to gonna start with the training). But even when training is currently done (as e.g. with the UA soldiers in Idar-Oberstein and Aachen), it's not seen as a good thing

Partially the underfunding is to blame,but also the military industry, which is abysmal slow and likes to balloon prices (most military projects cost 3x as much as originally told)
* personality of the executive that doesn't want to escalate (like the german chancellor or the french president). They draw a history to WW1 where originally the governments didn't want the war, but have been pressured into it by public meaning
* some of the weapons UA selected on their own aren't in the Bundeswehr since several years anymore (e.g. Gepard). So german army don't have them, don't have the ammunition, hardly has people that can train UA soldiers. So UA is now experiencing some of the slowness of KMW and the supply-chain problems the Bundeswehr suffered. Just that the Bundeswehr was (too) patient in history with the suppliers. And the UA cannot afford to be patient.
* some of the few working weapons are needed for NATO duties, which accusers always ignore
* decade long neglect, because western europe didn't had a foe for real

And all of this slows things down unfortunately. It's a bit of everything.

A contraction of 2% is less than pleasant, but it's not ""sky falling"" collapse you make it sound to be. That's also the worst case scenario. This isn't your ""40%"" because industry=/=economy. You guys have agriculture and more importantly a massive service sector. Frankfurt is the biggest financial hub in the EU now that the UK left. The service sector makes up 70% of your economy.


In other words you're being hyperbolic to justify shitty German policy.

Then again a former chancellor secured the Nordstream project then went to become a manager of it so I guess I shouldn't expect much.

* There's a ""trickle of reinforcements"" from shadow mobilisation with second and third line reserve units being formed using older equipment. Even full mobilisation would have delay of a few months before impact on battlefield.
* Possible disconnect between political figures in Kremlin (optimism - ""new assault on Kyiv"") and military assessments. Military view may not be infinite advance from Donetsk/Luhansk oblasts but towards more sustainable defensible lines.
* ""Nowhere near any kind of meaningful peace conversation"". Ceasefire would fix battlelines for the moment and neither Russia nor Ukraine want that. No point trying to push for something which isn't politically achievable - more about those proposing wanting to wish away this war.

One can make up for the other to some extent, so if you're not brainwashed enough to believe the propaganda you might still have hopes you just survive and will soon be able to get home. Or you are inherently a pessimistic person who never had a lot of experience with being lucky and things going well, but you are so brainwashed that you believe overall things must be going swimmingly, so you also keep going.

The amount of people who are both pessimistic enough to not be under copium as well as resisted propaganda enough to know that it's just huge bullshit going on and nothing else will be very low. And since there are some few of them, they can't rely on their fellow soldiers to join in the mutiny, if anything there is a chance they will oppose it and shoot you right in the spot (remember those are mostly uneducated, young farmers, they don't care much about due process with courts and everything, they act impulsively). Sure, they could try to convince the others in joining the rebellion, but that would make them a key figure, a leader and instigator, meaning it would be high risk.

So the only thing left for them is to escape on their own. Either by defecting and trying to get back to Russia, or by approaching the Ukrainians and surrendering.

If you get captured during war, the risk for repercussions at home are rather low, because it happens a lot during war (unless you unit had no enemy contact and was rather behind the lines, and you somehow end up captured, this might beg some questions). But successfully approaching the enemy soldiers is a huge risk, as you might get shot, either accidentally or because the Ukrainians don't feel like dealing with a POW right now (they're only human, too, and you invaded their country and chances are they already lost someone in this war. So it's like a fifty fifty chanve of actually being successful, or they just execute you). Then it also depends what you did so far in the war. If you committed atrocities chances are the Ukrainian intelligence will find out and you get sentenced to life in prison.

You can also try to get back to Russia. But how? On foot? What if you get asked who you are and what you are doing on the way back, never mind if you have your uniform or stole some plain clothes. How do you do that? You could steal a car and make it on your way back, but how do you get through Russian lines? If you saw the video of that BMP obliterating that car with the old couple with its 30mm cannon you also know you might get killed by the Russians just because they think you might be a Ukrainian civilian. 

And even if you make it back across the border, then what? Your absence will have been reported, so you can't go back home to your family, as they will be looking for you there. Where do you go? Relatives and friends are also risky. You stay at some other place? How do you pay. You need a job, how do you get a job when you're at large, they can check your bank account, you will need to give your social security or tax number or something. You would need to go fully undercover like a searched criminal or terrorist. But unlike those who move in the proper circles which can give them the knowledge needed, how will you know what to do and what absolutely to avoid in order to not be caught?

So yeah. Talk is cheap.

I don't want it to sound like Ukraine is going to sweep over Russia and everything will be happy sunshine. Things are going to get worse long before they get better. 

However, assuming the West keeps supporting Ukraine. I do believe they'll win this in the long run. I think Russia is heading for some kind of collapse, and in that power vacuum. Ukraine could, in theory, develop into a regional power. 

It might take decades. But Ukraine has insane natural resources as well as surprisingly fertile soil. And their manufacturing is surprisingly advanced for such a poor country. 

Now, that entirely depends on how much the West is willing to support Ukraine. Ukraine could replace Western gas needs if given the investment, and they have a lot uramium. But dealing with Russia might simply be considered ""easier.""

Firing tables and spread sheets: the less commander has to use calculator, the better.

Relocating is about logistics. Artillery commander tells the ETA and if the route sucks, they will get there late. That's warfare. The more experience the commander has, the more accurately he can estimate the time.

No goalposts are moving. I replied to what you said. If counterarguments confuse you that much, maybe don’t engage in discussions. 

&gt; And I am meant to know you had decided to use a completely different metric?

Read again what I wrote, it was clearly stated what metric I used. 

&gt; You are the pro-Scholz try hard, why not do your own research like you keep telling me. 

Nah, you make a claim, you back it up. 

&gt; Following the NATO summit it came out that Germany supposedly has an informal agreement with unnamed NATO members to not supply heavy equipment to Russia for fear of escalation (WTF?!?!)

Gross misrepresentation of what has been claimed. 

&gt; Scholz gave a lovely speech including a bit that essentially asked the question ""should violence answer violence or should peace be the reponse to violence?""...So in his warped little world apparently the correct Ukrainian response should be to lay down their weapons and just allow their genocide to take place. What a tosser

Gross misrepresentation again. 

&gt; It has come out that in the last 9 weeks only 2 military aid shipments have happened from Germany. The most recently approved of which was grenades and landmines. So helpful and just what the Ukrainians need! 

Unlike the US, Germany isn’t in the habit of invading foreign countries anymore. There aren’t huge stockpiles of weapons sitting around. 

&gt; Oh and let's not forget that it has come out that the Germany army has nearly 70 Marders that are in working condition which they aren't using for anything...Marders which Ukraine has been begging for and offering to buy but which Scholz has been saying don't exist.

Link?

&gt; Scholz and Macron has a joint conference call with Putin about the war (without consulting with Ukraine or Zelensky).

There’s nothing wrong with diplomacy.

We don't have an official term yet for Putin's flavour of political regime. William Gibson saw it in 1993. It's the KOMBINAT.William Gibson has a good record of anticipating the future. Famously he coined the term ""cyberpunk""in his first novel in 1984 in which he set the popular perception of the internet. He is famous for that first trilogy of books, but his second trilogy, known as the Bridge trilogy, quickly fell victim to the law of ""nothing dates as fast as yesterdays tomorrow"".  Published in the early 1990s and set only a decade later, the Bridge books still read pretty cool noir but it's an alternate future with no phones or Web 2.0. Some might prefer this nightmare dystopia /s.

Admittedly he's only a decade away, but some things Gibson gets pretty on the nose. Pandemics, which seemed to begin with HIV, are now a regular occurrence. As per the first trilogy the middle class is shrinking fast and society is dividing into tech driven super rich and crime inflected everyone else. Crime is riddled with Russian money and it has a solid political origin. ""Kombinat"" is the name given by Gibson to an evolved Communist state which is now explicitly controlled by organised crime. It seems to be sanctioned by all the other states of Gibson's Bridge world so operatives are actively acquiring new technology from locations like San Francisco and Japan. 

You might respond immediately that for all it's issues Putin's Russia is not communist! It is extreme capitalism! Well, give it time, because the more Putin's state walks like the Soviet Union, and quacks like the Soviet Union, the more those weird years in the middle look like a Weimar daydream without the sexy dancers.

Having given the Kombinat a name suddenly it's place in history looks a lot less accidental, a lot more familiar. It is common currency now to compare Putin with Hitler (""Putler"") but less so to compare his regime explicitly with the Nazi Party. Compare the timelines however - 1918-1933, and 1987-2000. 

The fall of Kaserine Germany without invasion. The fall of the Soviet Union without a hot war. Economic chaos follows alongside liberalism. Nationalism as a excuse to unify. Idolisation of the past. Hatred of the future. Staged terrorism events to justify crack downs.

Soviet Union like Imperial Germany has a once mighty proud empire lost in a war that barely touches the homeland, creating no sense of real defeat. The undefeated younger generation of the old regime uses gangsterism and brutality to return to power based on militarism nationalism. and unrestrained capitalism.In its first form this state is highly confident and aggressively expansionist. Though Imperial Germany seemed to coming to its senses late in 1914 and the Soviets barely had the resources to invade a third world state at the end, their expansionist ambitions were baked into the political mindset for the rest of the world to see.

In its second form the Nazi/Kombinat is still expansionist but only as part of a self pitying litany of grievances for past injustices. Where Imperial Germany/Russia has actual plans for the territories it seeks to acquire, the Nazi/Kombinat barely has a plan beyond invade and then “watch the world burn"". There is no self justified philosophy of ""white man’s burden"" here, just looting, rape and destruction that would shame the Mongols.

Though explicitly non anti Semitic in its earlier more intellectual form in Imperial Germany/Soviet Union the more aggressive populist Nazi/Kombinat is bitter narrow minded and obsessively anti-Jew.Some of this analysis falls apart when you consider the chasm between the class background of Imperial Prussians and Soviet leaders, and perhaps there are less actual war vets in Putin’s regime than there were in Hitler's, but the patterns of behaviour and outlook do look remarkably similar to me, and if we are looking for a term for Putin’s flavour of Nazism - KOMBINAT is as good as any I’ve come across.",b543a8030bb3cb10433ade6caed6960a46418074,True,False,,,,,0,1653817404,,0,{},iaes4o9,True,t3_v07pw0,False,True,t3_v07pw0,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v07pw0/putins_kombinat_is_to_the_soviet_union_what_the/iaes4o9/,1653817419,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653788604.0,

Money is power and they have the biggest economy worldwide bc so many countries not just ours have been buying their products in a surge for the last 20 years. China has the bucks and the bucks mean the means to buy weapons. More population means more available service members of their armed services and reservists available. More GDP and a farther reaching stance on the global trade between countries means more countries would likley be apprehensive to join us to fight China. Strategically us presence has very little airbase presence in the area. I won’t call you dumb but I’ll say you’ve been blinded by blind allegiance to a fault which has caused a loss of general logic on the matter. I admire your patriotism or whatever but the reality is China is not the same country or gdp that they were 20 years ago. We’re not immortal with unlimited power. Biggest hurdles to impose the us will over there is location and not having as strong of a gdp as China. 

The thing is to each of you that have given negative remarks against me you have all shared 1 thing in common. You can’t give any real reasons for your point but to drop a one liner insult. It’s sad and petty and a little odd. Back up what you say with something other than biased blind follower remarks. Break out some facts, points, stats, or something other than sounding like a child just slinging dirt just because you don’t like the situation. Are y’all grown ups? Hopefully us won’t get into any wars with anyone because it’s not financially viable with our weakened economy. Most would probably rather have a lower cost of living than funding 20 years Afghan, or piles of cash and weapons to Ukraine and I hope we don’t try to get into a fight with China. Those are just some of the conflicts there has been so many more. Wars are not free and us is not the biggest game on the rock anymore. 

What do you not like that I don’t like guns? It’s interesting if a gov gets into a war and goes and shoots tons of people in another country but if a single person does they need mental help. Um a gun is a gun and a shooter is a shooter and if a person gets killed by another it’s still a killing if it’s self defense but premeditated is murder. To me gums are bad and it’s 2022 we should have figured out a better way to live with one another by now. It’s like damn stupid is as stupid does type crap. 

So if Ukraine losses who is going to recover all those excess weapons? The thing is russia didn’t need to invade them to survive in life. Just like China doesent need to invade tawain to survive. It’s a want and not a need. Sometimes when countries really want something like we have wanted oil b4 can sway those in power to put that above human lives. It’s all not very cool.

But: due zo the companies slowness in repairing, only 40 or so are working. And they are needed for the NATO crisis forces, where Germany currently provided 1/4th of the material + personnel. Next year even 1/3rd. They are e.g. in the Baltics.

The company suggested that they could build new PzH2000 for the Bundeswehr in the meantime. Cool, or? When asked for the timeframe, they said this will take at least till 2026.

They all gather around, like 8 people, splitting a chocolate bar. Man they look so happy, going like ""this is why white people are so healthy, they eat this"". The hilarious innocence juxtaposed against the horrible system of capitalism is such a weird mix and the raw (positive) emotions in it always puts me in a good mood while leaving me dwelling on the unfairness of the world.


Hands down if I could I'd give chocolate to people who hadn't tasted it; every day. Even adults will light up with unbridled childish joy. It speaks on a fundamental across cultures (and varied expressions) and I can't help but grin myself like a stupid child when I see their joy.


They look so disappointed when there's no more chocolate, but luckily the guy has more chocolate with him.

To make a winding post even longer, my brother told me when he was backpacking through India, he had a taxi driver in Mumbai that would wait with his car outside the hotel every day, even though my brother and his friend might not even go out that day. One day they go into a store and buy one can of cola soda each, but when they give it to the driver, he puts it away. It being so warm, they asked surprised why he'd save it. He said ""saving it for my son. He hasn't tasted real Coca Cola before.""


Totally blew their minds.


I don't think people truly understand how 'lucky' we westerners are. These little joys are absolutely privileges that most people do not have.


Another thing is working toilets. It's just crazy that Russian soldiers steal toilets and misuse them.

2. Scholz gave a lovely speech including a bit that essentially asked the question ""should violence answer violence or should peace be the reponse to violence?""...So in his warped little world apparently the correct Ukrainian response should be to lay down their weapons and just allow their genocide to take place. What a tosser
3. It has come out that in the last 9 weeks only 2 military aid shipments have happened from Germany. The most recently approved of which was grenades and landmines. So helpful and just what the Ukrainians need! Oh and let's not forget that it has come out that the Germany army has nearly 70 Marders that are in working condition which they aren't using for anything...Marders which Ukraine has been begging for and offering to buy but which Scholz has been saying don't exist.
4. Scholz and Macron has a joint conference call with Putin about the war (without consulting with Ukraine or Zelensky). A call in which Putin perpetuated his lies about the War, the actions of Russian soldiers, his goals and the upcoming global food crisis (blaming everything on Ukraine). Also during the call, he warned two of the most timid (in terms of support) countries about the ""risks of western weapons ending up in Ukraine. 

And you wonder why I question the German support of Ukraine.....

&gt;And yes, a simple spelling mistake is the most important thing to focus on, if we are playing that game...""It's spelled with an a, by the way"".  
&gt;  
&gt;Just a side note, it’s always annoying when native speakers have poor orthography.

Nice use of google there. Apologies for not using perfect grammar on reddit.

&gt;They made the decision to change in Feb (After the war started, and as the international community started applying pressure to anyone and everyone linked to Russia), and started building. It's funny how other nations made the decision BEFORE the war started in response to the Donbas and Crimea, but not good old Germany.

https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-olaf-scholz-ukraine-tank-military-support-conundrum/

&gt; When Scholz last month bowed to pressure and agreed to send some heavy weapons, he surprised the Ukrainians, allies and experts with his decision to provide anti-aircraft tanks, which Kyiv hadn’t asked for, while continuing to hold off on the delivery of the battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles Ukraine had been urging the West to send. 

One or two of these sidesteps is maybe a misunderstanding, but there's a pattern, Germany getting heat isn't Russian trolls as the comment that kicked off this thread suggests. You say stuff like ""we need an expert license"", which is countered in that article, ""we can't send that because it needs training"" which is countered in that article. Some of the excuses you've said in this thread aren't even the current excuses Germany is giving.

I don't care to do the Germany said this someone else said that back and forth anymore. If somehow this is all everyone else's fault as you suggest, Poland misunderstood, Ukraine misunderstood, then the pressure will lesson as arms arrive, this is the price of Germanies foreign policy on Russia and changing reasons for not helping as much as expected. If it is just excuses tho then the pressure will build because every refusal to help will increasingly be picked apart. But blaming this on Russian trolls, as was done at the start of this comment thread, feels like more of the ""don't blame Germany it's everyone else at fault"" narrative.",af4327a2a398cbcb046e1cc3d2f7a025c1747ac0,True,False,,,,,0,1653807607,,0,{},iaeh5zp,False,t3_uzobm2,False,True,t1_iadey36,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uzobm2/cacciarijournalistthe_only_positive_thing_is_that/iaeh5zp/,1653807620,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653778807.0,

Russia had a minor defensive perimeter around Bilohirka where Ukraine first crossed the Inhulets River and as they have surpassed that I am guessing Russia may not have much south of there for quite some ways. 

There is no direct road from Bilohirka to Kostromka so I am wondering if they are simply crossing country or if they also are sweeping down the T2207.  There maybe farmers trails that they are using.  I have to think there is some potential for Russian having mined the area like crazy and hopefully the local farmers can help with routes.

I am going to be upbeat as I think Russia is in a weak position up here -Russia apparently has a lot of artillery in the area but I am assuming Ukraine can counter that with drone directed counter artillery and air support via attack helicopters and SU-25s.

I am really curious to see how this develops as if they intend to go further south they are also going to have to attack on other vectors or their flank will be exposed - Russia did have a fair contingent of soldiers in Davydiv Brid just to the east not all that long ago.",e1a6d1f6b7026ff557e92bec6521212f0168a1b3,True,False,,,,,0,1653806166,,0,{},iaefgc6,False,t3_v03y4x,False,True,t3_v03y4x,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v03y4x/according_to_the_ukrainian_general_staff_fighting/iaefgc6/,1653806180,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653777366.0,

Are you sure? How do you know the positions are Ukrainians? How do you know Russia doesn't shoot a few Ukrainian speakers as part of its psyops?

But I don't care about individual people complaining. Good luck finding any war in the history of the planet where the soldier on the front line is totally happy with military leadership and supplies. I'm more interested in ""whole battalions desert"".

&gt; One does not cancel out the other.

It just illustrates that while both might complain, one is actually in a much worse position than the other.

&gt; Then, when the last line of defense is destroyed, they simply flee and die in an open field from artillery.

Not really. There are tons of videos of their artillery working from an open field. Russia barely has intel, drones and communications. By the time its artillery gets the coordinates, there's nobody there. Its artillery is only good at shelling areas, it loses every duel.

&gt; But cruise missiles are still flying, and every day almost the entire territory of Ukarina is sounded by air raid alerts.

A couple of cruise missiles a day, yes. And they're sometimes having to resort to missiles from the 60s. They can't use them to attack everything they want.

&gt; Ukraine has at its disposal neutered M-777s without a digital fire control system. But even this number is negligible. Adviser to the President of Ukraine Arestovich directly speaks about this.

The lack of digital fire control only prevents using the Excalibur shells, which they probably don't have anyway. And in what circumstances would you expect the presidential advisor to say ""ok, now we have enough, thank you""? Of course he complains to put pressure on allies.

I believe the massacre on the river crossing under Belohorivka was done using M777. Extremely accurate, extremely lethal.

&gt; And this is confirmed by Ukrainian prisoners of war whose account goes to several thousand.

Do you seriously listen to what a person with a gun at his head tells you? Come on... Likewise, some civilians in Mariupol say Azov shelled their homes. Of course they do. Otherwise, they starve, and lose any chance of Russia compensating them in the future if Mariupol stays occupied. What choice do they have?

The fact that Ukraine doesn't allow anyone without military experience to be enlisted kinda suggests that they have enough volunteers.

&gt; most of these people are in the third line reserve.

This is coming from Strelkov, do you want a link. They are used in the front lines. They are thrown at Ukrainian positions to uncover machine gun nests, artillery etc. Yes, their life expectancy is about 20 minutes.

&gt; There aren't that many people in this region.

What's the population of the city of Donetsk alone?

&gt; How did it happen that Vietnam fucked the USA?

The US couldn't attack northern Vietnam, it was protected by China. They also confidently won every battle. But that's not enough to win the war. Russia is far from winning every battle.

&gt; anyone knows that the offensive requires a ratio of 3v1 (at least) Russia did not even have this

Individual troops are less important than tanks and planes. Russia has 10 to 1 advantage where it counts.

And you're telling me that Russia is retarded, because it's trying to continue an offensive war at a disadvantage?

&gt; 2,500 thousand people surrendered from Azovstal

How do you know? Who told you?

&gt; Only on this resource there are about 2600 thousand prisoners of war, each signed with an individual number and photograph.

How do you know they don't make up the data? Who is in charge of this telegram channel, is it official?

&gt; Since April, Ukarina has not shown a single frame of Russian prisoners. 

Again, why would you expect them to show photos of all prisoners? Have they done it before? But I already explained - the way Ukraine is fighting the war, they're not likely to be able to take prisoners even when winning. They never get close enough to take prisoners. What's surprising here?

&gt; With such losses, Russia would have lost the war long ago.

Russia already had 50-60k casuaties (dead or wounded) so far, according to NATO data, and lost 1/3 of the army in total. That's how a massive assault on the whole country from 7 sides turned into a lazy attempt to encircle one city.

&gt; In reality, Russia will simply erase Ukarin's positions from the face of the earth with artillery.

And, again, disproportionally die doing that.",ef355a0129e858785521051c76132148b2f54141,True,False,,,,,0,1653805302,,0,{},iaeeeyz,False,t3_uz3ci4,False,True,t1_iad6gm2,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uz3ci4/ukrainian_air_forces_shot_down_russian_su35_this/iaeeeyz/,1653805319,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653776502.0,

*****
&gt; On the ninth day of Vladimir Putin&amp;#039;s war in Ukraine, editor-in-chief Viktor Muchnik gathered the staff of TV2 for a meeting at their small newsroom in the Siberian city of Tomsk.

&gt; &amp;quot;One reason was professional: the thing you&amp;#039;ve been doing for so long has been killed. The other one was human. Neither of us wanted to be inside this space, in this country which has launched a war, and living among people who support this war,&amp;quot; said Muchnik, in an interview in the Armenian capital Yerevan, where the couple now live, along with tens of thousands of Russians who have fled in the weeks since the war began.

&gt; Now, from Yerevan, the Muchniks keep in touch with journalists from other independent regional outlets who have also fled Russia, trying to coordinate future work.

As long as Hungary has a veto in organizations Ukraine wants to join, Ukraine needs to carefully weigh the *practical benefits* of cutting off pipelines. Those benefits have to exceed the likely diplomatic consequences: that Hungary would publicly commit to vetos.

Russia's oil, specifically, can be, and is predominately, exported by tanker. Cutting off Hungary's pipeline will not significantly reduce the cash being sent to Russia, because much if not all of that same oil production will just go to (another) amoral third world twit. So the practical benefits to Ukraine from an oil pipeline cutoff re: Hungary are minimal, at best.

Now, if Nord Stream 1/2 were inoperative, Poland and Ukraine (who between them control the remaining critical pipeline junctures) should seriously consider the *practical benefits* of cutting off the rest of the feckless Europeans still funding Russia's war via gas purchases. Russia can't export gas by tanker. And it doesn't have the infrastructure to send it anywhere but Europe.

People would simply talk about how these delays are serious and are a long standing deliberate pattern and manipulative excuses are being given and the top comment would always be “hey this anti German bashing is getting old”  it was so absurd at times because of how on some posts about Germany ALL the top comments were hysterical, saying “this is Russian bots isn’t it?!” “The anti German hatred is coming from those who want to drive a wedge between German and the rest of Europe!”.


I was enraged when on one post I saw them straight up prioritising making German look good over actual support of Ukraine as they *insulted Ukrainian officials*.

However, what is probably happening is Ukraine is pulling back to more defensive positions. It's a very flat area, but there are some hills they can use. The river is also key.   


That said. Russia is committing a lot, and they aren't replacing the men they are losing or equipment at any significant rate. So just because they can take it, doesn't mean they can hold it.   


Ukraine is still very much outmatched by Russia head to head. But unlike Russia, they're getting Western arms and training, which will make the difference in the long run. Plus they actually WANT to fight. Ukraine's is and pretty much always has been to bleed Russia and buy time for Western arms and training to arrive.

And even if they did manage to occupy the entire Caucasus, pretty sure the oil fields would be sabotaged to such an extent they would've been useless for approximately 2 years. And even then, the British would just bomb it to smithereens via Iran

In all but name, it's peasantry.

One of the curious distinctions historians have drawn about why the Industrial Revolution happened in Britain, and didn't, simultaneously, happen in France right next door, was due to exactly this ""potential energy"" you're alluding to.

In Britain, they had a booming free class of men (and for military reasons, had essentially emancipated a huge number of what previously would have been peasants).   The critical freedom afforded to them being freedom of movement and employment.

Under the Ancien Regime, you could have started up a factory; only a noble would have had the capital to even try, but ... your chief problem was one of staffing the thing.  You needed a large class of freemen who both were legally free to, but also *had the financial means* to completely uproot themselves and settle down in a new factory town.   You also needed — and this was far more damning, to not merely be ""personally exceptional"" in flouting this problem of a supply of people — you also needed to have your entire supply chain do the same thing.   Factories, only in the simplest setup, take in raw materials.   In almost any even slightly complicated society and manufacturing concern, they need to take in finished goods.   You do not want to be a furniture factory that has to lathe and process their own screws and metal fasteners — that's a venture worthy of an entire factory of its own, but it's harder to start without an industry ready to consume its output.

By Markus Becker , Brussels
05/28/2022, 10:09 am


When Ursula von der Leyen spoke in the Strasbourg European Parliament at the beginning of May , the oil embargo against Russia almost seemed a done deal. The President of the European Commission admitted that some EU countries were “significantly” dependent on Russian oil, but then announced confidently: “We will phase out Russian crude oil supplies within six months and phase out refined products by the end of the year.”

Only three weeks later it is by no means clear whether this will happen. Hungary, which is more dependent on Russian oil than almost any other country, continues to stubbornly block an embargo. Only at the beginning of the week did right-wing head of government Viktor Orbán flatly refuse to discuss the topic at all at the special EU summit on Monday and Tuesday. This would be ""counterproductive"" unless a compromise had been negotiated beforehand, Orbán wrote in a letter to von der Leyen and EU Council President Charles Michel.

Admittedly, the summit agenda is Michel's business. But should the Belgian allow the oil embargo to be discussed and Orbán block it with his veto, the EU would be at odds on the open stage. It is probably not for nothing that there is not a word about a debate on sanctions in Michel's letter of invitation to the heads of state and government, which was published on Friday.
Orban needs money

Orbán is not completely alone in his resistance: Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria are also demanding longer transitional periods for the implementation of an import ban and, in addition, support for the construction of new pipelines worth billions. But the Hungarian is currently under the most pressure.

On the one hand, Orbán urgently needs money after an expensive election campaign   . However, the Commission has been blocking Hungary's billions from the Corona reconstruction fund for months because of numerous concerns about the rule of law. On top of that, the Commission has also linked its latest “REPowerEU” plan to free the EU from Russian energy dependency with the Corona Fund – which is why Hungary is not receiving any money from this pot for the time being either.


On the other hand, the political pressure on Orbán is growing. At the latest since the federal government gave up its resistance to the EU oil embargo, the Hungarian has been the main obstacle to a delivery stop. Orbán has already fallen out with his former closest allies in the EU, above all Poland. Warsaw is now Budapest's ""main antagonist,"" as a Brussels diplomat put it.
Threat from Kyiv: Hungary's oil pipeline ""something could happen""

Particularly threatening for Orbán: Threats are now coming from Ukraine itself. ""Ukraine has a wonderful lever in its hands - the Druzhba oil pipeline,"" Olena Zerkal, a senior Ukrainian diplomat, said on Wednesday at the security forum in Kyiv. The pipeline through which Russian oil flows to Hungary stretches around 600 kilometers across Ukrainian territory. ""Something could happen to her,"" whispered Zerkal. ""And I think it would be very fitting if something happened to her.""

It was a thinly veiled threat to turn off Hungary's oil supply if necessary, garnished with accusations that Orbán was using Russia's war against Ukraine to blackmail the EU into giving him more money. ""Orbán is taking advantage of the situation,"" said Zerkal. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy must decide whether he “wants to speak to Orbán in the language he understands”.

At least that doesn't seem impossible. It was only on Thursday that Selenskyj asked himself in a video message 

why the embargo blockers in the EU were ""allowed so much power, including over intra-European processes"". Orbán, it is said in Brussels, not without glee, should be concerned.

However, it is uncertain whether they will be big enough for Hungary to cave in at the last minute. At a meeting of EU ambassadors on Wednesday, a compromise was still a long way off, according to participants. Another meeting is scheduled for Sunday to find a last-minute compromise.",265419fbcd77ec5fbc9fa21884de98da28249e2e,True,False,,,,,0,1653795022,,0,{},iadzsdt,True,t3_v02q7v,False,False,t3_v02q7v,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v02q7v/should_ukraine_turn_off_the_oil_tap_to_hungary/iadzsdt/,1653795034,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653766222.0,

Aside from F-35, only B2 bombers and a few US Navy ships with the latest combat system upgrades can use MADL.  And the data formats used between MADL and Link16 aren't directly compatible, so it's not trivial to just use something like a Destroyer as a giant Linksys wifi router to send the F-35's data to the other platforms that only speak Link16.  Also, Link16 isn't particularly fast by modern standards.  I think the current generation of Link16 is only like 1 Megabit, so really crappy DSL speeds, or the old iPhone3G from almost 15 years ago.  A lot of older Link16 hardware is still in service that can only handle dial up modem speeds from earlier standards.

It’s not like I like the fact that the east side of Ukraine has been destroyed. I don’t even like guns at all. However your opinion is likley so clouded by the will of the narrative that has been publically bestowed upon you that even standard numbers and statistics about things have you saying things like “you sound retarded” it’s sad and you have a brain up their it is yours and you shouldn’t be afraid to use it and are fully allowed to use it..

If you don’t think the us is always trying to get into other countries little battles than you’ve already proved my point. If you don’t like population numbers and how those change the odds of conflicts than that’s on you. Population numbers make a difference because their are people in every country and a lot of them that their gov and a narrative could be spun for anything and their people will eat it up like gospel. Then at that time they have been basically controlled to the will of the propaganda. It’s happened for ages and ages all over the globe…

I think guns are retarded, I think wars are retarded, I think when countries go to wars that makes them murderers. I like peace and you can be as blinded by your leaders and the narrative of media as you want to.. 

Once you get people going along with a particular narrative and it’s fed to them so deeply it leaches it’s way through a society and infiltrates places where citizens also directly source their livelihood like at the places of work or churches and the like your narrative and control has been attained. Once it reaches that level folks won’t even hardly question you about how much tax dollars your blowing into another countries battle.. Ukraine could have just swallowed their pride just as easy as russia could have not given a crap if they joined nato or not, and history dictates almost every country you see on the global stage was taken by force over another at some point in time and the us took this land from the Indians and so on and so on.. Numbers and organization of its people plays a major factor on overtaking lands. Propaganda has been a long time trusted tool of population control. There isn’t alot that happens at this stage in the game of life that’s actually something new under the sun. 

And yes the us in the past 20 years or so has sent so much of its labor and products purchasing to China in such vast quantities now China is not the little guy anymore that can just be pushed around. Us has a severe issue with trying to control Everything for everyone all over the planet. What do you call a person that try’s without thought of anything other than some strange thought that they are perfect and always show almost a desperate need and desire to control literally everything around their own life and the lives of others?.. I highly doubt that would be someone even a partially normal person would like to be close with for long.

The US fleet might not have a lot of real combat experience (except for the naval air wings), but they have a fuck load of experience with logistics. They run on logistics. Even with Taiwan so close to shore, China is still going to have to project power, which it hasn't really ever done. Certainly not in a modern era.

And of all the places to start, Taiwan is like starting a new video game in hardcore mode. That island is a fucking fortress geographically speaking. The only disadvantage it has is its proximity to mainland china (and the hundreds/thousands of ballistic missiles that are well within range).

Without Japan or China it might just be a waiting game for China in an offensive. If they're smart they'd bombard the shit out of Taiwan with long range missiles taking out anything that looks like or might be an air defense. Then go in with SEAD and take out the rest. At that point they'd have to make sure to take the time to take out as many anti-ship emplacements as they can find and hit. Only then can they even think about sending ships over to attempt a landing at one of the few landing areas they have. Even with the few landing areas not all are suitable for heavy reinforcement, though. For that you need deep water ports, which are even fewer and much more heavily defended. So if China is smart, and does everything right, it will take weeks to months of attacking Taiwan before they can even get a boot on the ground. If it goes wrong? It could turn into a wholesale slaughter of Chinese troops drowning in the Taiwan Straight having never even set foot on Taiwan.

But I truly hope it never comes to that.

&gt; 
&gt; The “end-use control” ensures that the war weapons and other military equipment stay where they should. Every decision on whether military equipment may be exported is preceded by a careful ex-ante review. All of the available information is fully scrutinised and assessed. The recipient makes a declaration confirming that exports from Germany will stay in his country.
&gt; 
&gt; If the Federal Government has doubts about the final use of the military equipment in the country of destination, it rejects export applications for that country.
&gt; 
&gt; In order to improve the controls on the end-use of war weapons and other military equipment, the federal cabinet adopted principles for “post-shipment controls” in July 2015. These measures make it possible to undertake on-the-spot controls at the recipient of the military equipment listed here. This makes it easier to detect and deter the passing on of such equipment to third parties.

I think we should do something similar, though obviously not involving the threat of a nuclear strike. Instead we should stop pussy footing around the mainland Chinese and just say, once and for all, that Taiwan is not only a separate country but they're also under the direct protection of the United States and her military. And that any attack upon Taiwan, or any invasion of Taiwan, would immediately result in a direct confrontation with all military forces of the United States.

Now do I think this will happen with all the Western balls China seems to be yanking on? Probably not, but it would end the ambiguity with Taiwan. And if history has shown us anything it's that being flexible on what you will or will not allow as far as invasions go often leads to a lot of mixed messages that end in wars (Persian Gulf War is a perfect modern example of that).",7c1033fc92fb260f8483dbee306b5b136229a61a,True,False,,,,,0,1653790889,,0,{},iadssci,False,t3_uzmksc,False,True,t1_iadntzv,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/uzmksc/big_blow_to_chinese_russian_air_force_as_their/iadssci/,1653790904,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653762089.0,

What happens is the Chinese needs stuff. They buy the Russian stuff that is or used to be high tech (especially during the Cold War). Now the Russian stuff is kinda expensive because they had to foot the bill for R&amp;D and they recoup a lot of this through sales to other nations. Well then China buys a bunch, and takes several to reverse engineer and make copies. That way they don't have to pay Russia the more expensive prices and they're also able to just make their own independently.

THEN they got a step further. They not only make these copies for themselves they also produce much cheaper versions that they then sell on the open market, undercutting Russia's asking prices by a shit load and cutting them off at the knees.

And this happens with almost everything Russia makes. Missiles? We can copy that. Planes? We can copy that. Tanks?? Yep, we can copy that. Certainly not ships? Certainly, we can copy that!

In Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, 46 per cent of its buildings had been damaged.  
  
But it is in Mariupol where the greatest proportion of damage has been identified.  
  
More than half of the buildings there have been damaged or destroyed.  
  
The true scale of the damage is likely much higher as the analysis relied on visibly incomplete building footprint data from OpenStreetMaps. Some estimates put the total damage in Mariupol closer to 95 per cent.  


For those wondering what it looks like in statistical terms - I'm surprised the number is as high as it is for Kharkov and Chernihiv. We tend to focus on Mariupol when showing damage here, so it's interesting those two cities have taken a significant beating in terms of building damage.",d67fff65ded65aac07b76855f60192758bd35a32,True,False,,,,,0,1653788234,,0,{},iado3xr,True,t3_v00sju,False,True,t3_v00sju,/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/v00sju/satellite_data_shows_how_russia_levelled/iado3xr/,1653788244,1,True,True,False,UkrainianConflict,t5_30hhs,r/UkrainianConflict,public,,0,[],,1653759434.0,

And because he is at the tip of the spear you've now put AWACS and JSTARS type sensors forward deployed through the F-35 without risking those airframe and with data feeding between them. 

To get an idea of what is possible just realize the Air Force has already proven it can put a kubernetes platform on an F-16 and that's a 50 year old design. 

The modern SIGINT aircraft are basically flying datacenters that get turned off at night. Imagine what you can do putting k8s on these airframes to run their sensor collection and targeting systems and have people on the ground pushing updates to conrainerized software every day if needed.

Basically they are operarionalizing programmers instead of waiting 5+ years for features to be deployed.

As for educating myself - cheers for phrasing it so wonderfully constructively and without making any sweeping assumptions. /s

To clarify: My frame of reference for ""doing bad stuff to Ukraine"" was the current crisis and the current German government because that's what the OP and this comment section was about. That should have been fairly clear from my responses, too. 

When it comes to previous German policy towards Russia and China, especially since 1990, as well as German's actions towards Ukraine during WW2, I think you're grossly underestimating my level of education.

Now that we've got that sorted, how about you educate yourself about German post-WW2 politics and military doctrine after WW2, as well as during and after the cold war? Or maybe you are educated about these in which case I'd ask you to stop making - against your own better judgement and education - the kind of sweeping generalisations and assumptions that can be found in your posts at such frequent rates.

*****
&gt; Aleksandr Borodai, a separatist commander and a member of the Russian Parliament, said in a phone interview that materials to treat shrapnel wounds and burns were needed &amp;quot;In great quantities&amp;quot; on the Russian side of the front.

&gt; The Russian military&amp;#039;s apparently urgent need for essential medical equipment and basic, foreign-made consumer devices has led some Russians to wonder how the Kremlin has been spending its enormous military budget, more than 3 percent of the country&amp;#039;s total economic output.

&gt; Still, the notion that Russian soldiers in Ukraine are underequipped is increasingly seeping into Russian public discourse - among both opponents and supporters of the war.
