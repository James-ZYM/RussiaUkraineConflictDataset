It's ultimately a semantic question, not a meaningful one. 

People tend to think of 'imperialism' as a bad thing, and they largely associate it with colonisation-era empires. They sensibly reject that definition of America because it doesn't have colonies in the way England did, or spread across countries like Rome.

Of course, that doesn't mean it doesn't have imperialistic tendencies, only that the way its Empire looks is different. The British Empire looked different to the Roman. It's rare that two Empires have all of the same traits - Spain, France and England all explored and 'took control' of the Americas, after all, but the methods of control differ.

In the current war, mobility is a key factor since there's a short amount of time before the enemy can lock in with counter battery radar and fire back. Towing an M777, disengaging the M777 from the truck, putting out the stabilizers, setting it up, loading the shells, firing and then packing it all up again to move takes time and a lot of muscle. The self propelled heavy artillery can move quickly to new positions, sets up in minutes, carries its own shells, and does not need roads or hard packed surfaces to drive on.

But that isn't the world we live in anymore. The Soviet Union is gone. Russia isn't already halfway accross Europe (in Eastern Germany). Now NATO extends to their borders. And they have conclusively proven that their army is no match for NATO, when back then the whole Warshaw Pact could have punched through the Fulda Gap and cause massive damage. Now they struggle against one of the poorest countries in Europe.

If they do contiue like this, they'll get destroyed, and I hope they do.

I'm pretty sure she didn't even need the notes, because she really was a good student.

This kind of thing exists in Ukraine and Belarus as well, and I imagine in other post-soviet countries. Other examples include getting people to take tests or write assignments for you, or literally bribing teachers with money or gift bags. I've heard way too many first-hand stories about education in these countries to take it seriously.

One time I took an exam in a course by a Russian teacher. We did the exam on computers in the computer lab, and we asked if we were allowed to use the internet, which was usually not allowed. He just went ""I will not check"" [whether we were using it]. It sounded weird to me at the time, but in context it makes sense, I guess he expected people to cheat and just didn't want to deal with finding out.

Ukraine, as the defending country, has much stronger morale than Russia which means that they'll continue to fight. And as long as they continue to fight, I believe the outcome will be a protracted stalemate in the worst case.

On a macro level this seems to be a war of logistics and intelligence, and regarding these two factors Ukraine has the majority of the developed world behind its back. Russia has many resources but at the end of the day it is only one country.

Russia does have a manpower advantage but I'm not sure how relevant this is. We can look to previous conflicts such as Russia's stumble in Syria and guess that it might not be so critical.

Regarding intelligence specifically, some of the stuff the NSA alone does is scary, and I physically shutter when I think about the combined intelligence forces of all NATO countries sitting in a war-room somewhere.

I would like to say that Poland did have its problems and undoubtedly some bad behavior instances did probably  happen .... but to brand the whole country Nazi....

There are a few misconceptions...if you look at the historical map, lets say pre 1300 wasn't it the Lithuanians that covered those vast territories it wasn't just Poland, correct? Hence the name Polish-Lithuanian union. In that case you should look up that same wikipedia and look up the Blood Lines of Wladyslaw ""Jogaila"" and than his child wife and her parents plans and you might get the reasons for partition of Poland. 

Secondly if you study Polish history of those times and till 1700's you would find out that there were many famous and regular jews, muslims and people of all cultures and countries which would make Poland an attractive place for many, not because of oppression but acceptance and freedom of expression.

I can not say it these reports are true or just Russian propaganda but the narrative Zelensky had in public and pushing laws that legalize execution of routing troops by military officers are also a hint in that direction. But it may be influence of rigth wing hawks. Churchill and FDR were the people who authorized large scale military ops like landing in Normandy, but of course they did not go into details.

In the Helicopter as a pilot/co-pilot they have a form of overlay on the dashboard/controls which shows their diagonal angle in meters. So an extra 100-150 meters for the rocket to land would be, say; 3-5 meters nose up; they add that to the elevation they fly at and work out how far the rockets should land.


These rocket pods are similar to katyusha rocket systems which are fairly short range and inaccurate. So an attack helicopter must fly low, fire and re-maneuver or as seen they fly low, increase elevation, fire and retreat. (Big body aircraft increase elevation, fire and reatreat; maneuverable attack helicopters like the Hind can stay engaged because they have a 30mm support gun so they have a smaller chance of small arms contact after a rocket barrage: theoretically)


The rocket pods really are a direct short ranged artillery strike, perfect for air mobilization/paratrooper or other ground units who require the support of artillery but at a moments notice.


Russian derived aircraft do have air to ground missile systems which are more-so reserved for maneuverable aircraft such as the 'KA' series and the Hind. So anything alike to our hellfire missiles would be strapped to those aircraft.


The MI-8 (Big body aircraft) can fit 2x the rocket pods a Hind or a KA-52 could which is why its utilized as an artillery fortress on the battlefield, they lob their rockets; return to base, re-arm and return. If the battlefield is controlled they can easily get up closer and demolish entrenched positions with dead-on accuracy (up to 100-250 meters; guessing)


They do get reticles for their rocket pods for Close-air support but sometimes they just use general direction, utilize their elevation/gyro display and do the math; it exponentially minimizes the risk for slow moving aircraft on the battlefield.


There are also different rocket pods; the B8 V20-A (S-8 rocket, 20 rockets) or the UB-32's (S-5 rocket, 32 rockets) and of course smaller versions of the UB series.",e2d3d5350992a31784aefc2188f2fb7340a3f1b0,True,False,,,,,0,1653809170,,0,{},iaeiz03,False,t3_v028jc,False,True,t1_iae2ehb,/r/UkraineWarVideoReport/comments/v028jc/welcome_sight_a_lowflying_ukrainian_helicopter/iaeiz03/,1653809183,1,True,True,False,UkraineWarVideoReport,t5_5wjmo8,r/UkraineWarVideoReport,public,,0,[],,1653780370.0,

Ukraine should blow up those pipelines. Russia is getting over a billion dollars a day in income from them.

German bankers are playing the Euro is the better dollar game again. That is why Sadaam's regime in Iraq was destroyed. Germany is still trying to take over the world by proxy. Russia is almost certainly a secret ally of the German Financiers power bloc. Germany wanted Ukraine in Russian hands.

France was with the Germans because they also prefer a stronger Euro and voiding the US dollar default global currency. That is why France begs for Ukraine to bend over for Putin.

US can keep printing money as long as they keep the world hooked on US dollars. It causes an inflation tax on the world but that is normal.

Ukraine gets as many billions as they need as long as Russia is beaten. Germany is also getting beaten. France is just checking if it is time to surrender yet. The French actually have a conscience and are happy with Ukraine getting freedom and justice.  Germany is bullying them to try and stay with them.
