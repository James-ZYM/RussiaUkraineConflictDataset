Relevant part:
&gt; The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of
Genocide (""Genocide Convention"") defines genocide as ""[k]illing members
of the group"" that is ""committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a
national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such."""" This definition has reached the status of a customary norm under international law, and is
universally accepted by virtually all international law actors.
&gt;
&gt; Undoubtedly, the Katyn massacre constituted a ""killing"" of
""members of the group"" (the Poles). However, the mens rea requirement,
represented by the phrase ""intent to destroy"" a group ""as such"" may be
more problematic to fulfill. The Soviets certainly had the intent to destroy a
part of the Polish national group. However, the subgroup that they targeted
(the Polish intelligentsia) is not defined under the Genocide Convention,
which only contemplates the destruction of ""national, ethnic, racial or
religious"" groups ""as such.""""
&gt;
&gt; The situation is similar to that of Cambodia in the late 1970s, during
the Khmer Rouge regime. The Khmer Rouge, like Stalin, endeavored to
destroy the Cambodian elites and intelligentsia in a quest to rid the
Cambodian society of any potentially dissenting elements.9 1 While some
scholars have argued that the Khmer leadership committed genocide toward
its own population, others have claimed that the Khmer crimes do not
amount to genocide because their intent was simply to destroy a part of the
Cambodian population that cannot be described as one of the ""protected""
groups under the Genocide Convention.9 2 Thus, under a stricto sensu,
technical reading of the Convention, neither Stalin nor Pol Pot, the Khmer
Rouge leader, committed genocide: each merely intended to destroy a part
of a national group, unprotected by the drafters of the Genocide Convention.
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has confirmed the need to interpret
the Convention strictly in a recent ruling involving a lawsuit by Bosnia and
Herzegovina against Serbia for the latter's involvement and alleged
genocide in Bosnia during the Yugoslav civil war in the early 1990s.93 The
ICJ ruled that the Serbs lacked the specific ""intent"" to destroy a group in
Bosnia, with respect to some of the atrocities committed in the territory of he latter.9 4 The narrow reading of the Genocide Convention, although
unpopular with victims' rights groups and many scholars,"" has been
embraced by the World Court and remains of invaluable legal authority.
&gt;
&gt; One could argue, however, that the Katyn killings did constitute
genocide under a less technical reading of the Genocide Convention. The
Soviets intended to destroy a ""part"" of the Polish national group."" It does
not matter -that the Convention does not specifically enumerate the
subgroup, as the listing of protected groups in Article II should not be read
as exhaustive. In other words, the Convention drafters certainly intended for
the treaty to cover crimes such as Katyn or the Khmer Rouge killings in
Cambodia."" The drafters must have wanted for such rogue leaders as Stalin
or Pol Pot to face criminal responsibility. One should not use a technical
reading of the Genocide Convention to absolve potential criminals of
responsibility or to deny justice to victims of horrific atrocities. As many
scholars have argued with respect to the situation in Cambodia,"" the Katyn
crimes could be interpreted as constituting genocide under a less narrow
reading and interpretation of the Genocide Convention.",5cb330b1ae10f0f757530d46a256d07046189efa,True,False,,,,,0,1653862714,,0,{},iah6g7l,False,t3_v09pc3,False,True,t1_iah2gyj,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v09pc3/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_29_2022/iah6g7l/,1653862726,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653833914.0

[],False,,ProletarianRevolt,,,[],,,,text,t2_2t3bq2l3,False,False,"The term great power is highly subjective, but personally my conception of a great power is that it has: 1) the ability to project conventional power outside of its own immediate region; 2) has enough military, economic, and technological capacity to compel other great powers to cooperate with or adapt to its fundamental interests to a significant extent; 3) has at least a regional sphere of influence; 4) is capable, to a significant extent, of shaping political outcomes within its sphere of influence; 5) has its own independent foreign and domestic policy and is not subservient to or acting as the agent of a greater power. 

In this formulation Russia is probably somewhere in between a regional power and a great power, leaning towards great power status. It does have the ability to project conventional power outside of its own region (the intervention in Syria being a prime example), but its overall capacity to do so is very limited compared to the USA or (soon) China. It’s not solely a regional power but I definitely would not call them a global power.

It does have the ability to compel other great powers to adapt to its fundamental interests to a certain extent, for instance keeping the US and western powers out of the war in Ukraine instead of directly intervening like they did in the 1st Gulf War or Yugoslav wars. However it’s nowhere near the capability of the Soviet Union in this regard, you can see the difference in how the US and Western Europe reacted to the Soviet Union’s various military interventions in Eastern Europe compared to Russia’s intervention in Ukraine. We can also see modern Russia’s weakness in this regard in its inability to prevent eastward NATO expansion in the last period. 

Russia does have a regional sphere of influence: Belarus, (sort of) Ukraine, and much of Central Asia. Basically all the CSTO countries. Its influence in Syria is extensive but there are other powers that have equal or greater influence there, such as Iran.

It is capable to a pretty significant extent in shaping political outcomes within its sphere of influence, we only have to look to the recent Russian interventions in Belarus and Kazakhstan to see that Russia is generally capable of preventing unfriendly regimes from coming to power (with the notable exception of post-Maidan Ukraine).

Finally, Russia definitely has its own independent foreign and domestic policy. The lack of an independent foreign policy is why I don’t consider the UK or France to be great powers, but rather satellite powers of the United States. In my opinion, great power status has as much to do with political factors as it does with military, economic, and technological factors. Without a strong economy or military a country cannot be a great power, but a strong country that only acts with the permission of or at the behest of a stronger power is not a great power in its own right.",e5a0b0fe0a7f9dc851ac6311ca5b09dfa2b154c4,True,False,,,,,0,1653848814,,0,{},iagdlks,False,t3_v09pc3,False,True,t1_iag1f9l,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v09pc3/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_29_2022/iagdlks/,1653848831,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653820014.0

2) I would think that a quality separate NCO organization insulates against single points of incompetence unless it’s at the general level. 

3) one concept this won’t test given its ww2 is ‘objective function of the organization’. Ww2 was an existential struggle. Modern militaries can mission creep away from being good at wars (and many have a regime stability or graft primary function). Would imagine that alone is very predictive if it can be measured.

But this is a hard problem due to limited observations and how many variables are involved so I understand why they are focusing on leadership quality inside ww2 only.",a093296a89f902e6193b14321754d1d685967644,True,False,,,,,0,1653847960,,0,{},iagbrkm,False,t3_uyxyp1,False,False,t3_uyxyp1,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uyxyp1/leadership_and_military_effectiveness_this/iagbrkm/,1653847976,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653819160.0

There is no lend-lease program for Ukraine, never has been, never will be. The so-called ""new lend-lease act,"" or more correctly ""Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022,"" does not institute any specifc new program.

&gt; The administration also urged Taiwan in a separate letter dated March 22 to consider buying an upgraded mobile artillery system, the self-propelled M109A7 Paladin, instead of the older version Taipei requested in 2020. In the letter, Erik Uribe, the Army’s regional desk officer for security cooperation integration and exports, warned of delays in delivery of the A6s due to “known obsolescence issues.” State’s suggestion that Taiwan buy a different gun has not been reported.

&gt; The Army itself is retiring the older artillery in favor of the A7 version, Uribe wrote.

&gt; “Opting for the A7 would align Taiwan’s indirect fires capabilities with the U.S. Army’s, leading to cost-saving, interoperability, and production capacity benefits,” Uribe wrote. Further, the Army estimates the annual operating cost for one A7 to be $250,000 less than for the A6.

There has been a lot of speculation about what is going on in the heads of world leaders lately. So I went looking for some way to understand how the experts do it. This paper from 2020 goes into how this has been done in the past and the difficulties in doing it well. The anecdotes of prominent leaders and points of history was fascinating, I did not put them all in as it would have made for a really big section of quotes, and I am not sure how many people are reading those anyway.

What surprised me most was the wild swings in prominence and acceptance of this field. At one point it was the largest part of the CIA, if you look at the number of publications. Today it is a small fraction of that size. And although it can be seen as helpful to some leaders, others see the assessments as not useful at all, or even harmful. 

One of the big take aways to me was that listening to what world leaders say is actually a good way to know what they are thinking. Annoyingly simplistic perhaps, but it does seem to me that not enough people paid attention to Putin when he was openly declaring his intentions and world view. 

------------------

&gt; * Little public domain literature on the leader analysis function exists, and so this is a “first cut” at the problem. It is intended to identify some of the dynamics and history of the practice, rather than an attempt to develop and test a comprehensive theory of intelligence analysis and policymaking in this area. 

&gt; * Some documentation has been declassified, and we were able to secure very valuable interviews with policymakers and analysts. 

&gt; * The health of Soviet leaders was always a high priority during the Cold War as, nowadays, are assessments of the mental stability of leaders who could ignite a nuclear war.21 

&gt; * In 1986 there was a further consolidation of leader assessment elements into a new Office of Leadership Analysis (LDA)… LDA quickly became the busiest office in CIA: a 1986 Directorate of Intelligence document shows that LDA produced more than twice as many reports as all of the regional offices combined. 

&gt; * We find a paradox: while senior clients retain a deep interest in receiving leader analyses, they are also often critical of them when they arrive (in contrast to mid-level and junior policymakers, who are more likely to form an ongoing relationship with intelligence analysts and find their leader analysis products useful). A major factor driving these criticisms is that senior policymakers often have the personal opportunity to test leader assessments when they meet top foreign leaders.33 This stark fact makes the intelligence–policy cycle in the area of leadership assessments somewhat unique. 

&gt; * Former State Department officials told us that they would find useful (although did not often receive) information and analysis that could suggest opportunities for providing them leverage in a negotiation or dialog. For example, if they knew a given leader was feeling pressure from some domestic or financial angle, even if unrelated to the subject at hand, it could provide an opportunity to shape a favorable outcome.45 

&gt; * …a former senior official told us that the use of intelligence information about foreign leaders to “jack them up” was not part of this official’s repertoire, as the risks of being exposed as a dirty negotiator were too great.47 

&gt; * Prediction and leverage are often overly ambitious goals then. 

&gt; * Hadley told us that one way to understand what a foreign leader was thinking about the United States was to understand the briefings they were getting from their own system. The United States judged that what President Putin was getting from his system was mostly bad information leading to incorrect conclusions. If U.S. decisionmakers had assumed Putin was acting rationally on the basis of perfect information, they would not have understood what he was doing. 

&gt; * In general, our interviewees thought too much prestige was placed on information obtained through clandestine means. 

&gt; * Although the common assumption is that political leaders, especially dictators, speak insincerely in public, this is often not the case. 

&gt; * The senior policymakers we interviewed had significant criticisms of leader profiling when it goes beyond the basic biographic data. Two sins were repeatedly mentioned: that the leader assessment is wrong, making predictions or assigning characteristics that are subsequently shown to be incorrect; or (more often) that the leader assessment is anodyne, saying little of value about the subject of the assessment. 

&gt; * Most difficult to guard against, the foreign leader might simply change over time in ways that are apparent only after the fact. Stephen Hadley told us the last problem was the hardest to deal with, for both policymakers and intelligence analysts. The Bush administration experienced this with Russian President Putin, whom they initially read as a potential reformer. “Putin changed” after the color revolutions in Central and Eastern Europe, Hadley told us. 

&gt; * While some of our interviewees expressed frustration that the common fact- heavy two-page leader profiles offered little more than a list of dates and places, others preferred that approach, and reacted with alarm when analysts went beyond biography into assessments of personality and worldview. 

&gt; * There are some intractable barriers to objective and reliable leader assessment—most basically, that the inscrutability of the minds of others is a fundamental feature of human interaction. 

&gt; * Further, as with all long-standing organizational practices, there is a reason why policymakers and analysts behave in the way that they do, and changing practice to solve some problems will inevitably lead to other, different problems.88 

&gt; * Finally, like all intelligence, the utility of the product is highly dependent on the reader—a perfect leader assessment will have no influence if policymakers ignore it. Most of the problems in this area happen at the presidential or cabinet level, where highly confident and senior figures have access to privileged information about foreign leaders, and (often justifiably) believe they can think themselves in to the head of a senior counterpart more effectively than an intelligence analyst.

Previously, I was wondering if the Ukrainians were going to retreat over the river after some time, but it seems like they’re trying to make a concerted stand there. Russian artillery should be outgunning them but I believe one (analyst) Philips OBrien thinks that the Russians might be running low on armored vehicles on the region.

Not too sure about that. He states it might be as Russia seemingly isn’t trying for a full encirclement and just going for an assault. But with the massed artillery, I think that it’s still likely the Russians are content to sit back and bomb if they can because urban warfare is a nightmare.

Very unclear based on missing info. Ukrainians have also taken severe losses in the area so maybe the Russians think they’re close to breaking or something. Maybe it’s pure desperation.

Have to keep an eye on how things progress from here. My guess is if Russia stops probing attacks and clenches down into a hard strike, they’re either found a point to go hard, which might convince the Ukrainians to pull back across. Or they might be gassed out.

Also have to see what is about to happen in the Kherson front. Might cause unit shifts too.

Again, I don’t understand the long term thinking here. They need to have a dense enough concentration of units in the regions they hold to keep them. Right now, from what I’ve been hearing, it sounds they pulled everything they had left to try and take Severodonestk. 

Maybe some things is still obfuscated, but more and more, I think that they really should have called up more units or started defensive actions much earlier.",62c37abdaf653d029ad534199b76533a6d3a6663,True,False,,,,,0,1653831153,,0,{},iafbck6,False,t3_v09pc3,False,True,t1_iaf7anj,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v09pc3/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_29_2022/iafbck6/,1653831172,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653802353.0

The current strategy of supplying weapons but not soldiers is well within the level of conflict managed during the cold war.

[],False,,cs_Thor,,,[],,,,text,t2_pekib,False,False,"&gt; I'm going respectfully disagree... in that I think it's not so much that people in education specifically are against the Bundeswehr, as much as German society overall is pretty neutral towards the Bundeswehr. Unlike in many Anglo countries, joining the Bundeswehr doesn't carry positive social prestige, and it exists in the context of a very wealthy country so it must compete with private industry for people, and of course it must deal with the baggage of Germany's past. I work alot in academia – so yeah, my university colleagues are not fans of the Bundeswehr, but more telling, is that my older working-class inlaws are also not fans, and other working-class family members are also not huge fans and would probably advise a young person against joining, etc., and these are not all ""hippy"" people or ""far left"" by any means. In other countries these would be the strongest supporters, but here they feel very so-la-la about it.

That doesn't contradict what I was saying. The demographics in Germany that goes for a teaching job (and I was more talking about elementary school up to grammar school than university) - it's female, has left-leaning political views and is in general critical of the military as a matter of ideological distance. That doesn't invalidate your diagnosis of societal distance and neutrality - it actually validates it. Both factors have influence on the non-relationship between society and Bundeswehr - the society is distant and produces people inherently skeptical, some of which become teachers ... and so on.

&gt; The Bundeswehr itself also has problems – while former conscripts might have fond memories of time with friends it's pretty common to hear that overall their time with the Bund was kinda demeaning and a ""waste of time"", its well known that the organization is incredibly bureaucratic and inefficient, and it has been plagued since its origins with frequent right-wing extremist scandals at all levels – which are particularly damaging given the historical context.

Which, if we're honest, would describe pretty much any military. In Germany, as you said, the historical context makes all of that even more sensitive and prone to scandalization.

&gt; Probably the Bundeswehr needs to transform itself – to become more flexible and integrated into the lives of modern Germans (i.e. more part-time work, more flexible roles, more modern jobs and equipment – there are lots of countries which have experimented with changing enrollment offers/offers for reserve troops), and organizationally so that it can act as a more attractive options for young people – the Israeli army in one aspect might be a model, where it's different units serve as prestigious finishing schools for youth, but right now the best young German students would 100% pick a German university over service time.

That is far easier said than done. Bottom line I don't think Israel can serve as a model here as the societal views and fundament is wholly different, the society actually stands firmly behind Tsahal unlike in Germany. That is a massive factor that cannot be ""reformed away"" and will remain the main stumbling stone no matter what Berlin does (or doesn't do).",0c6c4213df57e7a214985d49185030495be01605,True,False,,,,,0,1653829919,,0,{},iaf911j,False,t3_uzgjke,False,True,t1_iaf3n19,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uzgjke/the_hundred_billion_euro_man_olaf_scholz_and/iaf911j/,1653829933,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653801119.0

The Bundeswehr itself also has problems – while former conscripts might have fond memories of time with friends it's pretty common to hear that overall their time with the Bund was kinda demeaning and a ""waste of time"", its well known that the organization is incredibly bureaucratic and inefficient, and it has been plagued since its origins with frequent right-wing extremist scandals at all levels – which are particularly damaging given the historical context. 

Probably the Bundeswehr needs to transform itself – to become more flexible and integrated into the lives of modern Germans (i.e. more part-time work, more flexible roles, more modern jobs and equipment – there are lots of countries which have experimented with changing enrollment offers/offers for reserve troops), and organizationally so that it can act as a more attractive options for young people – the Israeli army in one aspect might be a model, where it's different units serve as prestigious finishing schools for youth, but right now the best young German students would 100% pick a German university over service time.",714c5cb3f0f48e35a961cea2bb055d9a36d92841,True,False,,,,,0,1653826700,,0,{},iaf3n19,False,t3_uzgjke,False,True,t1_iaedzzz,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uzgjke/the_hundred_billion_euro_man_olaf_scholz_and/iaf3n19/,1653826715,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653797900.0

Consider that to become a proper wall painter in Germany you do a formal apprenticeship and get a certificate – and then when that ""master painter"" does their job, they do so with very high skill and finish. On one hand it's painting a wall – in other countries that's a job for students during their school holidays – but in Germany that task can be done extremely well if you want (although at a high price, with the overhead being the person's training, tools, etc.).

The cost of this precision, and Germany's highly specialized and divided education system, is that it lacks flexibility. Changing careers is hard, and changing the way that work is done is hard – there's resistance at liberalizing rules because it would be both unfair and also potentially impact quality. This is changing, but Germany's economy is still mostly propped up by the old German manufacturing giants, and small-middle companies (the famous ""Mittelstand"") which are not super forward thinking – so it's not happening with urgency even if it probably should. 

Anyways – that's a more micro individual level... but I guess you can see the cultural basis which would favour a slow-moving bureaucracy at the macro level, but there are also definitely policy reasons by governments over the last several decades, which entrenched and expanded this bureaucracy further.

I'm very skeptical. I've lived in a country that has a 'reformed' bureaucracy (the UK), and it does not result in less bureaucracy. It simply results in a bureaucracy that is really disorganized. 

In contrast, Germany's bureaucracy is capable of attracting talented people and retaining them. Interacting with them is about as rational and painless as interacting with bureaucrats can be.

There are aspects of the German system that are notably bureaucratic and sprawling (the health system) but that's largely a result of a messy incrementalist hybrid of private and public.

Anglo-saxons tend to look at basically any bureacracy and say 'it's bloated', because the UK, and the US, essentially favour small states with light-touch regulation. However, historically, the success stories of the 20th century are countries that have had directed development, with industry working hand-in-hand with bureaucracy. Japan, China, SK, and Germany all follow this model, and it works because stable bureaucracies with long term employees can pursue strategic goals.",ea5d08cf4e4212740d39a4e58881fbeeadfe5f0d,True,False,,,,,0,1653825465,,0,{},iaf1uho,False,t3_uzgjke,False,True,t1_iac0t82,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uzgjke/the_hundred_billion_euro_man_olaf_scholz_and/iaf1uho/,1653825481,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1653796665.0

[],False,,robothistorian,,,[],,,,text,t2_2inubrvw,False,False,"&gt;There will be more crises like Ukraine that pull in great powers, spark escalation risks based on fear and uncertainty, and test the viability of integrated deterrence.

The Ukraine crisis is a creation of the great powers though that reality is lost in the media blitz surrounding this war. The war games did not (or maybe they did but it has not been made public) study how provoking great powers leads to crises like the one in Ukraine. Further, it has also not been explained (or studies) how and to what extent can great powers provoke each other while maintaining control over escalation and within the envelope of ""integrated deterrence"".

&gt;The longer a conflict such as Ukraine lasts, the less likely it will be confined to one state.

This is pure speculation. It also assumes the rationality of one actor or a group of actors and the irrationality of the opposing actor or group of actors.  It presumes that the aggressor (in this instance Russia) would arbitrarily expand the scope of the war to target other NATO countries (for example, the surgical strike on NATO logistical bases). The question stands that if Russia would eventually - after almost 30% or more of its war-waging ability has been degraded - expand the scope of the war by attacking NAto countries and facilities directly, then why did it not attack Ukraine overwhelmingly, that is to say, why fight in Ukraine in terms of what it refers to as a ""limited military operation""? Why not launch an all out conventional attack on Ukraine, which it clearly did not do. A possible subtext of this point about escalation could be a test to see how and to what extent can a great power be provoked to widen the scope of war thereby coalescing a larger and more global alliance against it (in effect neutralizing the PRC and compelling countries like India to openly take a stand against Russia).

&gt;The national security community will need to develop tools and techniques for assessing competition, escalation tendencies, and risk attitudes among foreign leaders that combine old concepts from political psychology with new capabilities afforded by data science and natural language processing.

Lol! This is funny! Using NLP and data science to ""read"" non-Western cultural mindsets!! Just goes to show how blinkered this perspective is. While there is always a need to come up with new techniques and models by which to assess foreign adversaries, one should begin by actually learning the culture and language and to understand that they need not make sense of the world in the same way as you do.

With specific reference to the last point - perhaps  the author(s) of this report would be better served by closely looking at the findings (and subsequent methodologies) of analysts like Konrad Kellen. Thus for example...

&gt;[Leon] Goure took those analyses and he gave briefings to all the top military brass in the American military establishment. And every time he gave a presentation on the Vietnam Motivation and Morale Project, he said the same things:

that the Vietcong were utterly demoralisedthat they were about to give upthat if pushed a little bit more, if bombed just a little bit more, they'll throw up their hands in despair and run screaming back to Hanoi

It's hard to overestimate just how seriously Goure was taken in those years. He was the only man who understood the mind of the enemy. When dignitaries came to Saigon, their first stop would be the villa in Rue Pasteur, where Goure would hold forth at cocktail parties with insights into this strange, mysterious enemy they were fighting.

He'd be picked up by helicopter and whisked to aircraft carriers off the coast of Vietnam, so he could brief the top military brass who had flown in from Washington. They used to say that Lyndon Johnson would walk around with a copy of Goure's findings in his back pocket. What Goure said formed the justification for US policy in Vietnam.

Everyone believed what Goure said, with one exception - Konrad Kellen. He read the same interviews and reached the exact opposite conclusion.

Years later, he would say that his rethinking began with one memorable interview with a senior Vietcong captain. He was asked very early in the interview if he thought the Vietcong could win the war, and he said no.

But pages later, he was asked if he thought that the US could win the war, and he said no.

The second answer profoundly changes the meaning of the first. He didn't think in terms of winning or losing at all, which is a very different proposition. An enemy who is indifferent to the outcome of a battle is the most dangerous enemy of all.

[],False,,BeondTheGrave,,,[],,,,text,t2_4zro2,False,False,"Im not an economist but my reading of the situation is:

Currently things are not great, there are limitations on the goods and services that Russia has access to. BUT its uncomfortable and people there *are noticing* the real cost of sanctions. In the short term the Russian government can use its war chest of funds, supplemented by discounted oil sales, to keep the economy afloat. So not much danger in the short term. But in the medium and long term Russia is in a bad bad place. Medium term, Russia is currently only afloat economically thanks to state spending. How long that holds out is anyone's guess, months maybe, but eventually the cash is going to run out. And at that point the cost will really bite. Take agriculture, Russia grows and exports way more food than it needs. So what happens to those farmers if they dont get paid for last years food (most food waiting to be sold is from last harvest, and is literally a sunk cost. They paid to grow it and need the cash to plant for next season.) Right now the government can buy that food, redistribute it or burn it or sell it abroad if someone will buy it. But when the cash runs out? Or oil. Russia is selling its oil at near or sub break even for them, they have a very high cost to produce. So basically the industry went from about five years of low profits thanks to a trade war with the Saudis, to the Covid price crash, to this embargo. At least theyre getting *something* but who knows in what quantity and for how long. What happens when things break? Or when new wells need to be opened up. If that cash is being diverted for short term price controls, what happens when its time for reinvestment (and also when Russia is locked out of international finance). 

Long term things are probably bleak for Russia. Without serious reforms theyll be seen as a bit of a pariah state. Maybe France will sell them a few thermal sights for their tanks, or Germany will buy gas and other raw resources. But nobody is going to make a long term parts contract with Russia. Or invest in a new plant in Moscow. Why would you, it makes your company &amp; country look bad dealing with the Butchers of Bucha. Or think about high skill tech workers, would you rather work in a dingy basement in St. Petersburg making weird horror games and dodging the draft, or move to Huston and make weird horror games, make 4x the pay, and not have to do the army bit? And of course the white elephant: High oil prices are good for oil producers in the short term, but there are a plethora of alternative technologies now available. LNG and ICE is purely a economics choice now, not technology. Solar, Wind, Tidal, and Nuclear power (hell even coal, doesn't have to be green) all offer strong alternatives to Russian LNG, and of course electric cars to Russian crude. The world just doesn't need Russian oil like it used to, and the politics of much of western Europe is so anti-Petrol to begin with that they dont need much of an excuse to kick it out. LNG is important in some industrial processes, and so Germany remains addicted. But even that is just some investment and regulation away from going away. So without oil sales where does that leave Russia?

There are at a minimum enough officers of sufficient longevity that they serve as an institutional memory and as a skeletal structure upon which a larger military force of new entrants- volunteers or conscripts- can be added. 

Better professional militaries, at least in the Western tradition, extend these principles of long service and priority of military needs to their NCO classes.

&gt;Their achievement was already pioneered and surpassed by the post-WW2 governments in Japan, Korea (South, obviously), Taiwan, and Singapore

I'm curious, In what way is this true? 

If it involves political considerations, then I suppose I can't contest it in a productive way, or even in good faith - as it's frankly just not my place to attack your own \*personal\* values.

However, if we *are* trying to be productive, then by practically every single metric I can think of, China has obviously and exponentially exceeded the counties in your list. I don't even think I need to waste the time typing out a more extensive explanation, as even the most vehemently opponents of the PRC can still pretty much acknowledge that they've quite surpassed those nations. 

Japan and South Korea indeed followed notably similar models to the one China ended up following - but to say China's case is no different to the rest of the bunch is pretty near-sighted in my opinion. In Japan's case, it was practically deluged with funding, jobs, and other aid with the goal of building JP into a strong regional partner and an effective ""first line of defense"" against Soviet and Chinese forces in the Pacific. South Korea enjoyed not quite as much, but still an easily worth acknowledgement amount of aid in their own right. While both nations did indeed go through a similar phase of low-skill industrialization, leading to a boom in economic productivity; this is in no way shape or form implies that those other nations ""trail-blazed"" such a growth model, while all China did was just stumble down the \[canceled\] brick road to profit. 

After all, how did the US ascend to superpower status again? How did the entire European continent transition from Agrarian to Urban? Indeed, by industrializing. It's not that SK and JP forged a path that China followed, it's that the path has always been there, for every single nation, and of the ones you listed - China has been able to squeeze the most out of what walking such a path provides. 

Industrialization brings Urbanization brings Liberalization brings Globalization. This is simply the natural path of human societal development and population distribution; and it's true pretty much everywhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Westerners who attempt at a more ""nuanced"" view of their adversaries never actually get it right, and often run dangerously close to ""going native"". 

  
Wow haha, that's crazy. I'm sure it's not like understanding an adversary helps with accurate decision making on topics related to them or anything, right? Surely, when dealing with an entity you may be forced to fight some time in the not-too-distant-future; silly attempts to gain as complete a picture as possible of them is useless and stupid. Wouldn't want to risk to risk agreeing with them!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;your societies have been (generally) free and prosperous for too long, and you can never understand the warped worldview that an unfree society can produce. 

  
What a patently ridiculous way to view someone you haven't a clue about. Perhaps this is just the fundamental diverging-point between us: I really really   wanna know. No matter what it is, I want to ***know***. To butcher my own core principal: I consider nothing else to be so purely ""good"" as knowledge -  and thus trying to slurp up as much of it as we can is naturally what I view to be the most admirable endeavor most of us can or will partake in. I understand that it's a fairly odd set of principles, and I feel like a total goober laying it out like that, but I find it important to communicate how core it is to who I am as a person, because clearly your own set of beliefs beliefs about wanting to know don't look anything *near* my own.  I guess if you're the sort that prefers convincing yourself you know better than I do about where I've lived, the life I've led, and the things I've experienced - then perhaps I'm being unfair to expect you to naturally seek information so that you can develop a genuine informed opinion.  


&gt;And here you are, thinking that a generally positive view of the CCP held by the Chinese is anything other than a carefully manicured public consensus, largely generated and imposed by the top, ""manufactured consent"" style.

You know what? You're right. You got me. I've been brainwashed by \[insert your rival political party here\] media into thinking Xi Jinping literally built Glorious China with his own two hands. Surely there's no conceivable way in which my own professional competence resting in no small part on my ability to step into the PRC's shoes and consider what the best course of action is for them, could POSSIBLY mean I routinely engage in that sort of thought process without it having anything to do with my own personal beliefs. Indeed, it's just not possible that upon seeing this sort of thing, you would leap to the assumption that I hold them in fonder view than is actually the case.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;PS. You started warming up to the CCP in the last 5\~6 years? That's a very weird coincidence, considering that Xi has been taking the party to ideological extremes completely incompatible with universal concepts of human rights or freedom during that time.

&amp;#x200B;

Damn haha yeah I agree, that would be a coincidence. I guess it's a good thing it's not the fucking case then wouldn't you say? 

If you are a Westerner, you are better off just mindlessly hating the CCP, like you did before. You will be nearer the truth that way.

*This* is where you've outright destroyed any and all *trace* of respect I had for you. I don't mean it in the context of this discussion, nor limited to whatever batshit schizophrenic brainrot you're trying to pass off as a """"""position"""""" on the subject matter. Things go a tad further in this case. Due not only to the incessant, derisive  bullshit found in every single vapid paragraph, and moreover, the hypocrisy of conducting yourself in such a manner while ***being*** a prime example of the mindlessness you implore. I mean, the sheer lack of *sentience* required not to - for even one brief moment - just ***think*** ***critically*** about your inane conclusions, baffles me. However, those are all follow-on effects from what *really* set you apart as an oxygen thief among oxygen thieves; the demand to stop thinking. It's due to *that* singularly ***evil*** notion, that I ought to - in ***any*** conceivable reality - *stop* thinking, that I legitimately no longer consider you as a ""human."" To stop thinking is basically just to die. That's not hyperbole either, you literally may as well just stop breathing too, because if you've stopped thinking, you are no different from a corpse. While I'm entirely willing to engage with a thinking, cognizant, *human being -* even one as moronic and ill-natured as you were acting*;* I have exactly ***zero*** desire to engage with a glorified non-living  lump of biomass, hormones, and wasted oxygen.. *That* is the end result of not thinking: you become nothing more than a meat-puppet being steered around haphazardly by whatever neurotransmitter happens to splash around at the time.

Some sort of military operation is going on, against Nazi-junkies of Ukraine, but the real Ukrainians, the silent and subjugated majority of little russians will obviously understand that our intentions were noble. Bucha, Irpin etc were obviously staged.

Anything north of that line is in the Joint War Committee listed areas and is subject to ""special negotiation"" which probably means huge prices.

Early in the war Russia hit three commercial ships: Namura Queen, Millennial Spirit and Yasa Jupiter.
