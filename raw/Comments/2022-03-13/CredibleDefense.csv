9,[],False,,TikiTDO,,,[],,,,text,t2_3yp3u,False,False,"Consider, what exactly is corruption? It's when the resources intended for Goal A are instead going into the pockets of Person B. If you accept that the more resources you direct towards a problem the more likely a problem is to be solved, then you should see the problem. Corruption will inherently lead to less effective use of resources. This isn't a matter of ideological differences, it's basic cause-and-effect. If I spend $1 million on a problem, and you spent $500k on a problem, and pocket $500k for yourself, then I'm likely to have a much better resolution to my problem than you are. Sure, you'll end up with more money in your pocket than me, but you will be in a worse state long term, because you will not be able to solve your problem nearly as well as I did. The net result of these actions is that I'm going to have an easier time building trust and finding additional investments.

The above statement is as true in a western liberal democracy as it is in a brutal totalitarian dictatorship or a traditional monarchy. Simply, corruption inherently makes your country less effective at accomplishing it's goals, because it reduces the amount of resources that go towards solving said goal.

This brings us to another point. Military force is generally the last strategy a country can use to accomplish it's goals. This is the solution that is only used when all other avenues of approach have failed. Taking these two points together, it's not that the more corrupt party is always the aggressor, it's that the more corrupt party has less options to exhaust (due to less resources going towards any given task), thus a more corrupt nation is more likely to resort to military action sooner, because they will not have nearly as many solutions open to them as a less corrupt country.

Whether the countries Russia takes an interest in are more corrupt does not matter. Russia takes an interest in *weaker* countries (specifically, ones with less economic resources, with less political alliances) regardless of their level of corruption. If the leadership in Russia feel like they can get away with taking what belongs to someone else... Well, that too is the corruption mindset at play. However, this limit's Russia's potential pool of targets, because an economically stronger, and politically well connected nation is much more likely to lead to an escalation they are not ready for.

Incidentally, less corrupt countries also have an easier time gaining economic and political might. It's a lot easier to get financial investments and alliances when you have a higher degree of trust. Most investors want to ensure their money will yield returns, while most politicians want to ensure that their political maneuvering will be reciprocated.",9661458f3304057da42dffb52d31d50982ebca99,True,False,,,,,0,1647214956,,0,{},i0jy8yx,False,t3_tbx9bb,False,True,t1_i0jghu7,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tbx9bb/russian_military_performance_in_ukraine_shows/i0jy8yx/,1647214969,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647186156.0,

117,[],False,,long_time_lurker_01,,,[],,,,text,t2_ieemz,False,True,"SS: Russia has asked China for military ​equipment to ​support its invasion of Ukraine, ​according to US officials, sparking concern in ​the White House that Beijing ​may undermine western efforts to help Ukrainian forces defend their country.

US officials told the Financial Times that Russia had requested military equipment and other assistance since the start of the invasion. They declined to give details about what Russia had requested.

Another person familiar with the situation said the US was preparing to warn its allies, amid some indications that China may be preparing to help Russia. Other US officials have said there were signs that Russia was running out of some kinds of weaponry as the war in Ukraine extends into its third week.

The White House did not comment. The Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for a comment.

The revelation comes as Jake Sullivan, US national security adviser, heads to Rome for talks on Monday with Yang Jiechi, China’s top foreign policy official.

Before leaving Washington on Sunday, Sullivan warned China not to try to “bail out” Russia by helping Moscow to circumvent the sanctions that the US and its allies have imposed on President Vladimir Putin and his regime.

“We will ensure that neither China, nor anyone else, can compensate Russia for these losses,” Sullivan told NBC television on Sunday. “In terms of the specific means of doing that, again, I’m not going to lay all of that out in public, but we will communicate that privately to China, as we have already done and will continue to do.”

The request for equipment and other kinds of unspecified military assistance comes as the Russian military struggles to make as much progress in Ukraine as western intelligence believe they expected.

It also raises fresh questions about the China-Russia relationship, which has grown increasingly strong as both countries express their opposition to the US over everything from Nato to sanctions.

China has portrayed itself as a neutral actor in the Ukraine crisis and has refused to condemn Russia for invading the country. The US has also seen no sign that Chinese president Xi Jinping is willing to put any pressure on Putin.

The two leaders signed a joint statement in Beijing last month describing the Beijing-Moscow partnership as having “no limits”, in another sign that the two capitals were drawing even closer together.",94eb6c4d77222b7e2b521acee19bedaca75ce804,True,False,,,,,0,1647203430,,0,{},i0j7rp2,True,t3_tdfpjy,False,True,t3_tdfpjy,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tdfpjy/us_claims_russia_has_asked_china_for_military/i0j7rp2/,1647203444,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647174630.0,

European countries including Germany, the Netherlands and Turkey have tactical nuclear weapons on their soil assigned to them. They need US approval but they can use them. Plus the French and British have strategic weapons. 

Theatre level weapons are usually seen as too easy a step into strategic weapons so the idea is that Europe can have tactical weapons available as a deterrent against the sort of strikes people are fantasizing Putin might pull. But they do not need or want the risks of theatre weapons so they all scaled back the IRBM treaty. 

Its not ideal but given that smart weapons really have replaced much of the role of tactical weapons, I am struggling to see many uses for IRBMs by Europe other than the one of case of a maniac leader threatening a response that would not see UK\\French release their strategic weapons but somehow something something bigger than tactical? Also the UK has its weapons with differing explosion settings so can actually use a single missile as a ""theatre"" weapon as a final demonstration of willingness to use. 

Its going to take a very convoluted scenario for me to buy into this. 

If someone wants to go tactical nuclear and the US does not release tactical weapons, they are not going to use other assets like conventional cruise missiles. 

The current crisis is largely down to Ukraine being one of the last places Europe cares about that is not in either NATO or the EU or just the Alps (Swiss). This is kind of exploiting decades of being a bit lax on defence. That is not going to happen again.

For countries like Poland this kind of talk is also politically important, and whether it's reasonable or not, has a historical basis.

Treating it as an acceptable or even ideal situation not only ignores these risks, it ignores the lessons we should have learned from literally every other time we went with ""support and prolong an insurgency as a proxy war against another great power"". 

&gt; People won’t like the argument, I’m making but it makes sense from a realpolitik perspective. Bleeding Russia is an ideal outcome here and that is what we are doing.

Why is that the ideal outcome? I feel like it's falling into the 19th/20th century image of international relations being dominated by great power conflict, and that each great power has an overriding imperative to enhance its own position and degrade the others' positions. (It's also a continuation of IR realists' *incredibly annoying* habit of treating their theories as obviously correct and dismissing all other theories as clearly incorrect.)

From my perspective - and I think it's shared by many policymakers - the ideal outcome is for Russia to end its invasion quickly, in a negotiated peace where Russia may achieve some of its goals, but that generally is not worth the cost of its invasion (to discourage similar military actions in the future). And after that, the ideal situation is for Putin to retire to spend more time with his family, and for the new Russian leadership to pursue a foreign policy based on maintaining cordial, cooperative relationships with its neighbors, and on the domestic front, to focus on diversified economic growth.

Note that my ideal situation is one where Russia is *stronger* - wealthier, more stable, and more able to achieve its policy goals within the framework of the international system. It's preferable for Russia to be successful, because states that are successful have more incentive to work within the international system, versus challenge it; it's preferable for the international system to be successful, because it's brought us a relatively peaceful and prosperous era. 

Approaching this situation as a great power conflict within realist theory may very well decrease Russia's power relative to the US and the EU, but it also throws away all the progress we've made toward a more peaceful and prosperous world, decreasing everyone's security and making everyone poorer.",cbd146f35618b072bf0cc8e941bca480e248fc4d,True,False,,,,,0,1647197925,,0,{},i0iv2yf,False,t3_td6gzn,False,False,t1_i0ia66b,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/td6gzn/ukraine_megathread_march_13/i0iv2yf/,1647197938,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647169125.0,

TB-2s use the Turksat network. Those are generally based around Ku band channels with about 36mhz of analog bandwidth. I couldn't find any information on what quadrature and coding scheme they use via google, but a very conservative estimate would be they're in the 10 bit/s/hz territory for spectral efficiency (by comparison, LTE is capable of 30 bit/s/hz). So they're in the 100 mbit category per channel, with a couple dozen channels per sat. SD video is around 1 mbit, HD video around 5 mbit (double those numbers if you're using a decades old braindead codec).

So we've got a \*lot\* of headroom vs jamming here.

Additionally, the satcom link is directional via a parabolic dish, and a jammer will have a hard time getting into the LoS of that.

To make an analogy, imagine we're talking about a drag race, and whether or not some car is capable of doing a sub 12 second quarter mile. You mention the Carnot efficiency limit means that cars have a max speed.

Ukraine as a proxy conflict to drain Russia is more beneficial to the US than an escalation in the hope of a negotiated peace where Ukraine has to make some sort of concessions to Russia (i.e. neutrality).",ec5b2e820548554e3bdbd990a6fc06b94d342427,True,False,,,,,0,1647189242,,0,{},i0ia66b,False,t3_td6gzn,False,True,t1_i0i43s3,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/td6gzn/ukraine_megathread_march_13/i0ia66b/,1647189263,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647160442.0,

1. Create, cajole, manage, smooth, assist, and flatter in any way needed to build a long-term unified Western response across about 50 nations - Current Grade - A+
2. Support Ukraine with Military intel, equipment, training and advice to any step short of Nuclear Exchange - Current grade - A
3. Use the coalition from Step 1 to strangle Russia into economic collapse - Current grade - B-

After that, the strategic goals are more subtle. There is a very real risk that, in attempting to make Ukraine a vassal of Russia, the result is Russia becomes a vassal of China. We would like to avoid that.

We'd also like to avoid any release of nuclear weapons. That would be very bad.

Keeping chemical and biological weapons off the battlefield would be nice, too.

So far Biden is mostly doing his job well by building a Coalition against Russia, avoiding escalation to Nuclear exchange, and bleeding Russia dry with sanctions and military support for Ukraine.

And, importantly, none of us mouthing off on Twitter have any idea what the back channels are saying. People very close to Putin are talking to people very close to Biden, and I would be astonished if the senior Russian Military were unaware of NATO's real 'red lines.'

NATO as a whole is playing this well. If you look carefully you can see three or four aircraft carriers on operations in the Med. Suddenly a lot of training opportunities for NATO troops have opened up in the Baltic nations.

Turkey has taken the traditional step of closing the Dardanelles to any nation involved in war.

The savage violence that Russia is inflicting in Ukraine is morally devastating to us all.

Western leadership, particularly Biden and Macron, is carefully avoiding a nuclear exchange while utterly destroying Russia economically and militarily so it will never be able to try this again.

Earlier transfer of stingers before the war and training on using them, more money and trainers for the Ukraine forces and so on. Ukrainian forces are doing relatively well for what they are, but they could have been way better prepared. Sponsoring larger purchases of tb-2's and flooding them with ATGM's and RPG's earlier (perhaps preparing a stock for such rapid transfer in one of the NATO European storages), working with Ukraine on  creating mine fields, for instance on the border with Crimea and developing tactical rapid mining capabilities and so on.

Another thing he could have done, and should have done sooner is stage large NATO exercises on Russian borders away from Ukraine closer to Russian invasion to Ukraine, hoping to divert Russian forces and attention or delay the invasion a bit more as large shipments of war material started to flow into Ukraine from the west. Baltics, Georgia, Finland if they'd have it, Norway, Japan.

Props to the Ukrainians for their rapid response at Hostomel preventing an airlift but the northern approach to Kiev was far from an well-emplaced position. In fact this was a textbook airborne drop into an unprepared defensive line to disrupt it in advance of a land attack. 

For all the other air drops in the early days we lack much verified information. But after that Russian commanders surely realised that they were facing a lot of resistance and in many cases well-prepared defenses.

in previous conflicts, russia has alleviated this problem with heavy use of allied militia forces as additional infantry, both as urban combat fighting force and to actually control the territory that their spearheads have pushed through. they obviously don't have enough of them now, which leads to a situation not unlikely the german invasion in 1941, where germany effectively controled the major cities and roads, but large parts of the countryside were effectively in the hand of soviet partisans.

russias high reliance on artillery can also be traced back to this problem. but since the ukrainians jam their communication, especially with their allied militas who basically all use unencrypted civilian chinese radios, they also can't effectively call in arty strikes. also their artillery is incredibly supply hungry and need a constant stream of supply trucks. however, these trucks need to be driven by conscripts through territory which they don't effectively control, which throws us right back at problem number 1 (they also don't have enough supply trucks).

And what stands out is how much, in the early days OF WW2, seemingly singular local actions were part of a larger plan, but were played as one offs by The Nazis in an attempt to obfuscate the general build up and push towards greater expansion.

In all aspects of Russia's current push, it seems that they are failing almost to the point of it being planned. 

It seems to me that besides some geographical gains in ukrainian, that they ultimately seem hell bent on doing anything possible to get the US into a fight. Every action seems geared toward this goal. 

I suspect China is behind this.

 I suspect China is using Russia as the bait, with the initial push designed with the ultimate goal of pulling the US into a direct fight.

I suspect that China plans to wait till the US has commited and moved a majority of its focus to eastern Europe, and become bogged down... and then plans to initiate its long stated goal of retaking Taiwan and moving toward further expansion and the ultimate goal of unseatimg the US as the world leader. 


CHINA has stated openly for decades now, that the US is the country it intends to contest militarily when the time is right.

Assuming that there is a longer game being played by multiple players , like in the early days of WW2....  Who is taking a count of Chinese troop movements?

Who is zooming out to look at all of the potential modern Axis powers aside from Russia... China,  North Korea,  India, Pakistan, Iran, ect.

603,[],False,,Mindless-Tailor-3592,,,[],,,,text,t2_84frwci9,False,False,"I concur that New Zealand needs a air combat component for a number of reasons. Firstly, looking at it from a geo-political perspective, a state's military component is link to the state's right to self determination. This could mean a sovereign state may impose its will trough violence. An air arm component presents another combination of that of New Zealand's other components of its military, primarily the Navy and the Army. My comments highlights what political commentators refer to as 'Realism', whereby the state is dominate within the international system and that multi-lateral forums are unable to enforce the international system rule of law. Thus, it presents a state like New Zealand and insurance policy via strategic assets.

Secondly, no military operation is done in isolation and is therefore conduct with 'Manoeuver and Combined Arms' approach. The trend I have observed among commentators is an over focus on 'Niche' defence approaches and framed around peace keeping operations, for which I would suggest to the reader that it is an operation with over 20 type of operations from observing to peace keeping. Still, state centric in application and thus a short limiting tool.

This leads onto another issue, especially within New Zealand and that is context. Notably to the wider public. Such comments on defence is often dismissed by academics or disjointed stalwarts from a by gone era that creates a significant gap in discussion. I draw your attention to an article; 'NZ's Strategic Apathy' and 'Timing is Everything'. The latter discusses the politics of defence acquisition.

That being said and drawing focus to the initial question could NZ restart it's Fighter Jet Arm, the answer 'Yes' it could but in reality, in practice 'No'. This is largely due to the context issue (as mentioned above) and the legacy of 90s era defence politics (ref: 'Timing is Everything') as long as the present cohort is in the defence establishment, the continued mastery of inaction will continue by those bureaucrats. 

But, what would be ideal for NZ? - I would recommend the JAS 39 Saab Gripen. The reasons are: (i) Cost. It has the cheapest value for money (ii) It is NATO compatible. This aligns with meeting international compliances (iii) SAAB will establish a localised industry that can be developed further for economic benefits (iv) it is similar in nature to NZ's predecessor, meaning the organisational knowledge can be established steadily and quicker than other options (v) From a capabilities perspective, it does allot extremely well and therefore a solid 4.5 generation fighter that uses electronic counter measures rather than structural or chemical. I am talking about stealth (vi) Lastly, it was structured around Sweden's BAS 90 doctrine, which means it has a small logistical foot print / infrastructure. It can land on roads, under 500mtr and be refilled and rearmed in under 10min by a ground crew much like a pit crew in a car racing event. This provides, an opportunity to deploy in the South West Pacific, under the policy of the 'Pacific Pivot'.

 Ironically, in the 1980s Exercise 'Joint Venture' proved this by the RNZAF and with another sense of irony, the birth place for RNZAF operations from WW2. No other state could achieve, what NZ could achieve, should the 'Masters of inactivity' within the NZ defence establishment be removed.",24189540788d49145d6bea23d55e06c1e49aafa4,True,False,,,,,0,1647157826,,0,{},i0gwm3s,False,t3_g4os3s,False,True,t3_g4os3s,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/g4os3s/how_much_would_it_cost_new_zealand_to_restarts/i0gwm3s/,1647157839,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647129026.0,

Given the widespread reports during this war of Russian equipment in poor condition, I've been thinking about this possibility for a while:
* Putin fires tactical atomic weapon at some empty plot of Ukrainian land, and announces it as a ""demonstration"" of Russian might.
* The weapon is a dud.
I'm not sure whether this outcome might not be worse in the long run, in terms of geopolitical stability, than if the weapon performs as expected! 

And I have been surprised by its absence in the current conflict as it was often cited as a possible first move by Russia. The author here brings up multiple points that I did not know about and makes a reasonable argument for why Russia has held back its cyber capabilities.

One reason that the author did not mention that I have bouncing around in my head; is that perhaps Russia sees this conflict as a regional war, and is reluctant to use/burn strategic assets in carrying it out. Much the same reason we have seen a lack of irreplaceable strategic air assets. 

A quote I found interesting:

&gt; It is perhaps tempting to consider cyber operations to be more assertive than economic sanctions, but not as escalatory as a missile strike, being somehow below the threshold of a use of force or an armed attack. The trouble is that international law is perfectly clear: with any attack, it is the resulting effect, not the means used to deliver it, that dictates whether it is a use of force or an armed attack. A cyber operation that resulted in a certain level of destruction or fatality, would so qualify.

He has since established and led a major UK national cyber programme, as well as led GCHQ intelligence efforts across the whole breadth of national intelligence and security priorities. As a senior member of the national security community he contributed to the design and implementation of UK defence and security strategy, and managed relationships with a wide range of international security partners.",ad5790fb07dbe4afa4bad5da6f05b01a549e890e,True,False,,,,,0,1647142320,,0,{},i0g8vg5,True,t3_tcxx5l,False,True,t3_tcxx5l,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tcxx5l/russiaukraine_pressing_the_right_button_at_the/i0g8vg5/,1647142337,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647113520.0,

Kremlin groupthink seems to be that the west will abandon Ukraine as long as they can't be used for proxy war against Russia, and they have confidence in their propaganda channels in Europe and the US. A potential exit strategy would be to push for some sort of ceasefire/peace deal where Russia maintains de facto control over Crimea and the separatist areas of the Donbas, probably also pushing strongly for control of some territory north of Crimea (ex: Kherson) because securing fresh water for Crimea is a crucial strategic goal. Crimea's fresh water reserves are under 5% since the canal from the Dnieper river was shut down after the 2014 annexation, and Crimea has basically no fresh water source without the canal from the north - and the situation in Crimea has gotten worse in recent years due to drought/climate change.

The EU has economic minimum standards that Ukraine will be hard-pressed to meet, especially if there is strong support to not relax standards for Ukraine. Ukraine is already below the minimum and having widespread economic destruction isn't going to help. It's also reasonably feasible to prevent NATO admission on the basis of internal conflict within Ukraine or because accepting a country currently/recently at war with Russia is too high of a risk. Russia might overestimate their ability to cow NATO into not offering protection to Ukraine, even after Russia withdraws.

A possible exit plan is for Russia to destroy Ukraine's economic viability, and then offer to withdraw if Ukraine cedes certain territory. Then Russia could pivot to disinformation campaigns about how Ukraine isn't ""ready"" to join EU/NATO, and promote misinformation on how they are an impoverished country of uneducated neonazi nationalists, etc.",1e24d88c372db91b085669f675e876ca5dbcfa09,True,False,,,,,0,1647142260,,0,{},i0g8rfk,False,t3_tcgkf7,False,True,t1_i0fncqf,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tcgkf7/trying_to_estimate_the_russian_combat_arms/i0g8rfk/,1647142278,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1647113460.0,

Since the end of the Cold War, Beijing has rapidly modernized its missile force, growing from a small arsenal of cumbersome, inaccurate ballistic missiles into a formidable force of precision-guided ballistic and cruise missiles, loitering munitions, and—most recently—hypersonic weapons.

&gt; China’s deployment of hypersonic weapons has attracted significant attention, and for good reason. Hypersonic weapons combine the extreme speeds of ballistic missiles with the maneuverability and lower-altitude flight of cruise missiles, stressing traditional means of early warning and defense. While ballistic and cruise missiles make up the vast majority of China’s missile arsenal, even a small number of hypersonic weapons pose new and unique threats. This challenge highlights the need to reconceptualize the United States’ approach to air and missile defense. This means investing in space-based sensors and the various ways we can disrupt Chinese attack plans, both offensively and defensively. In doing so, we can better posture our forces against missile threats of all kinds.

5. Belorussia. Seems like Russia is working hard to have their army enter the conflict, between false flags and appointing Russian officers to their corps. Hard to say how effective this will be.

Russian BTG's are adhoc formations created around one of the brigade's  manuever battalion and reinforced with brigade assets. They originally were created because Russia lacks the contract soldiers needed to field an entire brigade and also because the proxy war's Russia found itself fighting didn't need brigade level units. The amount of fires that a BTG has is high compared to its manuever units. A BTG will have attached anyehere from a single battery(six pieces of artillery) to an entire battalion(18 pieces). To put that in perspective A U.S. Brigade Combat Team, a formation one echelon bigger, only has a battalion. Aside from that a brigade may attach air defense, tanks, intel, etc. The problem with the BTG is that its suppose to act as a unit independent of its brigade. A BTG doesn't have enough infantry to probably pull that off. It needs forces to screen, pull local security and convoy escort. As much as 50% of the BTG's infantry are tied up in such duties. Moreover this estimate was made during the 2014 conflict, were BTG commanders were able to utilize separatist to pull some of these duties. Overall, this leaves little forces for the BTG commander to use to secure terrain, and defend or attack with. A large amount of losses are gonna be infantry due to the job of infantry. Without infantry, A BTG can't secure or hold terrain. With that being said, most Russian brigades only seem to be fielding 2 BTG when they theoretically should be able to field 3*. It possible, although I have no evidence nor seen anything suggesting this from osint, that the 3rd battalion may have been broken up to reinforce it's two BTG's.

*Technically a Russian Brigade has maneuver 4 battalions, except the 4th is of the opposite arm(i.e tank beigades have on motor rifle battalion and motor rifle have a tank).

The relevant argument is quite simple:

&gt;I have only the greatest respect for George Kennan. John Mearsheimer is a giant of a scholar. But I respectfully disagree. The problem with their argument is that it assumes that, had nato not expanded, Russia wouldn’t be the same or very likely close to what it is today. What we have today in Russia is not some kind of surprise. It’s not some kind of deviation from a historical pattern. Way before nato existed—in the nineteenth century—Russia looked like this: it had an autocrat. It had repression. It had militarism. It had suspicion of foreigners and the West. This is a Russia that we know, and it’s not a Russia that arrived yesterday or in the nineteen-nineties. It’s not a response to the actions of the West. There are internal processes in Russia that account for where we are today.

You can further ask - why did Polan, Romania, the Baltics, all the former soviet/Warsaw pact bloc, why did they jump with open arms into NATO at the first chance they got? Because they **hated** being under Russian rule. Frankly, it sucks. NATO never invaded those countries, and never coup-ed their governments to keep them in like the USSR did to Hungary and Czechoslovakia.

If your family friend views the USA as a colonial empire, its not worth trying to change his mind on that point.
