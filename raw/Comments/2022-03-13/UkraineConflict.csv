,[],False,,BlueMaxx9,,,[],,,,text,t2_6frbtgds,False,False,"I’m sure the question of ‘how will Russia respond’ is high up on the list of things that are considered for any support the west is giving Ukraine. At this point, it really isn’t clear what Russia could or would do about it if the west further armed Ukraine.

It isn’t likely that Russia would attack NATO given the problems they are having with an opponent that was technologically inferior and they had almost encircled from the start. Attacking a NATO member at this point would be inviting a reprisal that could very well kick them out of Ukraine entirely, losing their current gains. Nuclear response isn’t a realistic option either. The moment Russia launches a nuke, that is the end of their country as a world power. That is an action that would galvanize the entire world to turn against them and give the west an excuse to forcibly remove their nuclear weapons. No matter how crazy Putin is, he can’t launch nukes on his own, and it is incredibly unlikely the rest of the power structure in Russia would let him do it.

Russia could try to push down the western border of Ukraine to cut off supplies, but at this point they would likely have to pull troops off another area to do it. They could maybe try declaring their own no-fly zone over Ukraine to justify blowing anything and everything out of the sky, but I’m not sure they actually have the ability to do it. They could maybe use it as justification for stepping up attacks on civilian infrastructure, or use the move at home to help justify what they are doing and get back some public support, but that isn’t exactly a great trade. Other than that, I’m not sure what sending in jets would give Russia an opportunity to do that they aren’t doing now.

I still don’t think the US is going to give away 20-30 F-16s, regardless of Russias possible response, but at this point it really isn’t clear what Russia could do about it if NATO decided to give more advanced arms to Ukraine.",d4284fcb68152e431220c1f5a4099561764a88dc,True,False,,,,,0,1647215955,,0,{},i0k0e5k,False,t3_tdb5lf,False,True,t3_tdb5lf,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tdb5lf/gop_sen_portman_i_dont_understand_why_us_not/i0k0e5k/,1647215968,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1647187155.0,,,,

Research into pathogens is necessary work, and largely different from research into how to weaponize pathogens or make worse ones. 

If there's evidence of weapons research occurring, funded by the US or not, I haven't seen it.

There's probably also university nuclear physics departments and I think an experimental reactor or two, but that's not the same as manufacturing nukes, either.

Considering US politics has played a large role in this conflict and I responded to a bridge comment that put the two together I think it's fine. It didn't come out of left field as you suggest. 

But you know what I haven't done? I was never unkind, I never name called, and I never treated you subhuman as you attempt to do with me. You truly hate me for my political ideology as so so many people from the left do. And I mean true hatred. Emotional unrational hatred. 

Nice virtue signal though regarding the cruelty of the war. 

I very well understand the tragedy of war. I fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. So you don't need to lecture me about the toll it takes. I've been dealing with it directly and indirectly since I went just over 18 years ago.

&gt; What we now must recognise is that the British government&amp;#039;s response to the Skripal poisoning, and specifically Boris Johnson&amp;#039;s role in it, was a glaring national security failure.

&gt; Johnson&amp;#039;s meeting with Alexander Lebedev was undertaken without a security protocol, the knowledge of his officials or, it must be assumed, the prime minister To understand this, we need to rewind a few months earlier.

&gt; As ever in Britain, we latch on to the wrong details at the wrong time: last week, following news reports, it became a scandal that Johnson had made Evgeny a lord against the advice of his own security services.

Secondly, I didn't question nor pose a question as to what tf a poll was for. But since you want to take things out of context to argue, I'll entertain you briefly - the purpose of polling is to gather data of favorability in regards to a specific person, place, or thing using a control group not an entire populous. Which was my point, a point I'm quite certain was clear.

Thirdly, as Zperic1 pointed out, polls are easily manipulated. From the parameters of requirements of the group being questioned, to outright lying about the final outcomes of the poll can be changed to fit any narrative the pollster chooses or is instructed/paid to give the public that the poll is intended to sway and/or inform. 

Last but not least, my point was quite simple, in the grand scheme of things due to the manipulability of polls and the small groups they tend to question this poll means jack nothing and proves nothing. It doesn't represent the greater commonwealth, albeit given your questioning I'm pretty sure you think it does. It won't change what's happening in Ukraine. It won't change the minds of the brainwashed parents in Russia, that even their child(ren) living in Ukraine couldn't change.

At a nearby barracks, military evaluators placed Mr. Zeqiri in a group for rapid deployment, and he received a Ukrainian military uniform, a sleeping bag, a flak jacket and helmet, an AK-74 semiautomatic rifle and 120 rounds of ammunition, he said later in a text message.  
The next day, already in Kyiv, he said he was disappointed not to receive advanced American weapons. He was also concerned about a convoy of Russian tanks and troops that he heard was advancing southward on the capital.  
“Seriously, dude, it’s not what I thought it was,” Mr. Zeqiri said. “Where’s my M4? Where’s my Javelin?”

,[],False,,anton-bg,,,[],,,,text,t2_k3nu56db,False,False,"I watched a video on YouTube from a professional pilot called ""Mentour Pilot"" who explained all this. 

Apparently, most national authorities take aircraft maintenance EXTREMELY seriously. If an airline cannot produce enough documentation in the form of maintenance logs that definitively show that the aircraft is properly maintained and parts have been replaced according to manufacturer spec and therefore safe to fly, authorities may ban them from their airspace. As an example, my country's national flag carrier (Philippine Airlines) was banned from EU airspace for a time because for this reason. 

The same video also explains how parts cannot be simply ""lost"" and put into Russian-owned aircraft. Apparently aircraft parts, at least the ones that matter, are not bought in the same as going to your local car dealership and cannot be installed by non-certified mechanics. All the critical parts are ordered from the manufacturer and are tracked with a sophisticated system of record keeping including serial numbers and maintenance sign-offs by certified personnel. To be on the safe side, most authorities simply disallow aircraft from entering their airspace if there is any doubt on their maintenance. 

As to using Russian-made engines on aircraft, Russian engine technology is years behind Rolls Royce, Pratt &amp; Whitney, GE and other western aircraft engine manufacturers. Russian manufacturers are also unable to produce at any scale, which will be further exacerbated with sanctions as apparently some of their components aren't even produced locally. 

Even if Russia is able to manufacture enough engines to install on Boeing or Airbus made aircraft, or if they are able to source engines from China, they will need to be tested thoroughly and re-certified to ensure their safety and compatibility with the airframe. This is a process that takes months, if not years. And even then, it is extremely unlikely these Frankenstein planes will be allowed to fly anywhere outside of Russia.

It is extremely unlikely for China (or any other country's) airline to supply Russian airlines with Boeing or Airbus parts from their own stocks. Because of the rigorous system of record keeping, Airbus and Boeing will eventually find out and may result in them refusing to provide further parts and maintenance. No airline in their right minds will risk their credibility, supply chain, safety and business for Russian airlines.

Finally, even if for some reason Russia is able to fly Frankenstein aircraft into foreign airspace, they do not have the same maintenance and supply infrastructure as western manufacturers. Where in Brazil or Southeast Asia will they easily find parts and qualified maintenance personnel for Aviadvigatel, NPO Saturn, or Klimov should something go wrong? Without an efficient supply chain and maintenance infrastructure, they would be massively expensive and unprofitable.",9c82a10fdeb6b9cee5d94a1b9f049f27f774498f,True,False,,,,,0,1647172818,,0,{},i0hev2n,False,t3_tcxcev,False,True,t1_i0h20pq,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tcxcev/what_to_do_about_billions_of_leased_aircraft_in/i0hev2n/,1647172832,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1647144018.0,,,,

&gt; The BBC has spoken to a serving mercenary and a former fighter with close links to one of Russia&amp;#039;s leading mercenary organisations, who have shared details of the recruitment campaign.

&gt; The serving mercenary who spoke to the BBC said new recruits are being placed in units under the command of officers from the GRU, the Russian military intelligence unit of the ministry of defence.

&gt; The mercenary sources who spoke to the BBC, said the recruits are trained at the Wagner base in Mol&amp;#039;kino in southern Russia, next to a Russian army base.

I hope he and others who are displaced will find a new chapter or turn of events that they have not imagined, and that that is an even better one than the chapter they closed.
