Take a look at Vietnam, their communist government being iron hand means they are able to enforce regulation during covid situation and they are I think few of the successful countries in battling covid from spreading.

In the US, the next president, in less than 4 years later, immediately reverse the regulations made by the previous. For good or for bad this is wasting everyone time. Either this regulations should not be placed in the first place or it should be continued.

Basically if someone can no longer fight, even if they haven't surrendered they are basically a prisoner and therefore subject to protections under the Geneva convention that way including the right to medical attention.

If you want evidence of someone being charged for executing a wounded combatant look up the case of ""Marine A"", the defence tried to play it off as a mercy killing, but this was contradicted by video footage of the marine in question joking about it and using the phrase ""shuffle off this mortal coil you cu*t"".

Not saying it isn't a moral grey area but my understanding of the issue is that it is almost certainly a violation of the Geneva convention to execute wounded enemies

NATO doesn‚Äôt care so much about saving the Ukrainian people, what they really want is the end of Russia as we know it. The longer the conflict and the more death and destruction, the better it is for NATO. You will have a weak and defeated Russia, and a dependent militarized and devastated Ukraine, we all know how important Ukrainian soil is to the world and they will be in debt.
