&gt;Gibbs is a critique of humanitarian intervention, and I highly recommend it for that

It's a critique full of misinformation intentionally trying to mislead it's readers to a biased conclusion. Your unwillingness to admit the inaccuracies in this book rather upholding it as an unarguable truth puts into jeopardy your arguments.

&gt;And my arguments are mocked by moralizers like you who don't actually know anything about the Bosnian War. You just want to promote a Disneyfied fairy tale story of good Bosniaks versus evil Serbs, and how evil almost triumphed against good until at the last moment, the US saved the day by dropping bombs on those dastardly Serbs and then rewarded them by giving them 49% of the territory of BiH including Srebrenica.

I am no moralizer and I can see the flaws on all sides of the conflict but your arguments are pushing blatantly false facts to try and paint the Serbs as equals to Croats and Bosniaks and trying to whitewash their crimes to make their actions in Bosnia more plateable to those wanting to learn. All while using sources that have been discredited.

&gt;Have you ever actually read even part of a single transcript of any day of anyone's trial at the ICTY? Say, Milosevic's trial, or Karadzic's, or Mladic's, or Prlic's, or Oric's etc. etc.? Because I have. For all of those people. You haven't.

I am to take your word you have read and memorized entire trial transcripts of multiple people within the ICTY some that where ongoing for months? I can claim to have read the constitution of 192 nations and you have no way to disprove me it's hearsay. But sure what part of the trial do you believe topple the main argument that the VRS conducted ethnic cleansing?

&gt;But I love how you constantly appeal to authority that you have never touched yourself.

The Bosniaks were completely surrounded by the two aforementioned factions, leaving them unable to smuggle arms properly without doing it via the territory of the Serbs or Croats.The Bosniaks did receive arms from Iran via Croatia but since the Bosniaks were also at war with the Croats during a significant portion of the war, this didn't pan out that well. Furthermore, when it was possible for the Bosniaks to smuggle arms via Croatia, the Croats obviously took a chunk of those arms , made it more expensive and on top of that, they did not allow all types of arms to be sent to the Bosniaks.

The bigger point is that the US was well aware that several countries (including ahem Iran) were violating the embargo by providing arms to the Bosniaks; and the US response to this was to look the other way.
&gt; 

There is nothing false in what IdeaR said. The embargo effectively only affected the Bosniaks. Unlike its neighbors in Serbia and Croatia, the Bosniak population of Bosnia was isolated without access to arms smuggled across the borders. The embargo was officially applicable to all sides but it  only affected the Bosniaks.

&gt; Also false. The original view from the beginning (after the war had begun) was to achieve some sort of multiethnic, sovereign Bosnia-Herzegovina. This can be seen in the failed Vance-Owen Peace Plan, which was a joint product of the EU (Lord Owen) and UN (Cyrus Vance) and which proposed

What states say and what they effectively do is something completely different. Openly calling for the partitioning of a sovereign state is not exactly the way to approach ones goals on the international stage.
See the Clinton tapes in this regard:

[""Clinton said U.S. allies in Europe blocked proposals to adjust or remove the embargo. They justified their opposition on plausible humanitarian grounds, arguing that more arms would only fuel the bloodshed, but privately, said the president, key allies objected that an independent Bosnia would be ""unnatural"" as the only Muslim nation in Europe. He said they favored the embargo precisely because it locked in Bosnia's disadvantage. Worse, he added, they parried numerous alternatives as a danger to the some eight thousand European peacekeepers deployed in Bosnia to safeguard emergency shipments of food and medical supplies.""

[],False,,considertheoctopus,,,[],,,,text,t2_3nly40ii,False,False,"Agree to disagree. Any solution that resulted in the dissolution of BiH, with half going to Croatia and half to Serbia, would have been a bloodbath, IMO. The process of ethnic cleansing took place to remove Bosniaks from what Milosevic considered Serb land. If Muslims remained from any partition they would have been removed by force. And just as they did not give peaceful passage to the residents of the many towns that were ethnically cleansed, there would have been no quarter for any remaining after a partition. Croatia adopted a similar strategy in the south. The bloodbath did not occur because of two major armies fighting tooth and nail, it occurred because of one army ethnically cleansing a territory. The civilians were the ones giving the blood, mostly. It wasn’t like it would have stopped if Bosnia had simply surrendered.

As for the situation today, no, it is not partitioned. It is a sovereign state with a single federal government, though a weak and decentralized one. Republika Srpska is an entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, despite its autonomy and Dodik’s ramblings about victimhood.

But yes, it has become a segregated society, which is problematic. Some ways that’s improving (in Mostar there are elections again and some schools are now ethnically integrated), others it isn’t (Mostar residents tend to self-organize ethnically by the two sides of the old bridge). Segregation is not state dissolution, nor partition between two adversarial states on either side. 

I think the just end to the war would have been the outright military defeat of Serbia by NATO (and Croatia, if necessary). The US at that point was the undisputed world hegemon and could have imposed its will. NATO decided to bomb Belgrade eventually anyway, though that’s another story. It would probably have caused a whole other set of problems but now, today, we have a negative peace with simmering tension among each ethnic group, each believing it has been wronged — but mostly among Serbs, who are constantly aggrieved over centuries-old victimization and who cannot deign to share land with those they consider un-Serbian.

The issue was Dayton gave too much power to each ethnic group allowing anyone to veto everything causing no reforms making it so the OHR was the only body that was able to push reforms.

Even today the West is still trying to push Bosnia down a Dayton path saying the constitution can change when Bosnia enters the EU even though Bosnia can not enter the EU because Dayton breaks multiple EU laws (it's a catch 22). It is clear Dayton is a failure akin to the Lebanon model.

Realistically BiH should follow European decentralized akin to Belgium, have 4-5 regions one president, one army, one parliament.

""In the Balkans, and especially in Bosnia and Herzegovina, images from Ukraine of besieged cities, massacres, and mass displacement are re-traumatizing a society that has never been allowed to heal after the wars that followed the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991. Along with the rest of the world, Bosnians have watched the razing of the Ukrainian city of Mariupol with horror. But having lived through the siege of Sarajevo and similar atrocities, Bosnians recognize the velocity and brutality of Russia's war on Ukraine more viscerally than others­­—and it puts them on edge.  
Russian President Vladimir Putin’s assault on Ukraine comes at a time when the Western Balkans have reached a level of tension and uncertainty unseen in decades. Ethnic nationalism threatens to destabilize the region once again, with local political leaders manipulating the public’s worst fears. President Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia has assumed close to complete control over his country’s media and is stoking unrest in Serb-inhabited parts of Kosovo. In Bosnia, his close ally Milorad Dodik, the Serb member of Bosnia’s tripartite state presidency, has advocated for secession of the Serb-controlled parts of the country. A similar alliance exists between the government of Croatia (an EU and NATO member) and Dragan Covic, the nationalist Bosnian Croat leader, who has called for what would amount to further ethnic partitioning of Bosnia. Many Bosnians have responded to growing corruption, the impunity enjoyed by political elites, and economic hardship by leaving the country altogether. The UN estimates that roughly 55,000 people leave Bosnia each year and has warned that if this pattern continues, Bosnia’s population could drop to 1.6 million in 2070 from today’s three million.  
Russia has played a hand in these developments. Putin has encouraged separatism, with the aim of generating disruption on the West’s frontiers. For years, Russia has actively sought to impede and deter Bosnia’s pursuit of EU and NATO membership, asserting that such moves constituted a provocation. Russia’s ambassador to Bosnia recently pointed to the invasion of Ukraine as an example of what could happen to Bosnia should it pursue NATO membership.  


But the Kremlin’s activities have depended heavily on local leaders pursuing their own agendas. What’s most troubling is that these leaders are often the same people the EU and the United States present as their partners in Bosnia’s democratic and economic development. By relying on a handful of “ethnocrats,” the EU and the United States have put the region on a dangerous path, one that could end with the dissolution of Bosnia and the redrawing of borders across the region—neither of which would happen peacefully.  
It didn’t have to be this way. The 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement ended the war and gave the West the tools it needed to forestall instability and violence and help keep the country on a more unified and democratic path. But those tools have gone unused for years. Instead, Western powers have allowed Bosnia to backslide into instability as nationalism surges in Serbia and Croatia. Now, the war in Ukraine represents an opportunity for the United States and its allies to carry out a long-overdue recalibration of their approach to Bosnia. The West has united in response to Russian aggression. That same energy and attention should be applied to the Balkans so that local actors who benefit from instability and Russian interference can no longer keep their chokehold on the state.""",c8b5743c52d8d60597b64baf7e091750db75cb44,True,False,,,,,0,1652883966,,0,{},i92s2wz,True,t3_use4q9,False,True,t3_use4q9,/r/geopolitics/comments/use4q9/bosnias_dangerous_path_how_us_policy_is_making_a/i92s2wz/,1652883983,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1652855166.0

From the report from International Committee for Nigeria (don't let the name fool you, it's started and chaired by Nigerians like Hundeyin) there's census evidence for this, areas completely changing their ethnic make up with none of the groups mentioned living there in the 60s living there by the most event census.

And data on the proportions dead being mostly a minority group implies a targeted series of events.

I actually keep hearing that the Nigerian Military is very good, like best in Nigeria but always wondered how much of that was due to Population. Do you know of any source that dives deeper into this?.

Yeah, I disagree on that last point. India - Pakistan is doing better than I would have assumed a single state where all these Muslim - Hindu tensions would do. Muslim-other group tensions in other places implies this would be a major issue, worse than the recorded riots.

I would say that there is more than sufficient evidence to call this ethnic cleansing, I have been looking more into this from other sources and an interview with a former governour on Channels TV as him saying that yeah he visited a community in 10 years interval and withnessed complete replacement of the local language to Fula and French. 

From the report from International Committee for Nigeria (don't let the name fool you, it's started and chaired by Nigerians like Hundeyin) there's census evidence for this, areas completely changing their ethnic make up with none of the groups mentioned living there in the 60s living there by the most event census.

Now if you want to focus more on the cultural aspect, then our german StAGN (Standing Committee on Geographical Names) did some stuff there. [Their work \(Jordan, Peter 2005\)](https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/48072#) used  8 crtieria to break down major regions in Europe:

(1) The historical impact left by German and Jewish culture (as specific characteristics) in addition to Slavic, Romanic and Hungarian layers of culture among other (that are also in evidence outside of Central Europe) 

(2) The coincidence or temporal succession of Protestantism and Catholicism while orthodoxy and Islam play only a minor role. 

(3) The early development of an urban system and middle class in comparison to Eastern and South-Eastern Europe as a counterweight to nobility, gentry and church

(4) The early existence of a free class of peasants who were not subordinate to a lord of the manor 

(5) A tradition of local and regional self-administra tion as a result of early political particularism 

(6) Cultural (i.e., linguistic and religious) diversity including ethnic diversity within states 

(7) Always tending towards the continent in political and economic terms (not overseas)

 (8) Late industrialisation in comparison to Western Europe, but early industrialisation in comparison to Eastern and South-Eastern Europe

which comes to the conclusion

&gt; This allows the conclusion that these territories can be subsumed under the term of South-Eastern Europe because they are under Byzantine influence, although the long Ottoman domination has also left sustainable traces. In contrast, Ea stern Europe means the portion of orthodox Europe under Byzantine influence that was only marginally impacted by the Ottoman Empire and hardly transformed by it. Furthermore, Northern Europe is the part of Europe that has remained totally Protestant with a low development density. Western Europe is subsumed under the concept of former colonial powers and territories that are orientated towards the Atlantic and sustainably impacted by the Reformation with an early urban structure and early beginnings of industrialisation. 

&gt; Finally, Southern Europe is the Catholic and essentially Romanic countries with a major seafaring tradition. The regional concepts defined according to these criteria are shown on maps that is supplemented by structuring.


The part about eastern europe:

&gt; What can be summarized as Eastern Europe covers that part of the Byzantine Orthodox Europe, which was only marginally influenced by the Ottoman Empire, without much lasting tranformation.

&gt; On the contrary, after the withdrawal of the Ottoman Empire, the formerly Ottoman-dominated territories on the Black Sea were even settled again by Christian refugees from the the Ottoman Empire (Gagauz, Bulgarians). During the Russian tsardom (from the middle of the 16th century until 1917) and
at the time of the Soviet Union (1917 - 1992) the parts of Eastern Europe outside of Russia have also experienced a Russian transformation, which manifested itself, among other things, in the
settlement of ethnic Russians as the educational and administrative elite in cities and as workers in industrial areas, the use of Russian as a language of education and communication,
often also as a colloquial language, in the Russophilia of ethnic minorities
ethnic minorities (Jews, Gagauz, Germans, etc.), in the Russophilia also by large parts of the
of the political and intellectual elite (Belarus, eastern and southern Ukraine) and in intensive trade links and other economic ties with Russia. Even after the end of the Soviet Union, much of this has been preserved.
