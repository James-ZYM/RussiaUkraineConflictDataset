&gt; * Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told the Senate Armed Services Committee last week that Putin could slide into “a more unpredictable and potentially escalatory trajectory” if the war drags on “or if he perceives Russia is losing in Ukraine.”

&gt; * Officials in Kyiv have complained that the longer the West dithers over sending the full complement of weapons it needs, the direr the consequences for Ukraine’s civilians and allows Russia more time to conduct sham local elections in areas it controls.",a24056c567aa2b1adeed1327bbf5d891ab46e3c9,True,False,,,,,0,1652918277,,0,{},i951xa5,False,t3_usb7wn,False,True,t3_usb7wn,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/usb7wn/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_18_2022/i951xa5/,1652918293,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652889477.0,

Specifically its reasonable *for Turkey* because the PKK for multiple decades has been its biggest internal security. The goals of the PKK ultimately come at the expense of Turkey’s territorial integrity so both sides goals are zero sum.  

I will acknowledge that   Turkish policies of forced assimilation of the Kurdish population are wrong, so I understand why Kurds decided to resist. 



 What do you think the Turkish government should be doing differently ? Should the Turks lay down their arms?  Should the Turks not be concerned that a PKK group holds significant territory south of  its border? 

The problem with your argument is that it is about framing Turkey as immoral which you conflate as being unreasonable.

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,[],,,,text,t2_2pdwadue,False,False,"What absolutely blows my mind about this topic was not that they didn't tell the troops when or if they'd invade, it was the lackadaisical attitude the military itself had to not take advantage of the time and resources to train versus sitting on their asses doing nothing.

They had been openly massing combat units on the border since last summer, to include doing training exercises that basically did nothing to adequately train them. They could have maintained OPSEC while also allowing  their troops to prep, using that time and resources to conduct critical pre-deployment training, especially that what is pertinent to this theater in question.

And this wasn't caused by Putin or the general staff, what I'm talking about is something that should have been addressed by the professional leaders down to the platoon level. That's really what separates good militaries from bad. In bad ones, when they have down time the leadership allow everyone to waste it. Good ones take every opportunity they can to get better. Spending a half year massing on Ukraine's borders was a huge opportunity to get better, but wasted. 

Even if they thought the invasion was going to be a joke, wouldn't include real fighting, or might not even take place, it was still an opportunity to get better. I've heard claims that the Russians in the past preferred deploying units to the Donbas War and Syria over training exercises to improve, as it was the same cost and effort to move them. Well, this time they had massed 3/4 of their ground forces for an extended period but apparently did nothing. 

Not many people know this but peacetime training for standing armies is usually generalized, sanitized, risk averse, and overall pretty shitty. There isn't much funding or enthusiasm to do hard training outside really top level units, usually SOF, because that costs a lot of money, breaks down equipment, and breaks down bodies. The fact of the matter is everyone wanting to impress their bosses to get promoted can do so without actually legitimately being prepared for war. Which is why when war is on the horizon most militaries jump through hoops to prepare in whatever time they have. Because then it's serious, no more time for fuck fuck games and excuses, because lives will be on the line soon. 

Normally only the fire breathing ""war fighters"" types are pushing for realistic training and lots of it all the time, but they often get  told to shut up ""and try out for selection"" (go SOF, motivation isn't desired in continuously conventional units). But in times when war is on the horizon even the bureaucrats and careerists in conventional units start feeling the urgency to take things serious. 

Suddenly, the normal ""check-the-block"" training is replaced by good training designed to actually replicate combat, as much as possible, to include levels of risk and danger that would be unheard of during normal peacetime training. Budgets for fuel, spare parts, and training ammo often open up. Distractions are limited because everyone is soldiering 24/7, no more family or garrison bullshit to eat away, commanders have their troops indefinitely. Because all sorts of different types of units are all staged nearby to each other they have a chance to link up to do some real combined arms training. Specific enemy threats can be considered and drills created and practiced, with unit SOPs that were iffy before becoming carved in stone. This would be the time to create a ""react to Javelin ATGM"" drill or try to shorten the response time between making contact and getting arty on target so Recon Fires Complex is more than theory. Etc

Additionally, a whole lot of turds exist in peacetime conventional units doing little else but converting food into shit, and it's during these periods that they either shape up or can be booted out. Nobody wants to go to war with a turd sandwich who fills a critical position simply because they have a pulse, which is the peacetime standard. On a war footing, leaders can introduce no-shit discipline on their units, shake things up. It's far better to go to war slightly understrength than with a unit filled with undesirables who have no business going to war. And pre-deployment periods are exactly when those can be not only be identified and weeded out but also replaced before D-Day/H-Hour. 

What the hell were they doing while waiting? Even expecting a parade style road march to Kyiv, that should have been one so well planned and rehearsed that NATO shits themselves from how well they executed a simple task. And God forbid military intelligence got the threat assessment wrong and the Ukrainians fought back, they'd have been in a good position to react. 

Putin didn't cause that. It's a systematic problem in their military, and they'll never improve until something this simple can be fixed: did you get a few hours freed up in your schedule?

An East/West distinction isn't helpful here, as the world leader in the necessary technology is a transnational with a Russian subsidiary, and again, with one of its 3 factories operating in Moscow as we type. So yes, in actual extant fact, Russia is at parity with the US and the UK in the ability to manufacture high power fiber lasers.

The rest of what's necessary to create a weapons system is also stuff that's clearly within Russia's capabilities, with the speed bump of sanctions complicating access to chips of various sorts.

It's important we keep appraisals rooted in fact, which is why terminology like ""on a higher level"" doesn't exist in serious discussions. That sort of thing functions for nationalistic cheer leadering, not better understanding what futures are possible vs not.

&gt;It's one thing to say it's possible, it's a whole different ballgame to implement it, build it, and put it on the battlefield within 5km of an enemy to do actual work. Let's put it this way, Bayraktar (or even any decent quadcopter) can spot it from way farther away than 5km. And artillery range is also quite a bit farther.

The range and duration on target they mention would be consistent with smaller drones, not going after a TB2. These can be located with spectrum monitoring equipment quite easily, however Russia does have very little of this equipment in inventory at the moment, and appears reluctant to move it across the border.

But as for a basic discussion of ""is this possible"" the answer is ""yes, definitively.""

&gt;So explain to me what they're going to use it for again? To shoot down 3 DJI Mavics, before being obliterated by Ukrainian artillery from 20 km away?

Yes, exactly this. Removing a DJI is going to have an impact on whether or not that shelling happens.

Time and again they've offered the Turks any assurances they could possibly dream of to show that they are not supplying weapons or training with the PKK. 

The YPG does have some ties with the PKK, they both exist share the same economical -political ideology of a brand of marxism. But Turkey doesn't really have any issue with that.

Turkey in many ways is similar to Russia, they to have colonial ambitions in Syria, Iraq, Cyprus, Greece, the Balkans and Africa and they're willing to exert their control via military force. The entire issue with the SDF is Turkey seeking imperial dominion over NE Syria.

Yeah, so far this has been very reliable pattern, and Russians cannot afford to do last stand with how few and how poorly motivated people they have. It's much easier to get Ukrainians to die for Mariupol than to get Buryats to die for Kherson which they couldn't even locate on a map before the war.

For Kherson, it's on the otherwise Ukrainian side of the river, and there's only about 4 bridges - one of them is unfortunately on as a dam, so it would need to be taken with some heavy fighting, but at least it's not any urban last stand. The rest can be just M777ed. Then Russia would be reduced to supplying a lot of troops over pontoon bridges over 500m wide river, or boats/ships. They'd probably just withdraw.

It's a rhetorical point. People are discussing the idea that Ukraine cannot possibly concede territory. Its factually incorrect, however upsetting the thought may be.

&gt; Zelenski specifically openly stated that there is no military solution for the DNR and LNR pre war.

To my knowledge he however didn't seem keen on a diplomatic solution either (once in power). Presumably because had he actually pushed ahead with one requiring concessions he would have triggered the nationalists.

The same way he clearly doesn't like azov, but feels unable to be openly critical of them when asked about it. Politics is a bitch.

&gt; Not sure how, but you missed the Russian imperialist invasion of Ukraine. With explicit intention of overthrowing the regime and subjugating the entire nation. The Ukrainians are fighting to prevent that.

Well clearly you've decided that an invasion was inevitable and the 3 months of very public negotiations meant nothing. I disagree.

Problem is there was never going to be another outcome once that started, but that's due to domestic political pressures rather than the actual viability of any option.",ef19332ca8bc8be93a1ece6053de0cbe7d50f632,True,False,,,,,0,1652896486,,0,{},i93mrxx,False,t3_usb7wn,False,True,t1_i93bw5p,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/usb7wn/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_18_2022/i93mrxx/,1652896501,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652867686.0,

Dara Massicot is a senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation. Before joining RAND, she served as a senior analyst for Russian military capabilities at the Department of Defense.  

Her work at RAND focuses on defense and security issues in Russia and Eurasia. She specializes in Russian military strategy, combat operations, and escalation dynamics. Her long-term interests include force posture, force planning, and grand strategy. 


---------------------

&gt; * It has been hampered by faulty planning assumptions, unrealistic timelines, and impractical objectives. It has suffered from inadequate supplies, bad logistics, and insufficient force protection. It has been impaired by poor leadership. These problems do not stop at technical equipment issues, poor training, or corruption. Rather, they are linked by **a core underlying theme: the military’s lack of concern for the lives and well-being of its personnel.** In Ukraine, the Russian military struggles to retrieve the bodies of its dead, obscures casualties, and is indifferent to its worried military families. It may spend billions of dollars on new equipment, but it does not properly treat soldiers’ injuries, and it generally does not appear to care tremendously whether troops are traumatized.

&gt; * This culture of indifference to its personnel fundamentally compromises the Russian military’s efficacy, no matter how extensively it has been modernized.

&gt; * The Russian military has a long history of mistreating its personnel and their frightened families. During the Soviet Union’s war in Afghanistan, many conscripts were not informed ahead of time that they were being sent to into combat.

&gt; * Had excessive operational security not trumped force protection, for instance, the military could have better prepared and trained the force for the kinds of grinding, urban battles they were certain to face. But because it was worried about leaks, the Russian military kept its plans a secret to almost all of the military (or at least to the rank and file), jeopardizing readiness and handicapping itself.

&gt; * The Russian military’s disregard for its soldiers has done more than undermine their combat performance. It has also tanked their morale and will to fight. 

&gt; * It will be nearly impossible for the Russian military to fix its internal cultural problem during this war. Indeed, even when the invasion ends, it will be difficult for the Russian military to reform, as it did in the aftermath of its five-day war against Georgia in 2008.

&gt; * That’s because, unlike with the Georgian war, Moscow cannot blame old equipment; the problem lies with the decision-makers and their decisions, and these individuals have not admitted that the military still has a systemic personnel maltreatment problem. 

&gt; * Russia’s top commanders are not apolitical warrior-scholars; they earned their positions by understanding that loyalty is more important than speaking truth to power.

&gt; * But these mothers’ hard work does not mean the military will correct course. Indeed, the current political climate in Russia is now perhaps even less likely to tolerate collective protests from soldiers’ families than it was in the late 1980s and 1990s. 

&gt; * The Russian military's experiment in having professional enlisted personnel is almost 20 years old. Its success relies on the prestige of military service and social trust that the Ministry of Defense worked to achieve through a series of new policies, benefits, and improved service conditions.",06a4552b167a47e1d47283e52c98ddb37f77e5fc,True,False,,,,,0,1652893475,,0,{},i93fam2,True,t3_ushfw3,False,True,t3_ushfw3,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ushfw3/the_russian_militarys_people_problem_its_hard_for/i93fam2/,1652893487,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652864675.0,

""Underestimating"" would be a reasonable take for predictions in the Donbas or South, maybe, but Odessa?  Nah, double their current assessed strength they're still not getting it.

Russia's invasion force has demonstrated in real time severe issues taking large cities.  If a large city puts up a fight (and Odessa is colossal), their options are limited, as Kharkiv, Kyiv, Sumy, and even in a way Mariupol showed.  They do not have the operational impetus to conquer both Mykolaiv and Odessa right now or in the forseeable future.

The only way this changes is a system-wide collapse of the Ukrainian government or military which isn't a circumstance it makes sense for the aforementioned bodies to plan for since they, well, collapse in that scenario.

&gt;Still, Red team main player (russia) is not in it with its full weight.

As the other guy pointed out, this mostly isn't true.  What resources they have left (other than massive mobilization whose likelihood is going down) in reserve aren't going to render their invasion force Odessa-capable.

It sounds strange, but Russia's standing peacetime army just isn't that big.  Already an colossal chunk of it is either already in theatre or out of service.

Now 45.000 of their most experienced troops are out of commission, their best munitions and equipment are either spent or severely degraded, their logistical capacity is reduced and their morale is shot.

They are right on the edge of being incapable of offensive operations entirely.

&gt;Also i'm not 'blaming the west'. I'm saying they're not innocent like you are claiming in your absurd refusal to take any responsibility.

The west literally had nothing to do with the Syrian civil war starting. You are blaming the west while the one solely responsible is Assad and Syrian citizens that wanted to overthrow the dictator. 

&gt;lmao no i'm not

Yes you were, you still are blaming Assad's war on the west.

&gt;Why are you deflecting so much?  


I directly addressed your point, are you confused? Why is it so hard for you to admit that Assads, Russian and Iranian actions in Syria, which included mass starvation of civilians, massacre of hundreds of thousands of civilians, chemical weapons against civilians, ethnic cleansing and torture of tens of thousands of civilians is worse than anything the west has ever done in Iraq?

&gt;Again... what?  


You brought up the fact that Russia was supporting a sovereign government while they were conducting the list of crimes above as a reason why it's not that bad. Try to keep up.

&gt;This has basically nothing to do with the points made.

You compared US-Ukraine relations to Iranian-Khataib Hezbollah relations. They are not the same for the reasons I've listed. Iranian proxies are controlled by Iran, were created by Iran and swear fealty to Iran. They are part of the Iranian armed forces under command of the Quds force and General Soleimani at the time. Meanwhile Ukraine is none of those.

Try re-reading if you have trouble remembering your own statements.

&gt;Also once again you seriously lack self awareness and the ability to objectively analyse things.

A sentence completely void of content, a characteristic most of your logic suffers from.

&gt; So the US puts al jaafari in the interim government as a vice president, and then miraculously the shia country elects the shia person the US promoted into political leadership.

Jaafari is a member of the [Dawa party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Dawa_Party), which is beholden to Iran and represented the Shia, which are the majority in Iran.

&gt; Please join the CSIS International Security Program for a panel discussion of the Marine Corps’ force restructure initiative “Force Design 2030.” This initiative, described in a series of documents, emphasizes disaggregated forces operating inside an adversary’s weapon engagement zone, working closely with the Navy, and adding extensive reconnaissance/counter-reconnaissance capabilities. These “stand-in forces” would be light, mobile, and armed with long-range precision strike weapons. Some of the changes―such as the elimination of tanks, reduction in the number of tube artillery units, and cuts to rotary-wing aviation― have raised concerns that the Marine Corps is backing away from its traditional focus on combined arms and global engagement.

------------------

Moderating the panel is CSIS Senior Advisor Mark Cancian. Members of the panel include the Honorable Robert Work, former Deputy Secretary of Defense, the Honorable Dov Zakheim, former Undersecretary of Defense (Comptroller), Gen Anthony Zinni (Ret), former commander, Central Command (CENTCOM), and LtGen Paul Van Riper, former commander, Marine Corps Combat Development Command.

There was a post recently about the USMC Force Design 2030, it had several articles linked within it including the Jim Webb opinion article that is talked about in the discussion. 

https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/un860l/force_design_2030_may_2022_update_and_overview/

It is interesting to watch the debate as it gives you a sense of where the people in the debate are coming from. In my personal opinion I find the argument of doing what is best for your branch a terrible argument. As the purpose of serving one's country is that you are serving the country, and not a tax funded social group that you carve out at the detriment to your nation's security. So to be honest about my own biases I must admit that some of the speakers turned me off with that line of reasoning. You can judge for yourself.

The wargaming results being fundamental to the ongoing plan is something that I find very interesting as a decision making guide, although we cannot get the results and analyze them. The offer to have the retired generals in opposition to Force Design 2030 participate in the wargame as was talked about would not work, as they have already declared their opinions and would not be impartial. 

The argument about not having enough artillery guns with their ability to launch illumination rounds, seemed odd as the plan does retain a sizable amount of artillery, it just reduces the total number while adding rocket artillery in equal number. This does not look like an abandonment of artillery in the same way that tanks was abandoned. 

One of the most radical parts of Force Design 2030 is the tactic of living within the budget given to the military branch. The commandant wanted to make changes to the way his force was designed and intended to operate, so he cut the things he didn't need and added things he did with the money left over. In previous eras I could see this being a major fight in and with congress to get the additional funds needed, and would likely be left in limbo for years. I can see the purpose of cutting major parts of the service to add what was needed, and avoiding a fight over budgets, as being the most revolutionary thing about the program.",a6256dd9e5852c39919207591b48f593ffcc5b36,True,False,,,,,0,1652884063,,0,{},i92sayn,True,t3_usdorp,False,True,t3_usdorp,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/usdorp/on_the_future_of_the_marine_corps_assessing_force/i92sayn/,1652884081,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652855263.0,

&gt;Yeah there we go. no benefit at all.

In the US the average parole board won't consider releasing prisoners until they demonstrate acceptance of responsibility for their crimes. (Unfortunate for the wrongly convicted.) So this guy would be getting a good head start on that theory.

He also has a pretty good case for leniency, considering his position relative to an average murderer. He was in a war, which is a chaotic, high pressure situation. He was apparently following orders from a superior, which is not a defense but is mitigating. He will have a large nation likely lobbying the Ukrainian government for his release, whether in 20 years or sooner. He presumably doesn't have a prior criminal record.

Yes, but currently they are still almost entirely fighting with the 150-200k professional army they had at the start of the conflict, with the exception of some reserve reinforcements of those units.

The idea of their big mobilisation, which has been ongoing all this time, has been to add roughly another 200k to that force in terms of new mobilised, trained and (lightly) equipped units.

I thought there was a general understanding that, yes, when the Russian military has a major offensive Ukraine would inevitably lose some ground. That, in fact, it was the explicit UA strategy to slowly cede such ground in a way that maximises Russian casualties and minimises UA casualties.

I thought the main objectives in this offensive were essentially not to get encircled and lose a large chunk of forces, to grind down the Ru military, and then when they finally get ground to a halt... to mount a counter-offensive to retake ground using reserves currently being trained against exhausted Ru forces forced into a hasty defense.

Losing a few towns on the front line between the peak of the offensive, and the start of any counter-offensive, perhaps even losing Sverodonetsk (if to a frontal assault, if not an encirclement), was always a likely outcome of this plan.

On this basis, I am not really concerned about Lyman or any land North of the Donetz river, that land was designated in the strategy to be slowly ceded in order to maximise Ru casualties. I'm already impressed that UA hasn't yet been forced to cede all of it.

The advance from Popansa is more concerning, as it may lead to an encirclement, but is currently proceeding only slowly. The real concern here would be if it speeds up such that it may complete an encirclement in the couple of weeks left remaining before Ru is exhausted.

A successful crossing of the Donetz would also be concerning, but they've tried and failed and taken heavy casualties in the attempt so far which (again) was the point of this strategy (to force them to take heavy casualties).

If this offensive culminates with no encirclement, then its a success. Probably a major/unqualified success if they still hold Sverodonetsk, and a minor/qualified success if they lose it to Sverodonetsk to a frontal assault.

At that point it would be a successful defense against the Russian offensive.

Whether any counter-offensive succeeds will then be up to making that leg of the stratregy a success. 

But if Ru grind themselves to a halt at the Donetz and a fair chunk of the Donbas remains in UA hands, the Ru offensive was a failure on its own terms. Ru will have failed to achieve their stated objective of ""taking back the whole of Luhansk/Dontesk Oblasts"" and it appears that UA may well have ""driven them out of Kharkiv Oblast"" in addition to that.",8e8e35188d5b3696825d55c06d2ac46fc18bd20f,True,False,,,,,0,1652879841,,0,{},i92j4dt,False,t3_usb7wn,False,True,t1_i92dgxe,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/usb7wn/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_18_2022/i92j4dt/,1652879859,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652851041.0,

I truly don’t understand what Russia is aiming for, it just seems they’re fight just to “not lose” or more like “not get embarrassed”  they don’t have the deniability they had before with the 2014 donbass invasion, it’s clear this is just naked land grabbing, what use is it to them?

The west foiled their false flag attempts and unlike Georgia in 2008, using heavy shelling and attacking relentlessly didn’t get Ukraine to take the bait and move in their army so Russia  had to go in with an unprovoked invasion.

So how is this if any use strategically?  It’s such a self destructive pursuit.

Part of the reason the deniability even worked is because of the political situation and interests meant western politicians didn’t even want to acknowledge the ongoing invasion of donbass for years even though they obviously knew, people like Phillip karber and advisor showed detailed PowerPoints of all the echelons of Russian  regular forces permanently stationed there.

But leaders didn’t scream and make a fuss about it because it was preferable not to highlight it and have to upset the status quo, so nobody made big speeches and called for extreme action.

Now the west is united, the idea of limiting ukraines ability to fight back ( refusing to even let them buy weapons) and forcing them into accepting territory being swallowed up and facilitating a farce like putins prior  to engineered conflict goal of the disgusting Minsk proposal is over.. they can’t just set up more peoples republics and spotlight will be on them if they try do that and more BS like handing out Russian passports and making life difficult if you don’t have one like in crimea.

If they set up any more peoples republic I wouldn’t be surprised if the west finally just calls them something like “ RAADD” ( **Russian Annexed Areas of Desired Deniability**) the unity is there to see it through and call out the naked war mongering imperialist actions.

Really, the fate of the Donbass battle rests on 2 things at this point, imo:

1.	How far does this new Russian attack get before it culminates?
2.	What is the state of Ukraine’s reserves, and what can it commit to the battle at the culmination point?

If Russia’s attack manages to snuff out the defenses of everything east of Slovyansk/Kramatorsk, then I think the frontline becomes far too condensed for any counterattack, and it becomes a grinding attritional affair that Russia finally isn’t horribly positioned for.

That's not 'why it started'. But yes, the long drought coupled with Turkey significantly reducing water supply into syria through their own hydro projects did play a large role in stirring discontent.

The protests started off in earnest because the police raped and murdered a boy leading to demonstrations and then assad made a frankly moronic public statement which just inflamed tensions and caused everything to go to shit.

&gt; Assad hardly lifted a finger in help and Iran sent nothing but weapons, while the west you keep blaming poured millions in food.

I can find no evidence of food aid pre-crisis beyond aid to iraqi refugees (presumably that's someone else's fault too).

Also i'm not 'blaming the west'. I'm saying they're not innocent like you are claiming in your absurd refusal to take any responsibility.

&gt; Your analysis is exactly blaming NATO for the war in Ukraine. You're blaming the west for mass starvation and Assad's massacres and torture of children.

lmao no i'm not

&gt; Yes, Russia supporting a dictator in the massacres of hundreds of thousands of civilians. Ethnic cleansing and massacres of entire villages, torture and execution of tens of thousands of civilians, intentionally bombing civilians, blockadnig and starving entire towns and using chemical weapons against civilians is orders of magnitude worse than the worst the US did in Iraq.

Why are you deflecting so much?

&gt; You seem to think being a dictator grants you unlimited rights to abuse your own population in the most gruesome ways. You must have supported the Saudi blockade of Yemen in support of the government of a soverign state just as much, right?

Again... what?

&gt; False, the US does not control Ukraine. Zelenaki did not swear fealthy to Biden, the Ukrainian armed forces were not created by the US and do not claim to fight for the US. The Jihadists Iran used to attack the US are organizations directly under Iranian command and were formed by Iran.

&gt; Suleimani was not an enemy leader, he was an enemy soldier, conducting an operation in attack against US forces. Killing enemy soldiers during their military actions against yourself is exactly what you do.

Again what? This has basically nothing to do with the points made.

Also once again you seriously lack self awareness and the ability to objectively analyse things.

&gt; Ignorance? The Iraqis literally elected a leader of a Shia Jihadist organization beholden to Iran as their first leader.

Amazing. So the US puts al jaafari in the interim government as a vice president, and then miraculously the shia country elects the shia person the US promoted into political leadership.

Yeah mate. no role whatsoever

I did not say they were ""symbolic victories"", you did. In fact, especially after the so-called Damanski/Zhenbao battle, the US was able to leverage the diminished status of the USSR in the SALT talks (Nixon/Brezhnev) and it was instrumental in revising US estimates of the Zprc In it's strategic tussle with the USSR. It has also been argued that this also lay the foundations for the rapprochement between the US and the PRC during the Nixon administration. So, yes, the PRC benefitted greatly from the Sino-Russian border conflict both in terms of territory but also strategically as it was able to reposition itself into a position of relative advantage vis-a-vis the USSR (which, as I am sureyou know, by then was considered to be a ""revisionist"" communist power).

What was million of square miles in possibly disputed territory turned into a delineation matter of where the middle of a river lies, which by itself represented a significant Chinese concession.

But my point is really that tactical developments in Donbas (or elsewhere at the moment for that matter) do not really matter, as they are not going to bring upon any shifts in the strategic developments. This could have been different, if for example in mid-April Russian forces around Izjum had managed a 30 km/day breakthrough for example. Even though I considered it extremely unlikely (bordering impossibility), there was a chance and this could have substantially changed the strategic situation.

Now, however, it is clear there will be no grand breakthrough or encirclement and the implications of tactical developments in Donbas will have very limited strategic impact.

* Will the West provide subsidies to developing nations to blunt the impact of higher energy / food prices?

I don't think that's actually helpful. The demand is mostly fixed, but supply has reduced. There is now greater competition for food - giving those with few resources more resources specifically for the scarce goods will probably just lead to those goods rising in price. It's a bit 0-sum-ish.

* Will there be incentives to participate in the sanctions program against Russia? (And no, saying ""to deter /punish Russian invasion"" or ""uphold the rules based order"" isn't really an incentive)

How about 'hey, they're disrupting your food supply, that's a direct attack in your food securtity - would you perhaps be willing to participate in punishing them?' 

* How much damage should we expect the global south to soak up? Will that impact the US' pivot to China and the building of partnerships in south east Asia? Will the US be willing to absorb some damage itself? 

Again, how would Western nations go about absorbing that damage in their stead? The only thing I can imagine making a difference is some massive food supply program, with giant logistical hurdles that haven't changed since the African famines in the 90s.

And yes, maybe that's necessary - but the West isn't going to unilaterally volunteer to start such a program when all these nations are acting like 'huh, that Russia/Ukraine thing, how about that? Not our problem though'. As you say, they don't really care.

So a few companies have come out with fancy Electronic Warfare jamming systems for radio controlled drones, and now PEOPLE THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FUCKING MILITARY EXPERTS ARE ALL ACTING LIKE ALL DRONES WILL ALWAYS BE RC FUCKING CONTROLLED.   


And that is of course, fucking absurd. You can control the god damn drone with something more sophisticated than an RC controller, and if you do, those RC jamming systems aren't going to work.   


Generally, Drones with military grade communications equipment should be at least as resistant to jamming as any mobile man carried piece of communications equipment employed by soldiers. I say ""at least as"" resistent because most military drones are likely to be at least semi-autonomous (like the switchblade).   


But this belief that drones are all easy targets that are weak to electronic warfare attack, its out there, everyone seems to believe it, and its not true. Its like everyone has a D&amp;D card in their head for drones that says ""takes + 5 damage from electronic attack"".   


It frustrates me to see this shit thrown around EVERYWHERE drones are brought up, because this kind of shit might fool a few non technical people, but it shouldn't have fooled the entire god damn military establishment. I think its become a myth that's brought up everywhere drones are brought up. I can imagine innovative defense contractors trying to sell autonomous drones and having to explain to people in charge of purchasing decisions that their autonomous or semi-autonomous drones aren't going to be obsoleted by any enemy with access to ""electronic warfare"" capabilities.",50bd938ba167355151a1f02f96cbc8c9ab606360,True,False,,,,,0,1652857622,,0,{},i91p7cx,False,t3_uqvuss,False,True,t3_uqvuss,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uqvuss/why_drones_have_not_revolutionized_war_the/i91p7cx/,1652857637,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652828822.0,

You have to remember that programs in trouble sells far more news papers than normal hiccups, and it is not all uncommon for the faults available to be hyped up to fit a narrative. It always reminds me of baking in front of a hostile crowd, where every bit of wasted flour is pointed out as a sin indicative of your poor character and competence. 

This paper though is from RUSI who have taken the time to study the program and have written it up with more authority and less pressure to exaggerate the problems. 

The points about the lack of experienced industry players in building ground vehicles in the UK is something that is often talked about as the *industrial base*. But just as often ignored as being boring or as gifts to defence contractors. The US keeping the M1 Abrams orders on a steady boil even when new tanks were not requested by the Army is something that used to get talked about frequently in the US. But rarely do the consequences of letting these companies die get mentioned. The problems with the Ajax program is a great example of why these things must be properly balanced as they are national assets. 

---------------------

Introduction:

This Emerging Insights paper provides an interim analysis of how and why this situation has come about. 

It argues that the plight of the programme must be understood in the context of over 15 years of British Army and Ministry of Defence (MoD) failure to follow through on armoured vehicle projects, resulting in a loss of expertise in both the industrial and governmental sectors. It also confirms that the MoD, the Army customer, the procurement body and industry have all contributed to the programme’s shortcomings. The paper identifies four preliminary lessons. 

First, it underlines the necessity for government to maintain a drumbeat of orders if it wishes to maintain a national industrial capability in a sector. 

Second, if government runs down its in-house expertise, it must rely on corporate claims about what is possible in a period of time for a fixed sum of money. Yet, especially in a competitive context, companies can be driven towards excessive optimism in their offers. 

Third, when projects involve an extensive development and production effort, a team approach that brings together suppliers, procurement bodies and customers is likely to work better than arms-length relationships. 

Fourth, looking for individuals and bodies to blame does not incentivise transparency and effective lesson identification and learning. 

The paper recommends that the planned inquiry focuses on holding to account individuals who were involved not only in recent years but also from the start of the programme, requiring them to identify the decisions they took. There is a need to understand the pressures that directed them to behave as they did so future acquisition programmes can be managed differently. The paper includes key questions for all the parties involved. 

Many defence budgets overrun their schedules and budgets, and do not fulfil all their requirements. However, it is rare for an order to go into production that is unacceptable to its customer. 

------------------------

&gt; * Three elements were initially reported: that it generated unacceptable levels of vibration; noise coming through headsets caused physical damage to the crews; and the gun did not fire with reliable accuracy. 

&gt; * Knowing how a system fails to perform does not explain precisely why, and, in engineering terms, this remains an Ajax mystery at the time of writing. 

&gt; * By 2010, the Army had an urgent need for a replacement reconnaissance vehicle, having failed consistently to pursue that capability for more than 15 years. At the same time, the Army’s wider procurement behaviour and failure to push projects through to the production stage had led to a diminution of British industrial interest and capability. 
&gt; * As has been officially explained, the reason for choosing this powerful weapon was its enhanced lethality in a more demanding battlefield: it could fire one shot to get the effect (or better) of three rounds fired from a 30mm cannon.20 

&gt; * In 2021, the scale and nature of Ajax’s problems became clearer and the project emerged as a potential defence and industrial disaster. As with most complex projects that go seriously wrong, clearly identifying the causes is difficult.26 

&gt; * From 2014, the MoD – and DE&amp;S, in particular – must have known that there was risk in the programme. Applying concurrency after 2014 (namely, conducting significant development27 activity at the same time as launching production) is widely understood in defence as a hazardous approach. 

&gt; * Concurrency is also quite counter to the knowledge- based, staged approach to acquisition long advocated by the US General Accounting Office and accepted in principle by the US Department of Defense.31 Significantly, the US had accepted a lot of concurrency in its F-35 programme, which was also marked by delays.32 

&gt; * The Army’s record of exploring and abandoning projects back into the late 1990s presented urgency that likely increased the MoD’s appetite for concurrency risk. 

&gt; * The MoD’s treatment of the financial risk was to transfer it, in order to get the contractor to accept a firm price contract. This was a contrast with the F-35 programme across the Atlantic, where Lockheed Martin negotiated annual price increases with the Pentagon for at least seven years after production began. The MoD also ensured that, while its contract was with GDUK, ultimate responsibility for delivery lay with its US owner. The GD parent, the fifth-largest defence business in the world, could be relied on to have available finance to cover any extra costs. 

&gt; * With the benefit of hindsight, it can also be seen that what the MoD and the contractor saw as a cost and risk reduction measure (using an established platform) appears in practice to have enhanced risk. The basic approach was to integrate a new turret with a new gun system, compared with that developed by Nexter in France, a multitude of sensors and enhanced protection on to the Spanish ASCOD/ Pizaro platform.35 

&gt; * To summarise, it appeared at the end of 2021, and remained the case in March 2022, that GDUK believed they had delivered according to their contract, something that the MoD did not accept. 

&gt; * they had made credible commitments centred on their exploitation of the ASCOD. However, it is also relevant that GDUK had never before developed or made a tracked armoured vehicle and LMUK, built on its acquisition of Insys which had in turn been a management buyout from Hunting Engineering, had not developed a turret. 

&gt; * …by 2010, the MoD had very little choice if it wanted a UK company. In light of the Army not having placed an order for a UK combat vehicle since 1994,57 the firms that previously supplied armoured vehicles, and particularly tracked systems, had given up on the defence sector and sold up where they could. 

&gt; * No armoured vehicle company could be expected to maintain, let alone enhance, its development capability for such a period without orders. 

&gt; * …there is also the possibility of a protracted legal battle between an MoD seeking to recover wasted funds and a defence company claiming that cancellation was not justified because GDUK had not breached the terms of the contract. 

&gt; * However, a British project whose output is simply not fit for basic purpose because of threats to its operators is a rare occurrence. 

&gt; * If the Ajax vehicle were to be cancelled, it would be an even bigger financial disaster than the AEW Nimrod, on which over £1 billion had been spent at cancellation point (around £3.2 billion at today’s prices).64 So far, the MoD has paid GDUK £3.2 billion against the 2014 contract worth £5.5 billion. Given the four areas that are currently seen as potential sources of vibration and noise, their re-engineering remedies – if they exist – will certainly involve GD in major expense and losses. If they cannot be fixed, GD could pursue the MoD for damages if the company could show it had not legally breached the terms of the contract. However, the MoD could claim at least some of its money back and pursue liquidated damages. Only lawyers will smile at these possibilities. 

&gt; * It should not be overlooked that, when a project underperforms, it may be that it was poorly managed by the delivery agent, but it may also be that the requirement, timetable and budget combination was unrealistic in the first place. 

&gt; * In the case of Ajax, it appears the users got significantly involved only just before delivery. 

&gt; * However, as seen, the Ajax project was shaped by many groups and decision- makers, and its problems arise from a range of factors and players.

The Argun River - 413 islands and islets along the river were disputed. The final apportionment has 204 islands in Soviet territory and 209 islands in Chinese territory. In 2004 another island was acceded to the PRC.

The Amur River - Of the 1,680 islands along the Amur, the agreement now recognizes 902 Chinese islands and 708 Russian islands.

The Ussuri River - Of the 320 islands along this river, the agreement recognizes 167 Russian islands and 153 Chinese islands.

Lake Khanka - Approx 3kms of territory was yielded to the Chinese.

The Suifen River - The islands along this river, particularly in its delta, were given to the PRC.

The Granitnaya River - The Russians handed over almost 3.5 square.miles to the Chinese.

The Tumen River - Approx 3 square miles were transferred to the PRC but local Soviet and later Russian officials objected to this given the perception that China would have access to the Sea of Japan and would reduce the importance of Vladivostok. In 1997, the Russian agreed to divide the territory into half and share with the PRC accordingly.

In addition to this there were also other agreements with the Russian at the DRPK, Russia (USSR) and PRC border (the so-called junction area).

So these are hardly ""symbolic victories"".

&gt;I personally can see why Indian planners want more buffer in that area, the boundary line is a stone throws away from Indian heartland in Northern India and New Delhi is a front line city.

This is clearly a view of someone who does not know the geophysical and historical aspects of India. New Delhi has been a so-called ""frontline city"" long before the Chinese threat became apparent to Indian planners considering that the distance between Delhi and Lahore is ~263 miles and that a missile (with or without a nuclear warhead) will take ~7 mins to hit its target. Equally, Indian planners also remember the so-called ""mapcap venture"" of Muhammed-bin-Tughlak who moved his capital dr Delhi to Daulatabad (though Hyderabad would probably have been a better choice) for precisely this reason (Delhi being a frontline city). Of course, in an age of ICBMs and hypersonic missile systems with extended ranges, the location of one's cities has pretty much become irrelevant.

&gt;India inherited a worse political set up in Tibet than Russia got in Mongolia.

The Indian position on Tibet was effectively squandered by Nehru (during the heydays of his pro-China policy). This has been very well documented in numerous scholarly outputs.

&gt;Still, India focusing on ground forces in that area probably is beneficial to China given China is much more worried about the Indian ocean and its impact on shipping into China.

You really should look up how India is reorganising it's comprehensive military posture. And it is a misnomer that India is not focusing on its maritime role. Read Pannikar to understand the basic ideas of how Indian planners are conceptualizing the peninsular nature of India's subcontinental position.

That's the game isn't it, I dunno if it was you specifically, probably was but everyone was saying the fall of Kyiv was inevitable, encirclement of the troops in the ATO was inevitable.

You can check the Xinhua archives, probably buried somewhere, but I think this one was 2005, so much more ancient and a different time. The 2011 one looks like the same position but updated for the fact that G4(India, Japan, Brazil, Germany) seek to all obtain a permanent seat in the UNSC while supporting each other's bid. You can't expect China to back a package deal that involves Japan given the complicated relations between the two.

&gt;This is not gone unnoticed in Beijing who must be congnizant of the fact that their leverage over India using Pakistan is being diminished.

Beijing is not solely using Pakistan for leverage against India, Beijing's consideration is much wider given the increased contact with Pakistan.

&gt;As is well known, the USSR yielded a lot more to the PRC than the other way around (which, as a side note, also conveyed to the US that the USSR could be contained by the PRC).

That is not necessarily true, not after the collapse of the USSR, China in general only got symbolic victories(which are important, like an island in the middle of a river), but in return recognises the effective boundary that the Russian Empire imposed and USSR inherited and Russia(plus the resulting Central Asian stans) received. Contrast that with the Russia-Japan impasse over those islands that were close to getting a solution in Japan getting some territory back to settle the whole matter only to be frustrated by Washington.

&gt;Of course the PRC would be concerned about the Dalai Lama and the future of Tibet. And of course it is fortifying it's transport and logistics systems in the area. But the greater threat for India is the potential loss of Arunachal Pradesh and the vulnerability that the ""chicken's neck"" creates for Indian planners. 

I personally can see why Indian planners want more buffer in that area, the boundary line is a stone throws away from Indian heartland in Northern India and New Delhi is a front line city. India inherited a worse political set up in Tibet than Russia got in Mongolia. British India tried tirelessly to make Tibet into an Inner/Outer model like Mongolia today(Outer Mongolia is the country bearing the name and Inner Mongolia is a province of PRC), but failed unlike the Russians with respect to Mongolia. However, China will never accept anything close to that model and Mongolia is the exception given its long history of splitting off(there are also tribal reasons given while both Mongolias are homelands of ethnic Mongolians, they in fact belong to a different set of tribes and the split was relatively clean on basis of Mongolian tribe/horde). Still, India focusing on ground forces in that area probably is beneficial to China given China is much more worried about the Indian ocean and its impact on shipping into China.",661ab2f150463735663470efc5077834ff1a7d24,True,False,,,,,0,1652841114,,0,{},i90zi1c,False,t3_urlqy9,False,True,t1_i90vah6,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/urlqy9/chinas_evolving_strategic_discourse_on_india_from/i90zi1c/,1652841129,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652812314.0,

Potential $500 million deal would put India near Israel, Egypt
India is the largest buyer of Russian made military hardware

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-17/us-seeks-to-wean-india-from-russia-weapons-with-arms-aid-package

The US is preparing a military aid package for India to deepen security ties and reduce the country’s dependence on Russian weapons, people familiar with the matter said. 

The package under consideration would include foreign military financing of as much as $500 million, according to one person, which would make India one of the largest recipients of such aid behind Israel and Egypt. It’s unclear when the deal would be announced, or what weapons would be included. 

The effort is part of a much larger initiative by President Joe Biden’s administration to court India as a long-term security partner, despite its reluctance to criticize Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, according to a senior US official who asked not to be named.  

Washington wants to be seen as a reliable partner for India across the board, the official added, and the administration is working with other nations including France to make sure Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has the equipment it needs. While India is already diversifying its military platforms away from Russia, the US wants to help make that happen faster, the official said.

The major challenge remains how to provide India major platforms like fighter jets, naval ships and battle tanks, the official said, adding that the administration is looking for a breakthrough in one of these areas. The financing package being discussed would do little to make those types of systems -- which can cost billions or tens of billions of dollars -- more affordable, but it would be a significant symbolic sign of support. 

India’s Foreign Ministry didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Officials at the State Department and US embassy in New Delhi didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. 

India is the world’s largest buyer of Russian weapons, although it has scaled back that relationship of late. Over the past decade, India has bought more than $4 billion worth of military equipment from the US and more than $25 billion from Russia, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which collects data on arms transfers.

India’s dependence on Russia for weapons against neighbors China and Pakistan is a big reason Modi’s government has avoided criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine. As the US, Europe, Australia and Japan piled economic sanctions on Russia, India has held off and instead continued imports of discounted Russian oil.

While the US and its allies were initially frustrated with India, they have sought to woo Modi’s government as a key security partner -- including against China in the Indo-Pacific region. Modi is set to join a summit with Biden next week in South Korea. The meeting will include leaders from the Quad, a partnership between the U.S., India, Japan and Australia that has drawn criticism from China. Modi also received an invitation to join the Group of Seven leaders in Germany next month. 

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made the point about China when he spoke at a news conference in April with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Indian Defense Minster Rajnath Singh and Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar. 

“We’re doing all this because the United States supports India as a defense industry leader in the Indo-Pacific and a net provider of security in the region,” Austin said. “And we all understand the challenges that we face there. The People’s Republic of China is seeking to refashion the region and the international system more broadly in ways that serve its interests.”

Why the Aukus, Quad and Five Eyes Pacts Anger China: QuickTake

Links between the US and India have steadily deepened over the past two decades, with the two sides reaching agreements that allow for more interoperability between their military platforms. 

Backing for India is a rare point of bipartisan unity in Washington, and the Biden administration has signaled that it isn’t interested in sanctioning New Delhi over its recent decision to buy the S-400 missile defense system from Russia. Turkey’s purchase of the same system deeply damaged US ties with the NATO ally.  

Still, it remains to be seen how far India will go in accepting US military assistance. Russia has historically supplied the majority of India’s military hardware, including fighter jets and missiles, as well as almost all its tanks and helicopters. Modi’s government has told the US the alternatives to moving away completely from Russian weapons imports are too expensive, according to people familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak with the media.",1e220421beb419c6ab3e04fa56e017a8ad06827c,True,False,,,,,0,1652840641,,0,{},i90yjbk,True,t3_uqwn4u,False,True,t3_uqwn4u,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uqwn4u/general_questions_comments_pet_theories_and/i90yjbk/,1652840657,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652811841.0,

Apparently...

&gt;On 15 April 2011, China officially expressed its support for an increased Indian role at the United Nations, *without explicitly endorsing India's Security Council ambitions.* (emphasis mine)

[This is the source](https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Support_for_UNSC_India.svg). Note that the footnotes don't seem to work.

Secondly, by attaching the caveat of India not supporting Japan, in effect, China is blocking India membership into the UNSC. In that sense, the Japan argument is a convenient one for China in this context.

Third, Pakistan has ceased to be perceived as a major threat for India though the latter continues to see it as a source of terrorism and instability. Pakistan also serves, unfortunately, as a convenient whipping boy for nationalistic Indian politicians. But the objective fact is that Pakistan is an irritant and not a threat. One can see the gradual reorganisation of the Indian force structure to appreciate this. This is not gone unnoticed in Beijing who must be congnizant of the fact that their leverage over India using Pakistan is being diminished.

Fourth, the claim that 

&gt;If you were a geopolitical strategist at the end of the Cold War taking a look at the map, your bet would be China and Russia would be the ones getting into boundary disputes and not China and India

...is contestable. There is no objective reason for assuming this. In fact, this has been one of the criticisms of the Nehruvian strategy, which made that presumption and was proven to be wrong. As you already know, there are numerous reasons for the Sino-Russian agreement to address their border dispute. One key reason for this was the then Soviet assessment that while they could handle a limited nuclear war (given the nascent Chinese nuclear program), an asymmetric conventional war with China would be or could be disastrous even to the extent of threatening the Trans-Siberian railway. ([See here, for example ](https://www.cna.org/CNA_files/PDF/D0022974.A2.pdf)) As is well known, the USSR yielded a lot more to the PRC than the other way around (which, as a side note, also conveyed to the US that the USSR could be contained by the PRC).

&gt;China is probably looking ahead to the succession of the Dalai Lama and Tibet as she fortifies the transportation system towards the frontier in hoping use China's current strength to put pressure on India to settle the issue on more favorable terms to Beijing.

Of course the PRC would be concerned about the Dalai Lama and the future of Tibet. And of course it is fortifying it's transport and logistics systems in the area. But the greater threat for India is the potential loss of Arunachal Pradesh and the vulnerability that the ""chicken's neck"" creates for Indian planners. I recall being a participant of a rather interesting wargame in which Indian planners were speculating about the PRC using a trifecta of airborne troops, EMP weapons, and infiltrated ground formations through Myanmar to exploit the vulnerability of the ""chicken's neck"". One of the key Indian concerns was the potential loss of uranium and other rare earth deposits in Arunachal Pradesh and in the neighbouring states.

A third possible point could be the tempering of the Sino-Pakistani relation though that is in the context of the other two points a matter of less relevance since there are other ways available to India to balance Pakistan.

China has previously openly supported India's bid for UNSC in 2011 in better times, but the caveat is India's bid cannot be associated with Japan's, which China will oppose(with South and North Korea not far behind). In more recent times, with closer China-Pakistan relationship, the Pakistan's view on the matter is also weighing on Beijing's policy makers. Still, point 2 is something China can do and has done in the past, for the right situation. The knottier question is that UNSC reform is a touchy subject and China would need to look at the holistic situation, especially with the Ukraine conflict putting the post-WW2 settlement with the P5 UNSC into flux.  Another issue that mirrors this is the Nuclear Suppliers Group(given P5 are all nuclear weapon states), with India and Pakistan both seeking to join without signing the NPT and the US-India have a side deal on that matter already.

As for number 1, China and Russia had even more poorly delineated boundaries at the end of the Cold War. If you were a geopolitical strategist at the end of the Cold War taking a look at the map, your bet would be China and Russia would be the ones getting into boundary disputes and not China and India.

**Key Takeaways**  
  
The Ukrainian military command ordered the remaining defenders of Azovstal to surrender, likely conditionally, in hopes of returning them to Ukraine as part of yet-to-be-negotiated prisoner exchanges.  
The announcement of the likely conditional surrender generated outrage in the Russian information space and demands in the Russian Duma for laws prohibiting exchanging the surrendered defenders of Azovstal.  
Russian forces continued to make limited advances in Donbas, primarily focused on setting conditions for the Battle of Severodonetsk.

**Immediate items to watch**  
  
Russian forces will likely complete their withdrawal from the vicinity of Kharkiv City but attempt to hold a line west of Vovchansk to defend their GLOCs from Belgorod to Izyum. It is unclear if they will succeed.  
The Russians will continue efforts to encircle Severodonetsk and Lysychansk at least from the south, possibly by focusing on cutting off the last highway connecting Severodonetsk-Lysychansk with the rest of Ukraine.",330e661fd098b8af48383942783e2dcd22d28c7a,True,False,,,,,0,1652832432,,0,{},i90h4of,False,t3_urktur,False,True,t3_urktur,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/urktur/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_17_2022/i90h4of/,1652832443,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652803632.0,
