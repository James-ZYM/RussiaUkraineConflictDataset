In order for there to be a negotiated end to the conflict, you would need for at least one side to conclude that the costs of continuing the war would no longer be worth the expected gains.

[],False,,octaviosiepi,,,[],,,,text,t2_2tkxlk64,False,False,"The thing is that the UK and France had been unified kingdoms for much longer and therefore had become empires much earlier than Germany, allowing them to take most of the colonies in Africa and Asia.
Russia had no overseas colonies but was a huge empire that had expanded east to the border with China and Korea.
That's why Germany was always going to be more agressive if they wanted to compete with the other great powers. If they wanted a similar share of the cake they had to build a navy to compete with the british.
They developed a land army that was more modern and stronger than the french or the russian ones but they didn't have time to develop a stronger navy. That along with their geographic disadvantage of not having direct access to the ocean meant they were easily blockaded.
When it comes to Russia it was also doubtful they could defeat them. While the German army was more modern and prepared, the sheer vastness of the Russian empire and its much bigger population meant Germany couldn't really defeat them in a prolonged war either, just in a succesful blitzkrieg attack which failed in both wars.
Basically Germany as a new power wanted the same position of privilege as the other great empires but could never build a navy comparable to the british (plus disadvantage of no open access to the ocean) and didn't have the territory and numbers of the russians. The only enemy they really surpassed in everything waa France and that's why they could defeat them in 1940 and would have been able to do so in 1914 if the british army hadn't also been deployed to France in huge numbers.

Bismarck wanted the triple alliance to be Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia and he was very much right. If this alliance had prospered it would have meant Germany would only have to fight in the West against UK and France.

1. If you actually followed Chinese politics or history since the Mao era you'd know that the century of humiliation plays a strong roll in Chinese propaganda and is still brought up in discussion when dealing with foreign affairs
2. History has shown multiple times make wars can be the catalyst for shifts in political power.  The humiliation that Russia and Germany faced at/before WW1 lead to the rise of the Soviet Party and Nazi Party.
3. The wars of Vietnam and to a lesser degree Afghanistan/Iraq saw a change in political parties in the US government.
4. The CCP relies on strong nationalism for political support by the people. But this can be a double edge sword as if there was a defeat the people would demand a change in leadership or to a possible further extreme, party.
5. China is a one-party government with no valve to relieve public discontent, there is no one to blame for a loss but the party.

Yes they still had nuclear weapons, but in a scenario where the collapse of communism is more chaotic and violent, it's possible that NATO would have invaded in order to secure said weapons from dangerous warlords and radicals.

Negotiations with the West during the Gorbachev era helped pave the way for first a relaxing of the conflict, and then essentially a soft surrender that NATO promised not to immediately exploit. NATO instead traded a greater degree of stability in especially Russia for not simply taking full advantage of the economic and cultural victory they had won.

This was likely the safest course of action for the West, but it probably wasn't the only one either. If Gorbachev hadn't come to power as a reformer, or if the 1991 coup had succeeded, it's possible that things play out differently.

It is easy enough to understand Putin's lust for Ukraine both ideologically and strategically, and all wrapped up within a Trump-like slogan of making Russia great again. But I suspect there is a great deal of granularity to his thinking. In that regard, one strategic aspect of the current situation not discussed enough is the alternative corridor Ukraine provides for trade between China and Europe.  

As recently as January of this year, just before Putin's trip to Beijing, Chinese president Xi Jinping raised the importance of this corridor in a note to Ukraine’s President Zelensky, stressing the importance of the development of the China-Ukraine strategic partnership to China's new ""Silk Road"" to Europe. 

Such a corridor threatens to compete with the main China-Europe road and rail corridor through Russia. Controlling Ukraine, or at least the Black Sea Coast littoral region of Ukraine, forestalls development of China-European economic relations through this corridor outside of Russia's control.
