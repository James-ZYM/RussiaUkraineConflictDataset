The nazis, also, were not that impressive - the US had already passed them. 

You talk like China can just roll in and fix Russia, which has been in decline for decades due to it's corrupt kleptocracy and egotistical fascist government, along with endless costly wars of expansion and oppression, saddling them only with numerous territories that would happily break away at a moment's notice.

A country that completely relies on railways for transport, with a massive failing highway system, and raw product exports to be relevant on the political stage. Like brazil. With very little ability to be self-sufficient with advanced manufacturing, and corruption throughout it's industries, and poor worker protections.

It would take decades of overhaul and a huge regime change. Russia dug their own hole, and china will need to provide more than a shovel to get them out.


Side note, nobody has air superiority in ukraine. The presence of SAMs everywhere have restricted air use by both sides to only securely controlled territory - making long-ranged airstrikes from belarusian borders and such. Russian aircraft that enter ukrainian airspace incur heavy losses and vice versa. While russia has fired a single hypersonic missile, it hardly changes the situation. Their missile success rate continues to be around 20%, due to misses and losses. 

Russia isn't flying their AWACs because they don't have the fuel, personnel, or parts.

Your second paragraph is irrelevant because we are not concerned about the status quo but we are concerned with the outcome of this military conflict. There are many reasons why the Russians may not be flying AWACS. They have won their air superiority war with Ukraine - there are drone attacks in various parts of the country but these would likely mostly succeed even with reasonable air defence coverage - that’s precisely why drones are dangerous. We know the Russians are already ahead in hypersonic missile technology. Maybe they caluculate it’s worth the trade-off for showcasing their capabilities before an upcoming air war with NATO. Maybe it’s a political strategy to discourage (stupid) talk of encouraging a no- fly zone.

Swarm and **Image** (or Reputation).  Both China and Russia relentlessly push the Image in peacetime, and weaponise it via brinkmanship. China in particular. 

The best way to deal with it is to deal with it. The Image bubble collapses very quickly when it hits Reality. We're seeing that now with Russia. We've seen it before with China (read the details of Gordon of Peking; or their more recent invasion of Vietnam). 

Japan benefited hugely in early WWII from external Image. Regarded as overwhelming &amp; dominant. It only deflated (suddenly collapsed, actually) when a tiny mob of Australians stood pat against a large Japanese attack, and wiped the floor with them. Milne Bay. First defeat of the Japanese in WWII. The news went round the Pacific forces in about 2 seconds and completely changed people's willingness to engage. And you know the result.

Re China: a useful question to consider is: since the CCP most definitely IS obsessed with Taiwan and has a history of routine military aggression _(they are currently occupying some Indian territory and much of Bhutan, in addition to the South China Sea)_, if their army WERE as good as its relentlessly trumpeted Image, they would simply have invaded and seized it years ago.

And when he's challenged by being asked (paraphrasing) why did Ukrainians only start dying when Russia arrived? He doesn't have a logical answer.

Cognitive dissonance. It's exactly what the sane people in the US have been dealing with. When trying to have rational conversations with the far right. This doesn't just show that the far right is influenced by Russia. It shows the far right is using the same exact tactics. If anyone can relate to the frustration, sadness, anger this causes Ukranians who try to get through to Russians - who cannot see through the BS - it's Americans who don't bow down to Trump. 

I will say, at least the US isn't being invaded by it's neighbors. So the situation is different. And I do not want to downplay the severity of this war and it's effects on Ukranians. And their relationships to Russians. Whether it be friends or family.

This American supports what ever it takes to get Russia out of your country. It's the least we can do. For freedom. For sovereignty. For human rights and dignity. And we must apologize for Trump's extortion of Zelensky in the middle of a hot war. I don't know if we can even make up for that. But it matters to me. And everyone I know and love that wanted Trump gone for what he did to you as a nation.

The only reason I even point out the flaw in your statement is this. We have a credibility issue in the eyes of many around the world. It's imperative that we take as credible and non hypocritical approach as possible. This will not be stopped without broad support. You would think that support would be easy to come by from other nations based on what Russia is doing, but a large number are doing their best to stay out of it and keep business relationships with both.

I still personally believe that having stations that are focused on one area is detrimental to society as a whole, just the same as social media becoming a sounding board for only your own political views. 

I think with Facebook and the ability to stealthily publish misinformation for hardly any money, and hit such a broad audience abuses the first amendment and also puts it in jeopardy as a result. 

It's a slippery slope we're riding on over the next few decades, and I think the speed at which social media is impacting political discourse is at a higher rate than we've seen from any form of communication in history.

&gt; KYIV, April 10 - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russia&amp;#039;s aggression was never limited to just Ukraine and the whole of Europe was a target as he urged the West to impose a complete embargo on Russian energy products and to supply Ukraine with more weapons.

&gt; Ukraine said it was ready for a tough battle with Russian forces massing in the east where the Ukrainian military says Russia is seeking to establish a land corridor from Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, and the eastern Donbas region, which is partly held by Moscow-backed separatists.

&gt; Russia has denied targeting civilians in what it calls a &amp;quot;Special operation&amp;quot; to demilitarize and &amp;quot;Denazify&amp;quot; its southern neighbour.

,[],False,,MisterFrog,,,[],,,,text,t2_9k4qc,False,False,"Well, I guess it depends on the vaccine. The inert ""dead virus"" vaccines are pretty safe. The ""disabled but live"" ones are probably less safe but they're all rather safe compared to the actual disease. There's always a risk with a vaccine there could be some kind of allergic reaction, but with young children, there's a chance with any new medicine of any kind they could get an allergic reaction because their constitution is unknown. But overall, I find in the studies the safety gained by the vaccine far outweigh any risks. My mom had Mumps, Whooping cough and German measles as a child and had a hell of a time with them. She didn't have them all at the same time, but she was in the hospital for them and she says they weren't sure she was going to survive whooping cough, but she did pull through. 

As far as small pox, that's a niche edge case vaccine for something so rare that we may never encounter it, although it's survival rate is so low that it did/does warrant the research with the bio-weapon risk. Chicken pox vaccine would have been great to have gotten as a kid, but I instead was exposed to actual chicken pox and the rest is history. So I now have the luxury of probably getting shingles one or more times in my life, and that can be pretty serious depending on where it pops up. 

The anecdote about vaccines ""keeping your immune system from working"" is just not true. We're constantly bombarded by all sorts of bacteria, virus, fungi at all times of the day. Our immune system is constantly working and keeping us safe, so to say we are weakening our immune system by getting a vaccine is flat out untrue.

Anyway, the vaccines are still very effective, as effective as TDAP, MMR, Chickenpox, etc. for the strain of Covid that they were designed around at the time they were created, but unfortunately Corona viruses rapidly change, so its efficacy has waned.

On the topic of the actual mRNA vaccines, this tech was first discovered and theorized decades ago and really only recently have we had the technology to be able to use it in therapeutics. Here's a bit more history (published in 2015) on the history of mRNA: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982215006065](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982215006065)

Additionally, I'm a software engineer professionally and wanted to know more how the vaccine works on a ""source code"" level so I found a really great article explaining the code of the vaccine:

[https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/?fbclid=IwAR1x868akpcdl0othrRIdmTTDQ1hkI2vCiL8X5pGJHtQ09mbO44KScHyDwo](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/?fbclid=IwAR1x868akpcdl0othrRIdmTTDQ1hkI2vCiL8X5pGJHtQ09mbO44KScHyDwo)

I'm not a biologist, but I did additional research on how DNA works to help understand it all. 

Anyway, sorry for the epic read, but hope the info helps explain a it more specifics on mRNA at least. I thought it was really interesting and this can be used in a vast number of other uses from vaccines to treatments of other types of disease, and the funding being sunken into this will surely help the whole human race if we don't blow ourselves up first in WW3.",61358374e97b1d5efef54ace374788134a190ad7,True,False,,,,,0,1649558447,,0,{},i445u33,False,t3_tzm2so,False,True,t1_i43z1iz,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/tzm2so/russian_soldiers_raping_women/i445u33/,1649558460,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1649529647.0,,,,

MMR vaccine has varying immunity for each component. The measles vs mumps vs rubella each grant the vaccinated a different level of immunity. I looked at it prior to getting it before my kids were born 9 years ago. The DTAP and TDAP for kids and adults is also not 100% effective. Vaccines also wane over time, TDAP isn't forever. But the effectiveness of vaccines through herd immunity makes a community significantly more immune than a single individual through less vectors.

A vaccine has and always will be a substance that stimulates the immune system to better handle the real disease when it's encountered. It's just ""fake it til you make it"".
