“Key Takeaways

Russian forces bisected Mariupol from the city center to the coast on April 10, isolating the remaining Ukrainian defenders in the southwestern port and eastern Azovstal Steel Plant.

Russian forces again made little to no progress in frontal assaults in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts but continue to cohere further reinforcements.

Maxar Technologies satellite imagery captured hundreds of Russian vehicles in Kharkiv Oblast redeploying to support Russian operations near Izyum.

Ukrainian counterattacks may threaten Kherson city in the coming days or weeks.”

I found this very interesting:
“Russian forces are implementing increasingly draconian measures to conscript previously ineligible personnel. The Ukrainian Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) reported on April 10 that Russian forces are now conscripting previously ineligible categories of people, including those with childhood disabilities and workers in protected industries.[3] The GUR reported that DNR/LNR authorities are enabling traffic inspectors to issue on-the-spot conscription notices and are establishing checkpoints on key highways. DNR and Russian military police are additionally reportedly destroying documents granting exemptions—such as medical records or work certificates—to forcibly conscript people.[4]”

Not surprising that the DNR is basically turning a home into cannon fodder, depopulating the region may be a Russian objective anyway.  But this will make defending Ukrainians fight to the last man. As for interior to Russia drafting, it sounds like they want to get anyone everyone they can - I wonder how much longer they can call it a special military operation?",8ad7ecacb33aa96cc17e301eeaa709c2e3116514,True,False,,,,,0,1649632317,,0,{},i4841zt,False,t3_u0g54m,False,True,t3_u0g54m,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u0g54m/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_10_2022/i4841zt/,1649632329,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649603517.0

It's all they have left in the tank and, at the end of the day, it's a good threat. Nobody wants to get nuked.

I'll also add that Karaganov is a hawk among hawks. Like genuinely, some people in this thread of called him the ideologue of Putin and that's partially true, he has had influence but he is also ridiculously stupid aggressive beyond what a lot of other Russian elite prefer. Him interviewing without mentioning nuclear weapon threats would be almost miraculous given the current situation.

Russians are having trouble advancing because they're roadboad.

There is no way to effectively ambush that because there is no way to channel them into a suitable kill zone.

The Ukraine mud season, especially in the eastern and southern Steppe terrain, still has at least a full month (if not more) to go before the warm weather dries the ground enough to ensure that tactical mobility by AFV is restored. 

But it looks like Russia is prepping for another big offensive without allowing their depleted units to reconstitute, which means they're likely to blow their wad before the mud season ends. There is no follow on forces or reserve units showing up anytime soon, what they have now is pretty much what they're going to be stuck with for the next 6-12 months. They've already suffered very heavy losses, and now they're doubling down on stupid because Putin is impatient and wants results now, which means they're still going to be attacking while roadbound, which means they'll still be easy to stop. 

If that is true, then the third phase of Russian offensives sputters out just in time for the UAF to go on the offensive while maximizing the benefits of tactical mobility after the mud season ends.",70c758a9339b5f19baf4bc9ae6fd82793120df36,True,False,,,,,0,1649620023,,0,{},i47bj83,False,t3_u0g54m,False,True,t1_i46tdn1,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u0g54m/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_10_2022/i47bj83/,1649620040,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649591223.0

The one in 2008 that was quickly shot down? Merely discussing Georgia and Ukrainian membership triggers Russia? Neither was added to MAP, but that didn't stop Russia's invasion.

&gt; They worked against it since then so that part is no revisionism.

Sorry, I should've quoted the revisionist part I was alluding to:

&gt; ""We have heard all kinds of promises by Western leaders throughout these 30 years.""

The myth of ""NATO expansionism"" promises began around the time Czechia, Poland and Hungary joined in 1999. Problem is, no written agreement was ever made, and verbal agreements were either out of context or disputed by all parties. Gorbachev even said in 2014 that the subject was never brought up by anyone during the fall of USSR and founding of the Russian Federation.

So what ""promises"" is he referring to, exactly? NATO cannot break agreements it never made nor promised. You may recall NATO and Russia were on friendlier terms, and was a PfP member- even conducting joint exercises with NATO in the 2000s. That completely disappeared in 2014- and now Russia has been trying to reframe the historical relationship as completely adversarial ever since.

For example, for a sign that a diplomatic truce may occur, I'd look for signs that Russia is taking real action to compromise. An example of that would be a halt to hostilities and Russia **not** repositioning forces for a renewed attack.

* Diplomatic Truce - Russia and Ukraine stop fighting and agree to some border.
* Russia is broken apart into sub-states and is unable to continue the war due to internal conflict
* Russia wins - takes full control of Ukraine.
* The war doesn't end - continued hostilities for years
* Ukraine wins - pushes Russia out of Ukraine returning to pre-2014 border. 
* Russia uses nuclear weapons to destroy most of the Ukraine's population
* NATO enters the conflict and eliminates Russia's ability to wage war in Ukraine.
* A nuclear exchange occurs between Russia and NATO - Destroying the capability of Russia/Ukraine to continue the conflict.
* NATO is no longer able to supply Ukraine with weapons - Diplomatically
* NATO is no longer able to supply Ukraine with weapons - Militarily 
* Support for Ukraine is withdrawn by NATO
* Russia's economy has an internal collapse and is unable to support war
* The current leadership of Russia is replaced by leadership that is not interested in war
* The people of Russia stop supporting the war in Ukraine
* The people of Ukraine stop supporting the war with Russia
* China (or other Russian ""allies"") entering the war on the Russian side
* Ukraine capitulates by surrendering
* Russia gets taken over by Ukraine militarily
* Russia is destroyed militarily by western powers and is unable to continue the war

Krauss-Maffei Wegmann offers modern artillery systems to Ukraine

German tank-maker Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) is offering a sizeable shipment of modern self-propelled howitzers to Ukraine.

The German weekly Welt, which quoted anonymous government sources in Kyiv, reported that Krauss-Maffei Wegmann offered 100 PzH 2000 (Panzerhaubitze) self-propelled howitzers to Ukraine.

According to the source, with reference to the KMW proposal, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will take place in a “circular pattern”. The Bundeswehr will provide Kyiv with 100 of its howitzers as soon as possible, and the resulting gaps will then be filled by industry in the second stage.

The first 30 howitzers KMW will be able to deliver 30 months after the signing of the contract. The delivery of 100 howitzers should also include a training package and spare parts for a total of 1.7 billion euros.

Krauss-Maffei Wegmann is a legendary defense company based in Munich, Germany. The company produces various types of equipment as well as rail locomotives, tanks, self-propelled artillery, and other armoured vehicles.

The KMW or the press service of the German Ministry of Defense has not commented on this report.",704f394f2c56ae2ae241e99e5f5d54aaffccbb6c,True,False,,,,,0,1649612441,,0,{},i46t3ky,False,t3_u0g54m,False,True,t3_u0g54m,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/u0g54m/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_10_2022/i46t3ky/,1649612452,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649583641.0

That's a strange outlook given that the chance of ""the west"" invading Russia was zero. Outside of the kinds of military planning for eventualities that militaries must do, there was zero consideration of that in western nations. There was also zero indications of preparing to do it. No  large troop build-ups or massing tanks near the Russian border, etc. The military posture of the US was not consistent with attacking Russia. Neither was the public sentiment particularly anti-Russian, although it was may have been anti-Putin.

Curious how well propaganda works. This raises a spectre though. During the cold war, USSR propaganda was largely confined to the USSR bloc nations. ""The west"", had access to western-biased but a more or less truthful press. After the rise of the internet and its weaponization by Russia against democratic socities, USSR-style ""firehose of falsehood"" propaganda is taking root and destabilizing western nations.

Russia has expended a large number of them already and it appears at this stage of the war to be one of their best assets to attacking Ukraine at depth. 

The missiles are far more expensive when looking at how much money is expended per amount of ordnance dropped on target when compared to air dropped bombs. Yes, aircraft are more expensive to buy and maintain but once you have them they are reusable for decades. Where as a ground launched missile costs millions, not thousands, to use and are gone forever once launched. 

But when looks at the costs of pilots and aircraft, and the years long lead time to replace them, in a high intensity conflict with a peer/near peer then the appeal to militaries without stealth technology makes sense. 

The unfortunate tensions and loss of life on the China/India border has had lasting negative impacts of both sides racing to increase military and infrastructure spending that they would not have undertaken otherwise. The failure to reach compromise and diplomatic solutions is negatively impacting billions of people.

Quote:

&gt; The sustained pace of Pralay’s testing likely reflects India’s intent to demonstrate a high tempo of missile activities following clashes between China and India along their disputed western border. These skirmishes increased tensions between Beijing and New Delhi. Since 2020, an ongoing and unprecedented peacetime militarisation of the Sino-Indian border has each side deploying at least 50,000 ground troops and aerial forces. China has reportedly deployed and exercised ground- and air-launched stand-off capabilities in the region, as has India in response. 

&gt; Unlike China, India has limited conventional ground-launched missile options. These revolve around the BrahMos supersonic missile co-developed with Russia. Developing the longer-range and conventionally armed Pralay ballistic missile would therefore provide New Delhi with an improved capability to hold additional targets at risk through deterrence and warfighting.

About the IISS

The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) is a British research institute (or think tank) in the area of international affairs. Since 1997 its headquarters have been Arundel House in London, England.

The 2017 Global Go To Think Tank Index ranked IISS as the tenth-best think tank worldwide and the second-best Defence and National Security think tank globally,[1] while Transparify ranked it third-largest UK think tank by expenditure, but gave it its lowest rating, ""deceptive"", on funding transparency.[2]

Mindless “drive down road, get blown up, repeat next day” tactics.  “Reinforcements” are ragtag remnants of units that were mauled in the north whose only role in Donbas will be to eat supplies.

In contrast, the UAF is being patient and methodical, and every day receives more and more advanced weapon systems from NATO and allies.  Zelensky just said that he won’t attend peace talks until the push in Donbas has been defeated.

Chinese submarine technology is generations behind, and China has minimal anti-submarine warfare (AWS) capabilities. US/UK submarines would be shooting fish in a barrel in the South and East China Sea for any Chinese ships or landing crafts. In addition, the combined geographic alliance of Taiwan, South Korea, Phillippines, and Japan would ensure any submarines China launches would be tracked and fed to the US. Japan has top tier AWS capabilities too.

Assuming any Chinese landing crafts even get to Taiwan and don't get sunk, US submarines can just launch missiles onto the very few chokepoint beaches in Taiwan and wipe out any landing force. There's practically nothing China can do.

&gt;Because China isn't going to let Western boats full of missiles and rockets and ammo dock in Taiwan after the shooting starts.

Nope. Active duty US soldiers have been stationed for years in Taiwan and it was purposely leaked to the press last year. The fact that China has swept this news under the rug and not brought any attention to it indicates that China knows they can't do anything about it and has no intentions to do anything about it. This is all you need to prove how much of a paper tiger China is.

Looking at OSINT, Ukraine doesn't seem to be significantly more stretched out than Russian forces. I get the following deployments (clockwise from Western Ukraine to Odesa):

First, the forces defending Western Ukraine and those having completed the liberation of the Kyiv approaches - 6x regular and 7x territorial defense brigades with **\~60,000 men**:

1. Ternopil: 105th Territorial Defense Brigade (April 5th - source says 114th Brigade, but probably a typo / **\~5,000 men**)
2. Kovel: 104th Territorial Defense Brigade (April 5th / **\~5,000 men**)
3. Zhytomyr: 115th Territorial Defense Brigade (April 5th / **\~5,000 men**)
4. Belarus border, NW of Kyiv: 61st Infantry and 112th Territorial Defense Brigades (April 5th / **\~10,000 men**)
5. Kyiv area: 14th Mechanized, 114th Territorial Defense and 72nd Mechanized Brigades (April 5th / **\~15,000 men**)
6. Liberated NE Ukraine: 10th Mountain Assault, 1st Tank, 119th Territorial Defense, 58th Motorized Infantry and ???th Territorial Defense Brigades (April 5th / **\~20,000 men**)

Second, the forces engaging Russian forces in and near the JFO - 15x regular and 3x territorial defense brigades with **\~75,000 men**:

1. Sumy: 117th Territorial Defense and 93rd Mechanized Brigades (April 5th / **\~10,000 men**)
2. Line between Sumy and Kharkiv: 128th Mountain Assault and 46th Air Assault Brigades (April 5th / **\~10,000 men**)
3. Kharkiv: 113th Territorial Defense and 92nd Mechanized Brigades (April 5th / **\~10,000 men**)
4. Izium: 17th Tank, 25th Airborne and 81st Air Assault Brigades (April 5th / **\~10,000 men**)
5. Sloviansk: 57th Motorized Infantry Brigade (April 5th / **\~5,000 men**)
6. Sievierodonetsk: 79th Air Assault and 111th Territorial Defense Brigades (April 5th / **\~10,000 men**)
7. Popasna: 24th Mechanized Brigade (April 5th / **\~5,000 men**)
8. Donetsk: 95th Air Assault Brigade (April 5th / **\~5,000 men**)
9. Line between Donetsk and Dnipro river: 53rd Mechanized, 1/2 of 56th Motorized Infantry and 59th Motorized Infantry Brigades (April 5th / **\~10,000 men**)
10. Mariupol (isolated): 36th Marine and 1/2 of 56th Motorized Infantry Brigades (March 31st / **\~5,000 men**)

Third, the forces pushing toward Kherson from Western Ukraine - 3x regular and 1x territorial defense brigades with **\~15,000 men**:

1. Kryvyi Rih: 60th Mechanized Brigade (April 5th - might in fact be 60th Infantry Brigade / **\~5,000 men**)
2. Mykolayiv: 80th Air Assault, 123rd Territorial Defense and 5th Tank Brigades (April 5th / **\~10,000 men**)

Fourth, the forces guarding Odesa - 1x regular and 1x territorial defense brigade with **\~10,000 men**:

1. Odesa: 122nd Territorial Defense and 28th Mechanized Brigades (April 5th / **\~10,000 men**)

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Note that there's a further \~3x National Guard Brigades engaging Russians in and near the JFO. So overall, Ukraine probably has up to **\~110,000 ground troops** currently engaging Russian forces on a front stretching from south of Sumy down to Mykolayiv, which given Russian losses and redeployment times would suggest that Ukraine at worse is tied numerically on that front, and will be able to reinforce the front with additional tens of thousands of troops in the coming days and weeks.

&amp;nbsp;

I've heard several compelling reasons why Russia might have invaded Ukraine and none (directly) involve the black sea. The first group all take as a presupposition that Ukraine was becoming increasingly west/nato aligned:

1. Ukraine being antagonistic to Russia or outright joining NATO presents a significant security risk to Russia as it drastically reduces the strategic depth during an invasion. (I'm not sure that such a threat would actually be meaningful, but it's plausible that Russians have genuine anxieties about this).
2. Senior Russian officials have some kind of panslavic fantasy and view Ukraine as rightly in Russia's sphere of influence. (A lot of senior officials do openly say as much)
3. Russia wanted to project force against Ukraine as a diplomatic tool to coerce other states into becoming Russia aligned. (Not particularly convincing)

The rest don't:

1. Ukraine has an incredible wealth of natural resources some of which have only recently become economically viable to extract. Most significant of these is natural gas because it threatens Russia's economic foundation as a petrostate. While significant natural reserves were seized with the annexation of Crimea, several large untapped fields still remain. (Very plausibly a contributing factor)
2. Military reform within Ukraine presented a realistic possibility that the separatists in the Donbass would collapse even with Russian support. The only way to prevent this was direct intervention. (I'm not really qualified enough to assess this)
3. The Ukrainian decision to dam the flow of water to Crimea created an unsustainable economic situation for Russia which was impossible to fix without military intervention. (Plausibly a contributing factor, but probably not enough to justify the decision to invade and likely could have been achieved through coercive diplomacy).

&amp;nbsp;

The black sea explanation doesn't make sense however because even controlling the full coastline of Ukraine doesn't give Russia anything that they don't already have in Crimea. Without controlling the Bosporus straits Russia can never be said to be in control of the black sea. Just look at a map of the black sea and it obviously doesn't make sense.

Gaining some kind of access to the black sea is extremely important to Russia, that much is true. It is also true that Russia will likely aim to cut off Ukraine from the black sea in order to place increasing pressure on them during negotiations due to the restricted flow of trade. That doesn't mean that the Ukranian coast is anything close to a primary strategic objective for Russia.",542b9a39002d5d79ec02e82c684022cd53ce5b54,True,False,,,,,0,1649560381,,0,{},i449nkh,False,t3_tzjtot,False,True,t1_i43wqer,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tzjtot/analysis_of_russian_operations_against_ukraine/i449nkh/,1649560395,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649531581.0

&gt; Clausewitz–or at least the version of Clausewitz that is taught in many war colleges–has bedeviled generations of students by offering several “trinities.” First, there is the relationship between emotion, chance, and reason which governs events in war. Emotion itself can be broken down as a balance between hatred, violence, and primordial enmity.  At the level of strategy, however, the trinity on which most students of Clausewitz focus is the relationship between the army, the government, and the people. In this week’s Horns of a Dilemma, a panel of three experts discusses the ongoing Russian war of aggression in Ukraine. While they didn’t set out to discuss a Clausewitzian trinity, Michael Kofman of the Center for Naval Analyses, Mark Pomar of the Clements Center for National Security, and Alexandra Sukalo, also of the Clements Center, offer insights that focus our attention exactly on these three critical elements. This discussion was moderated by Texas National Security Review Executive Editor Doyle Hodges, and was recorded on April 7, 2022.

Had he not launched a mass assault, he probably could have bled Ukraine dry and slowly eroded their independence again in the same way the initial division was sponsored from Moscow. Now Western opinion has shifted and the Ukrainian people have united to such a degree that it feels almost certain if they can win the war they will be heavily supported economically in a sort of Marshall plan.",086962e7f819b7c678deb7bac674ffd72c24ab74,True,False,,,,,0,1649550125,,0,{},i43ow8b,False,t3_tzrr3h,False,True,t1_i43nxq5,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tzrr3h/ukraine_conflict_megathread_april_09_2022/i43ow8b/,1649550140,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1649521325.0

[],False,,phooonix,,,[],,,,text,t2_2rz57lo1,False,False,"&gt; It’s a complicated issue for sure, but I don’t think NATO could ever rule out Ukraine becoming a member publicly. Doing so at Russia’s behest would effectively be handing them a veto over NATO membership and recognizing a Russian sphere of influence that overrode the sovereign decisions of those affected (in this case, Ukraine). NATO could not do the first without seriously damaging its viability as an alliance, and could not do the second without undermining the ideological rationales for expansion to begin with. You can hardly claim to have an open door policy based on democratic values and European integration and then deny membership based on the desires of an autocratic would-be overlord.

You're right, it is complicated. However, Ukraine itself could have short-circuited the whole controversy by publicly renouncing efforts to join NATO, since they already knew it was impossible.
