I'm able to understand Russias POV. The West has been acting very counterproductive and arrogant, for decades. But no need to say Russia has it's very own record, suppressing eastern europe (cause for countries running for NATO in first place), or e.g. chechnya (yes I know about the way to the 2nd one... and killing the moderate leaders was a clever move); and right now, it's pretty good in catching up. You can't condemn Kosovo while justifying the other.

The US is on it's way down anyway, future world power will be China - so the problem of Russia ""endangered"" by NATO most likely would have been resolved by time alone.

It's really sad it came to this point. Russia should have taken the separatist regions, the better for the people ruled by warlords there.

As for evidence of civilians being attacked:

Rockets from air (appears unguided given the total lack of angle adjustment after firing and need for the plane to perfectly line up), fired at civilian homes. &lt;https://twitter.com/YateeshRonija/status/1496856641249050630&gt;

Rural homes blown up by airstrike. &lt;https://twitter.com/nishatshamsi/status/1496731674104582147&gt;

Airstrike on something up in the distance, appears to be buildings. &lt;https://twitter.com/serzzzE/status/1496741914229547013?s=20&amp;t=BnhsfJPo97NlNa5GcpqwUw&gt;

Missile strike on civilian airport. &lt;https://twitter.com/ASLuhn/status/1496734064593674240&gt;

Apartment building hit by airstrike. &lt;https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineWarVideoReport/comments/t04a9l/apartment_complex_near_ukraines_kharkiv_hit_by/&gt;  
More footage of the same apartment area. Shows there were no military assets in the area. &lt;https://twitter.com/anadoluagency/status/1496743551031513092?s=20&amp;t=1WH_wlsxZPErFXb7CFz4gQ&gt;  
A survivor of that apartment building. &lt;https://twitter.com/Mi_Cuba_Libre/status/1496747180249411584&gt;

A Solnsetpek is spotted moving into Ukraine. They fire unguided rockets. I don't believe these are considered indiscriminate like an MLRS, but I'm adding because it's still unguided- therefore, not precise. &lt;https://twitter.com/franakviacorka/status/1496751495928295428?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&gt;

Lastly, and most importantly, evidence that MLRSs are used. MLRSs are *indiscriminate*. That means civilian casualties are *inevitable*. You do not fire these unless you have no problem with killing civilians. Russia is not an undeveloped or primitive nation, they have plenty of missiles capable of precision strikes. *They choose not to use them* They *choose* to cause civilian deaths.

I also believe that a big part of this conflict has nothing to do with Ukraine. Russia vs NATO and more specifically the US.

[],,,JaesopPop,,,[],,,,text,t2_oufha,False,False,"&gt;You know which question

I don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs why I asked you. Why wouldn‚Äôt you just clarify what you mean? Very odd.

&gt;You can‚Äôt say for sure that Russia will invade if NATO officially refuse Ukraine. Because no one can answer that since it didn‚Äôt happen.

Sure, but we can apply some common sense and high school lever geopolitical awareness and come to the obvious conclusion.

&gt;Bucharest summit was on 2008. It was the trigger for Russia to harass Ukraine.

Russia attempted to assassinante their presidential candidate four years prior. They were already harassing Ukraine. Learn some history please. 

&gt;NATO refuse to deny Ukraine officially even though they are not eligible anyway.

Ukraine as a country is eligible once they enact reforms. You seem bafflingly ignorant to this process despite me explaining it to you - Ukraine is continuing to add reforms that are working towards them getting approval. 

&gt;Russia attack.

Russia had already been targeting Ukraine for long before the Bucharest summit. 

&gt;Anyway this is my last response.

Because you‚Äôre a coward who cannot put together any sort of logical argument as to why Russia can protect their national security but Ukraine isn‚Äôt allowed. 

&gt;NATO can‚Äôt do shit in this situation but they also refuse to officially announce that Ukraine will not be NATO member which will save Ukraine civilian.

They refuse to ‚Äúofficially announce‚Äù it because the goal is still Ukraine joining NATO. Why would they deny them now, of all times? 

&gt;Is NATO ego outweigh Ukraine civilian lives? 

Does Russia‚Äôs ‚Äúright‚Äù to defend themselves against Ukraine joining a **defensive pact** outweigh Ukraines right to defend their national security? 

&gt;This doesn‚Äôt mean I support Russia but if by doing just that it can avert a war, why not? Because NATO doesn‚Äôt actually give shit to Ukraine.

You keep saying NATO capitulating to Putin would end the war. You have no basis for this statement.

Think for even a second - if that would end the war, then Ukraine could just declare they won‚Äôt join NATO. They‚Äôre not doing that because **Russia would keep attacking**. 

**Again, why is Russia justified in attacking Ukraine for their national security, but Ukraine isn‚Äôt justified in joining NATO to protect theirs? Why else would Ukraine want to join NATO except protection?**

Stop being a coward. You were wrong about Russia not invading unless NATO admitted Ukraine but are pretending you meant something entirely different. You refuse to name what country you‚Äôre in, pretending it‚Äôs sensitive information but it‚Äôs clearly either Russia or a state with a Russian relationship, and you refuse to answer the question I just asked.

And now you‚Äôve given your ‚Äúlast response‚Äù because you‚Äôre too small of a person to actually address what I‚Äôm saying. It‚Äôs hilarious that you‚Äôve tried to admit you‚Äôre ‚Äúa man‚Äù. The only people who insist on that are cowards like you trying to convince themselves. 

I hope you sleep well thinking every dying Ukrainian is justified because Russia is allowed to defend themselves from Ukraine defending themselves from Russia, comrade.",,,,,,,,,1645724713,,,{},hy9njrw,False,t3_svu0t1,False,True,t1_hy94zk1,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/svu0t1/watch_biden_provides_an_update_on_the/hy9njrw/,,1,,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,,,,0,[],,1645695913.0,[],1653357187.0,

They get quickly detained. [https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/02/24/dozens-of-russian-anti-war-picketers-detained-reports-a76559](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/02/24/dozens-of-russian-anti-war-picketers-detained-reports-a76559)

I'm from Russia, living in the US. My evaluation is that the reasonable Russians are tired of corruption, economical issues, COVID, etc., etc., and so they are more focused on their own lives. There's little unity, so basically you don't have anyone you trust to riot with.

Also, the Nazi sentiment is somewhat real; we've heard bloodthirsty, openly anti-Russian remarks from our relatives from Kyiv since 2014, and I think there are other families that have experienced this divide. In a world with no friends, to some Putin might seem like the lesser evil. (Which I disagree with, just thinking what the sentiment might be.)

My deepest condolences to the Ukranians. I assure you that many Russians sympathize with you and feel personally responsible for the actions of our administration, it's just that we have no real voice.

No, if seen from Russian side:

3. Russia attack.

You have to tell me what question I missed if you want me to answer it, comrade. 

&gt;I don‚Äôt support Russia but I understand why they did it.

So do you understand why Ukraine wanted to join NATO? 

Also, given a number of NATO nations border Russia, why is Ukraine different?

&gt;Did you do something when US invading Iraq too, protest on the street to stop it? 

I was a teenager when the Iraq war started. Even then it became clear pretty quickly that the war was unjustified and the reason invented. Not all of us support our countries actions unquestioningly. The US has plenty of blood on it's hands. 

My point though is that per your reasoning the US was justified. 

&gt;ooo holy saint righteous man?

???

&gt;Yeah probably I wished at first. But I will regret it because they won‚Äôt allow me to join while the whole thing cause Russia to invade.

But Russia would've invaded anyways. So why blame NATO or regret trying to join?

&gt;Lol every war has civilian casualties but it was never the intention to kill civilian.

It doesn't matter what the intention is. When you engage in a war you are doing so with the understanding that there will be civilian casualties. You are choosing to accept that you are murdering those people.

&gt;And US waged war also has civilian casualties so why US allowed and Russia is not? What makes you so special?

When have I said it's acceptable for the US?

&gt;Sure I did said that. But there is no official statement if they will not join. For Russia that mens they will join. 

Yes, again, Ukraine and NATO are plainly working towards them joining. 

&gt;Because it is simple, if they won‚Äôt join then if NATO won‚Äôt announce means they are challenging Russia resolve.

No, it means they are trying to protect themselves from Russia. 

You seem to be struggling with this. Ukraine wants to join NATO to protect themselves from Russia. Let me break it down simply for you.

1) Russia is aggressive towards Ukraine and funding separatist movements

2) Due to this, Ukraine wants to join NATO

3) Russia attacks Ukraine for joining NATO.

**Russia** is the problem. They are the aggressor. If they were not actively fucking with Ukraine, they would not have wanted to join NATO in the first place.

&gt;US has murder countless in Iraq with false accusations, I won‚Äôt be surprised if they do it again if Mexico really make a pact with Russian.

So you support Russia invading Ukraine by making things up but not the US invading Iraq? Why?

&gt;You can guess where I come from as you liked. It doesn‚Äôt matter to me. I could tell you a lies and you won‚Äôt know the truth anyway.

Da, comrade.

&gt;Yes sovereign nation will be left alone if it doesn‚Äôt threaten if it is then means war for the Russian. The fuck you don‚Äôt understand?

Russia has threatened Ukraine for decades. You're saying Russia is justified by acting in the interest of their national security, but Ukraine wants to join NATO in the interest of their national security due to Russia being aggressive. 

Why is Russia allowed to murder Ukrainians in the interest of their national security, but Ukraine isn't allowed to protect themselves from Russia in the interest of theirs?

&gt;By the way missed to reply a point on a long written reddit post is part of functional human being.

This doesn't mean anything.

&gt;If I‚Äôm Ukrainian I wouldn‚Äôt be happy of course but I will blame NATO because they can simply avert the war simply by declaring that my country is not going to join NATO. 

Except if you were from Ukraine you'd want to join NATO so you'd be safe from the Russians. 

Also, you'd probably blame the people gunning down your mother and turning your family into bite sized human chunnks.

&gt;In reality it is not eligible anyway. 

That's the whole point of the process of joining NATO, to work towards eligibility. How are you so poorly educated about all this? Russian propaganda in schools?

&gt;Don‚Äôt say they want to kill civilian because they don‚Äôt it is a lie. 

They're deciding that it's worth killing civilians. 

&gt;Civilian casualties is always there in every war, even those waged by the US too.

""Well the US did it!"" isn't an excuse. 

&gt;I never run am I and I even try to reply to missed question. Stop this useless provocation. It just shows that you are frustrated and try to attack me personally.

I'm very clearly attacking you personally because you are morally inept and support the death of civilians in the name of Russia expanding it's territory. 

&gt;Yes I said sorry I don‚Äôt word it good enough. You just attacking me by my weakness in English. 

No, I would never criticize someone for their poor English, I am not even conversational in a second language so I have no place to mock someone for not knowing a second perfect. 

Rather, I'm calling you a liar. What you said wasn't poorly phrase, it was clear - Russia will not invade Ukraine unless they join NATO. You're not so bad at English that you got this mixed up with ""Russia won't invade if NATO promises not to accept Ukraine"". You're just a weak man who lacks integrity and morals.

&gt;But it is clear that the Ukraine direction is towards joining NATO. If not then just announce it officially and end the war. No announcement means the intention is there.

Yes, obviously Ukraine intends to join NATO and NATO is willing to help them get there. Russia doesn't get to tell Ukraine they can't protect themselves against Russia. And the idea that Russia would pull out if NATO capitulated is hilariously dishonest or just stupid - Russia is invading because Putin wants the territory plain and simple. You're acting like Russian propaganda is the real reason.

Again, it's this simple - you say Russia is justified because your country is acting in the interest of it's national security by avoiding having Ukraine join NATO. But Ukraine only wants to join NATO to have protection from Russia. 

Why is Russia justified in murdering Ukrainians by protecting their national security, but Ukraine isn't justified in joining NATO to protect theirs from Russia who have been aggressive to Ukraine well before they wanted to join NATO?",,,,,,,,,1645715331,,,{},hy8ypy0,False,t3_svu0t1,False,True,t1_hy7no6d,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/svu0t1/watch_biden_provides_an_update_on_the/hy8ypy0/,,1,,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,,,,0,[],,1645686531.0,[],1653261759.0,

Yes sovereign nation will be left alone if it doesn‚Äôt threaten if it is then means war for the Russian. The fuck you don‚Äôt understand?

Well then don‚Äôt respond to me anymore. Good riddance I got other thing to do. By the way missed to reply a point on a long written reddit post is part of functional human being.

NATO take Ukraine I mean as member.

If I‚Äôm Ukrainian I wouldn‚Äôt be happy of course but I will blame NATO because they can simply avert the war simply by declaring that my country is not going to join NATO. In reality it is not eligible anyway. I will be mad because I get caught between two opposing superpower due to NATO ego.

No Russian is not justified to kill civilian. But they apparently they think they are justified to take over the territory. Don‚Äôt say they want to kill civilian because they don‚Äôt it is a lie. They just want the territory. Civilian casualties is always there in every war, even those waged by the US too.

I never run am I and I even try to reply to missed question. Stop this useless provocation. It just shows that you are frustrated and try to attack me personally.

Yes I said sorry I don‚Äôt word it good enough. You just attacking me by my weakness in English. But it is clear that the Ukraine direction is towards joining NATO. If not then just announce it officially and end the war.

&gt;I will not be so sure with your answer. If Mexico allow Russian to install radar there it means they declare themselves as US enemy. If not doing prevention like what Russia doing and even if not immediately but eventually US will attack **even not by means of war. **

Whether or not a country murders people is actually pretty important.

&gt;I would not disclose my info to insignificant someone on the damn internet lol. Are you really expecting me to answer this?

Yes? I'm from the US. US is big so I'll even specify the northeast. I'm not asking for ""your info"". I'm asking what *country* you're in. That's not sensitive information, so I assume you're not actually an ""unaffected third party"".

&gt;No innocent people have to dies because NATO doesn‚Äôt want to write on paper that Ukraine will never be member and thus posed as Russian potential national security threat.

Let me be sure I understand you, because you sound like a sociopath. Because NATO did not capitulate to Russian demands, it is *their* fault that Russia is now murdering people? 

I'm pretty sure it's the fault of the country doing the murdering. Russia was not forced to murder people. They chose to. 

Was the Holocaust the allies fault because they wouldn't let up on the Treaty Of Versailles? 

&gt;For Russia yes apparently their national security outweigh the sovereignty of other country. Why sovereignty of other country outweigh Russian national security?

Because a sovereign nation literally means others don't control them? The fuck?

&gt;Oh now you believe in Putin words? 

Not really, just funny how poorly informed you are.

&gt;Yeah after they took over Ukraine he will handed it in a silver plate to NATO.

""Hand it to NATO""? Do you think NATO is a country?

&gt;Also you have no right to order me to answer in one comment don‚Äôt you know that? What if I don‚Äôt? I want to hear this please answer.

Sure I do. And if you don't, I'll ignore the other responses. Just respond like a functional human being. 

&gt;Again they don‚Äôt invade to kill civilians. 

They are killing people. 

&gt;They wanted to take over the territory rather than taken by NATO. And it is basic of survival.

NATO wouldn't take over Ukraine. You have no idea what NATO is, clearly. 

If the country next to you - so, Ukraine probably - felt your country was a national security threat and attacked your home and murdered your family, would you smile and agree they were justified? 

Also you forgot to explain how this is different than the US invading Iraq. 

So you think Russia is justified in murdering Ukrainians because they weren't able to tell them how to operate their country? Yes or no. Don't run away. Stop being a coward.

I'm a Ukrainian-born living overseas, who also spent some time living in Russia. I've got family on both sides, however the overwhelming majority is in central/eastern Ukraine.

I have no idea what to do. I talked to some of my relatives over the phone just last night and most of them are actively trying to block the developments out of their minds. Most are really worried. I'm not sure what I can do from here, except trying to raise awareness of the horrible, inhumane cancer that is putin, so I made this (helpful?) poster, outlining exactly what he is for whatever little this is worth.

It's a horrendous situation. I'm half tempted to get on a flight and try to make my way to Ukraine to join up with the resistance, but I've got no military training and no real idea on what to do. I'm supposed to be getting married in a few weeks, however this is leaving me feeling completely numb and ashamed.

I don't understand why common Russian citizens are not rioting in the streets against this war. It will be their young guys as well as Ukrainians that will be dying. And for what? So putin can fulfill this imperialist ambitions? I can only assume that it's decades of propaganda as well as fear of repercussions that will surely follow.

The invasion has been planned for a while and I am fairly sure that the original plan assumed
1) that Trump would have been still in the white house and his loyal puppet
2) that Europe would have been more interested in keeping the gas deals than condemning the invasion

Right now Putin is facing the worst case scenario, everything that could have gone wrong is going wrong, and he is by definition a strong man. His whole grip on russia is based on being relentless and projecting power.

Retreating would be a failure and likely the kiss of death for his regime, but at the same going forward is also suicidal.
Putin is likely going to have the forces to invade Ukraine, but not painlessly, especially with the shipments of weapons Ukraine is receiving, and while he might still have forces enough to defeat Ukraine in the open he likely has no hope to mantain control over it.
He was also reportedly badly advised by the crew of yes men that he sorrounded himself with who had hom convinced that Ukrainians would open their arms and welcome him as a liberator while in truth he managed to unify not only Ukraine but all of the west against him.",,,,,,,,,1645668784,,,{},hy6nhtf,False,t3_szwrvf,False,False,t3_szwrvf,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/szwrvf/is_putin_bluffing/hy6nhtf/,,7,,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,,,,0,[],,1645639984.0,[],1652954358.0,
