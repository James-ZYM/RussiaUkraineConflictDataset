So, if there are no sanctions he would probably view that as a signal that the west does not have any appetite for conflict and that he can escalate further, if the sanctions are as expected he will continue with his plans and if they are harsher than expected, most likely he will also continue, since starting an invasion and then aborting it after one day  would be a disaster. 

Now, the above is of course much too simple, it is likely that Putin is somewhat flexible in his war aims, that he can adjust plans somewhat taking into account the western response. (For example, claiming that he just wanted to secure Lugansk and Donetsk, rather than occupying the entire Ukraine.)

&gt;Schmitt’s Großraum: a conception of hemispheric hegemony in which a “völkish order of life,” an ideologically charged ethnocivilization, “radiates” its power and influence outward. 

If I was to ask the author ""How do the overseas Chinese fit into this picture?"" What would his response be? 

In 1909 the Qing Empire laid the foundation for Chinese citizenship law based it on the principle of [Jus sanguinis](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/tcc.2009.35.1.4?journalCode=ytcc20).  In the 1950s, overseas Chinese even those who were seven generations removed were considered Chinese.  Please read the history of returning overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. In the 1950s a Chinese Indonesian could travel to the PRC and become a Chinese citizen.  Hundreds of thousands did.  Now it's almost impossible for ethnic Chinese even those who were born in China and have taken up foreign citizenship to do so. Moreover, in 1955 The Sino-Indonesian Dual Nationality Treaty, the Chinese and Indonesian governments signed an agreement saying ethnic Chinese could choose to become Indonesian or Chinese. [Even if you choose to be Chinese you could still remain in Indonesia.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3023470) Meaning China at the time believed that nationality transcended national borders. Note: the Qing Empire's decision to establish the Jus Sanguiris notion of citizenship was to counter the Dutch wanting to give [Dutch citizenship to the Chinese in the Dutch East Indies](https://www.npr.org/2022/02/13/1080059720/for-some-athletes-what-is-chinese-is-not-so-simple)

Understanding this question requires understanding Chinese notions of identity from the Tang Dynasty onward. By this measure, China is moving to a more ideological form of identity and less ethnic. Why try to force everyone to learn Mandarin? if it was purely based on ethnic identity, why does a Han Chinese speaking Cantonese have to learn Mandarin? Because the concept of being Chinese has changed over time.

I am just skimming the surface, it's an incredibly complicated topic that even the Chinese scholars who quote Schmidt don't understand all the components.  This is just one example, and there are dozens more. For people without any specialized knowledge, the author seems to know what he is talking about, and many are intimidated by political philosophy.

&gt;You misunderstand: they would have actually gone to war; we would not have. I don't know why you think the Russians were bluffing; they've fought twice since 2008 (Georgia and Crimea) to prove that NATO expansion to Georgia and Ukraine is a red line that they're willing to enforce. On the other hand, Biden repeatedly said that we would not send any US ground troops to Ukraine; he even withdrew the few that were there two weeks ago.

I don't misunderstand, I disagree and think it's ludicrous to assume Putin would invade if it meant a full blown ground war with the US. Neither Georgia nor Crimea (nor unfortunately the present situation) involved the threat of an ouright war with US. And Biden not being willing to commit troops is what I'm challenging in the first place so that point just feels like you're restating the question. The reality is that neither side wants a major war over this and that that situation inherently gives an advantage to the side trying to prevent an invasion. Biden threw that advantage out the window the second he said he wasn't willing to send troops. 



&gt;That wasn't a precedent. Kyiv never had the launch codes for those nukes; the codes were always in Moscow because those were Soviet nukes that just happened to be parked in Soviet Ukraine.

So in my layman's grasp of the situation, economic sanctions and removal of Russia from SWIFT are the only major 'peaceful' deterrents left.

However, Putin knows this and has stated Russia has built up some sort of reserves/safeguarded their economy to an extent they wouldn't be affected.

I don't believe that to be the case, as I think a prolonged cut off from the world economic system would endanger the Russian people, economy, and the assets held by the oligarchs. If Putin proceeds along this route, he'd effectively hand the Russian economy over to the only people willing to trade with them (likely China), which he wouldn't be willing to do.

I don't think a European ground war is likely either. If Putin continues to take the whole of Ukraine and NATO uses all economic sanctions left to cripple the Russian economy, there is a chance Putin will threaten nukes/EMPs/a cyber attack if he doesn't get his way. This will publicly place the ball in NATO's court of agreeing to WW3/potential nuclear warfare - which NATO wants to avoid.

&gt;It's obviously complicated. On one extreme you can have a foreign power setting up an insurgency in another country and then getting the insurgents to declare they are the legitimate government of part of the country or of the whole country. That seems to be what happened in Donestk and Luhansk People's Republics. Or maybe they are more comparable to Chechnya.

I think this is an important point when we are thinking about the ethics of independence. To what extent does the polity represent the will of the people it governs over, and to what extent is its leadership acting on its own volition?

It's clear that Kosovo, the Catalonians, the Iraqi Kurds, and so on were acting independently from foreign powers, whereas this isn't the case for D/LPR. While the degree to which they're *directly* controlled by Russia is unclear, the removal of independent-minded leaders for more pro-Russian ones (Plotnitsky for Pasechnik, Zakharchenko for Pushilin) from 2014-2017 indicates that this control has increased over time. 

While there were referendums on independence and there have been elections in their territories, the legitimacy of both of these have been contested (I don't know enough to have an opinion on this, maybe you do?), so I certainly think the ethics of the D/LPR independence is a lot more shaky than that of, say, Kosovo.",,,,1645728020,{},hy9wdhv,True,t3_szofnz,False,False,t1_hy9ijkg,/r/geopolitics/comments/szofnz/when_should_states_be_able_to_declare/hy9wdhv/,1653387602.0,5,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,,0,[],,1645699220.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So now Putin is looking at having a huge neighboring country ""in bed with the enemy"", so to say. And why strike now? Well, because the longer he gets, the worse it gets for him. 

1. Ukraine's army is better trained and better equipped by the year. 
2. Putin is getting older and Russia - weaker, manpower-wise.

As to why Ukraine become anti-Russia recently, well Russians will claim (as always) that is the work of ""fascists"" and ""the CIA"". Everyone who's not pro-Russia is a fascist or a CIA mole apparently. We need to check the CIA's budget. 

As an Eastern European myself, I can say that there are *zero* benefits to being Russia's ""partner"" or client state. It's mostly corruption, crime, and a lower standard of living and the threat of death if you disobey your Moscow overlords.

My point in saying all this is, is that in the communications era, the international community has more than enough power to make Russia, and her people, wary, soft-power style, but it's too disorganized given the poor leadership and lack of trust.

Pointless to talk about what ifs though. All I'm saying is the current leaders are particularly inept and shouldn't escape blame for allowing the situation to get to this state.

1. The chaotic withdrawal of the US support from Afghanistan and domestic politics have solidified the image of a weak America. The US can do nothing but watch and try to impose some sort of sanctions. Also, inflation is the #1 concern for American voters now and Biden knows that he can't risk a severe sanction causing commodity prices spiking even higher.

2. Europe is more dependent on Russian energy export than ever. You can't seriously confront your energy company in the winter. This will change in the future as green energy catch up and support for nuclear energy returns. If Putin does not invade now, it will be harder to pull off in the future.

3. The China-US relationship has cooled significantly and brings China and Russia closer. This invasion has China's tacit approval and likely China will step in if sanctions bite Russian economy hard. With Beijing's backing, Putin feels his hand is strong enough to take the risk.

4. Another possibility is that Putin didn't intend to invade from the start. He wanted to get even more concessions from NATO and Ukraine by posturing, but they called his bluff. Having sounded his war drums for so long and framing Ukraine as a national security issue, Putin has no way to back down without losing face.

If Russia gains control of Ukraine or manages to destabilize it on a major scale, a new era for the United States and for Europe will begin. U.S. and European leaders would face the dual challenge of rethinking European security and of not being drawn into a larger war with Russia. All sides would have to consider the potential of nuclear-armed adversaries in direct confrontation. These two responsibilities—robustly defending European peace and prudently avoiding military escalation with Russia—will not necessarily be compatible. The United States and its allies could find themselves deeply unprepared for the task of having to create a new European security order as a result of Russia’s military actions in Ukraine.

For Russia, victory in Ukraine could take various forms. As in Syria, victory does not have to result in a sustainable settlement. It could involve the installation of a compliant government in Kyiv or the partition of the country. Alternatively, the defeat of the Ukrainian military and the negotiation of a Ukrainian surrender could effectively transform Ukraine into a failed state. Russia could also employ devastating cyberattacks and disinformation tools, backed by the threat of force, to cripple the country and induce regime change.

Then there's the carrier escort fleet. Because deploying a carrier unescorted in Russian waters is insane. Another $20 billion or so...depending on what they deploy. If they want submarines and the other nice stuff they occasionally tack on, then we're looking at a few more billion on top. 

Then there's the 8,000 or so personel that crew all the ships in the CSG. And the 60-90 crack pilots. 

Now we times that by two. 

So the obvious choice is to put north of $100,000,000,000 of military hardware that's really quite irreplaceable considering the US's goals of maintaining the Monroe doctrine and keeping the Chinese polite, while maintaining order in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf...along with almost 20,000 of the US Navy's best and brightest...right smack in the middle of Russian home waters, well within strike range of just about every missile in the Russian arsenal, every plane they have, and every electronic warfare tool they possess.

The elephant in the room was the USSR's stockpile of nuclear weapons. The Ex-Soviet sphere was a nightmare in the 90s and the notion of every second petty dictator that might arise from that chaos having access to nuclear weapons was a headache for US policy makers who were busy planning out the 'American Century' that was to be the 2000s onwards.

For the US, it was better to maintain the status quo by ensuring that only one power inherited the Soviet Unions treaty obligations, UN security council status, and...their nuclear arsenal, because at the time, the power difference was so incredibly biased towards the US's favour that they knew they could do whatever they wanted and still avoid a nuclear confrontation with Russia (see the expansion of NATO into Eastern Europe). 

Now, in hindsight, it seems like a mistake, but the notion of nuclear proliferation to ex-Soviet states was certainly worrying to the US due to the unpredictability it would entail for their interests in Europe.

If they cross the Dniepr, then even the professionals would have a hard time with it, but until they hit Western Ukraine I expect operating in familiar territory, in regions that were historically 30-50% pro Russian would be more than achievable for the purposes of achieving a victory over the Ukrainian Armed Forces. 

From a geographical perspective, it doesn't make much sense for the Russian's to pursue an invasion of Western Ukraine because that territory is famously indefensible from the West, the population is much more anti-Russian and their supply lines and morale issues would begin to take a far more serious toll on their effectiveness.",,,,1645715753,{},hy8zrw1,False,t3_szgjri,False,False,t1_hy83qu9,/r/geopolitics/comments/szgjri/how_does_russia_administer_kaliningrad/hy8zrw1/,1653265779.0,3,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,,0,[],,1645686953.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Perhaps the bed had already been made.

Insofar as it remains determined to pursue the liberal order project, in whatever form, the West nevertheless did not show reasonable care with many of the developing and immature governments in the post-Soviet space. Yes, the West had and has a long term goal of spreading the liberal order and freedoms everywhere, including into Russia's traditional sphere of influence, and even into Russia itself. But Russia is a nuclear power, and this poses constraints on action and tends to expand the timeline for things. 

The West was never going to be able to support and defend nations like Ukraine and Georgia from Russian aggression in the foreseeable future without creating an unwarranted level of danger with respect to a nuclear conflict. This was just the reality. 

As such, I think the West let countries like Georgia and Ukraine start to think they were more free than they really were. In particular, Ukraine allowed extremely nationalist groups to create and spread a somewhat fake and immature form of anti-Russian nationalism that wasn't helpful for anyone. This nationalism gave the Ukraine government little room to maneuver. The West should have done a better job at grounding Ukrainians in the reality of the situation they were in, particularly around and after the Maidan. It's unclear that the West should have offered Ukraine the types of trade deals it did, or ever have even let the idea of Georgia or Ukraine being in NATO come up.

The long term game is and always has been convert Russia to liberal democracy with relatively compatible values to those of Europe, while allowing for some cultural differences. But this takes time. Russia has nukes. I think everyone could have been more patient here. In the end, I get that Georgia and Ukraine were sovereign agents and had the right to take the risks they did, but I feel the west did not show due care in egging them on, helping with color revolutions too near Moscow, etc. The West should have been the voice of sober reason, counseling patience and long term thinking on all those involved. This would not have meant giving in to Russian bullying, but rather simply accepting the reality of a nuclear world, and the time line this can impose. 

NATO expansion to the East was ultimately probably needed despite the risks of provoking Russia at the time. It helped keep US power and influence in Europe, which was needed at the time to make sure the core of Europe truly was pacified. The Baltics are a more complex question, but Ukraine and east of that was always a hard Russian red line. I feel that Western recklessness ended up helping Georgia and Ukraine essentially sacrifice themselves perhaps needlessly. In reality, they needed to continue playing a balanced and double game until such time as world pressure could force Russia to liberalize itself, and change its old school conception of geopolitics and Russia's special place in it. That was just the reality of nuclear weapons and the specific details of the post-Soviet space. 

Instead of having had to wait out the eventual conversion of Russia, or at least a major weakening of its power, as a semi-independent nation, now Ukraine may have to do so as an occupied territory. Still, I do believe it will be free again should it choose, but this will indeed likely take a while.

Long answer: On the one hand, as other have noted, Ukraine is culturally very close to European countries, so migrants will be more accepted naturally.

On the other hand, pretty much every one in Europe - except a very small pro-putin minority - is really pissed off about one of our democratic neighbours getting invaded by Russia. This is very different to Afghanistan or Somalia, which is ""far away"" for most people, for them this feels like home. It feels like Russia just started a war at their doorstep.

You can see the sentiment when looking at people in the media &amp; politics who were pro-Russia before and strongly against military technology aid for Ukraine, they all shifted to blame Russia and are suddenly open about delivering military aid. Even far-right groups are suddenly in line with progressives in blaming Russia, e.g. when looking at Mateo Salvini in Italy.

Rather, at the time and later, US primacy was seen as the only practical way to make the order work. If other key players in the order had too much capability, other allies might try to balance those capabilities, starting a classic geopolitical arms race. The world wasn't ready for Japan to rearm, even if an ally. There were worries that if Europeans rearmed, peace in Europe would not be maintained.

The hope over time is that after years of becoming accustomed to living under an order, maybe more things are possible without classic geopolitical balancing behavior reasserting itself. Perhaps the US can share more burdens now, and have a lesser degree of preemminence. The issue with France is whether they are really trying to make the actual order do its job better, or whether they are emotionally annoyed by US influence due to latent dreams of grandeur and a special kind of French nationalism. 

Anyways, the most critical question is whether the order can be maintained with greater multipolarity, and a reduced level of US preeminence.

Depending on what Putin’s advisors are telling him, territorial losses could be as bad as the pre Minsk Novorossiya Federation plan. It’s more likely to amount to the loss of Donetsk and Luhansk. 

The rest of Ukraine will likely be set up as a Russian-friendly puppet government. This government will sign a treaty or two confirming its losses, and then Putin will take steps to make sure that Ukraine stays away from Europe and NATO. Ukraine will then be left to its own devices.

The USA is the only member of NATO with the military might to rival Russia and its political interests aren't served by interfering too heavily in the war. The conflict is incredibly one-sided, so sending vast quantities of military aid to Ukraine would be like tying lots of very expensive balloons to a sinking ship. That said, the USA has given a lot of diplomatic, military (including intelligence), and economic aid (including ongoing Russian sanctions) to Ukraine throughout the last decade.

Turkey deserves a mention here for offering military aid in terms of equipment to Ukraine. Their interests are served in limiting Russian influence around the Black Sea.

The other European members are economically wealthy but militarily insignificant (hence their lack of diplomatic influence to stop this despite their efforts). Any military or economic support they can provide to Ukraine would simply be a token gesture.

There's also the fact that most of the European members of NATO value good relations with Russia highly - far more than they value the independence of Ukraine. Germany and France will crawl back to Russia in a few months time when it's politically acceptable to do so, due to their economic and cultural interests.

Tldr; the only significant member of NATO who actually cares is the USA and they have given all reasonable economic, diplomatic, and military aid.

This would be an interesting academic discussion, but for now I'd simply say Wilson was over a century ago and in the aftermath of the bloodiest war at that time, while Kosovo happened in 2008, following the end of the cold war. Different geopolitical eras.

Also we would need to consider the end of WW2, which was substantially different to the principles edicted by Wilson in 1919.

Personally, I hope they continue to try. I do have some doubts whether it is technically sustainable as multipolarity grows, but I would want to test that for the good of humanity.

The US has divided opinions, but if you look back at the oldest documents, the idea of US preeminence and unipolarity was not seen as an end in and of itself by many of the top policy makers. Rather, from a practical and even theoretical perspective, it was seen as the only way to make the order work. They may have been right. 

So the big question remains whether, now that much of the world has been trained in and become accustomed to the principles of the LIO, is a more multipolar order even possible? The US would like to share more of the burden, which inevitably means more capabilities for other major allies, and a greater share of the decision making. Can this technically work? Do too many players with more even amounts of leverage result in decision paralysis? Would the US not having overwhelming power result in other allies with growing capabilities starting to balance against one another and the US, rather than just cooperating? Can growing levels of emotional nationalism tolerate the US and major allies still having outsized influence over the sovereign decisions of individual nation states?

Zelensky reminds me of Pashinyan.

Such an inward focus also requires energy to not go to geopolitical matters, which could also be unpopular.

Putin has IMO fought attempts at reform every step of the way, and kept priority on geopolitics. It allows him to maintain influence in Belarus and Kazakhstan and even now forcibly return Ukraine to a Russian sphere of influence. It allows him to appear strong. However, it makes making such reforms more difficult and more necessary over time.

In this sense, I view Putin as quite similar to Brezhnev; Excessive spending on military, a military doctrine which justifies invasions of other nations in the name of defence, geopolitical influence primarily built on the excessive military, an era of little political reform and increasing repression, and yet still being seen as great stabilizers compared to their forerunners.",,,,1645696101,{},hy80bwf,False,t3_sznk8s,False,False,t1_hy6q8ef,/r/geopolitics/comments/sznk8s/many_people_call_vladimir_putin_a_great/hy80bwf/,1653129808.0,21,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,,0,[],,1645667301.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'd argue the West's recognition of Kosovo was the original sin - there is simply no way you can recognize one region seceding as being lawfully independent, while preventing other doing the exact same, at least on the international law aspect. The argument of protecting human rights is a dead end, as it's easy enough to pretend human rights are infringed, and even finding true infringements in any war zone. 

Note that there were widespread violations in Kosovo, I'm arguing here that it shouldn't have warranted recognizing Kosovo independence.

A few months afterwards, Russia did recognize Georgia's breakaway republics, citing human right violations. The same is happening now in Ukraine. Kosovo created a precedent for any major country to recognize seceding regions.

So I'd say there is no logic outside of geopolitical interests of the countries doing the recognition. The West and pretty much all countries except a few are never going to recognize Russian breakaway republics, nearly half the world will not recognize Kosovo (including Spain, which is very bad for Kosovo's long term prospects).",,,,1645695720,{},hy7zsl8,False,t3_szofnz,False,False,t3_szofnz,/r/geopolitics/comments/szofnz/when_should_states_be_able_to_declare/hy7zsl8/,1653127934.0,26,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,,0,[],,1645666920.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Putin came into power before I was born so maybe I was too young to witness the events that molded his reputation, but I'm having trouble finding actual evidence that he's done much of anything to position his nation well.

You look like a giant when you are surrounded only by dwarves.

That being said, some sparse thoughts follow as I still need to recover from the news.

The problem with Putin is the maintenance of himself in power and keeping the oligarchy who keeps him in power happy. This is done mainly at the expenses of the Russians with no diversification of the economy etc. He tries to look like a Tsar but this is not 1600 Russia having the strength of conquering whoever is at your borders.

With Russia in decline, lowest popularity in decades etc. I see today invasion as an act of an animal in a cage: it was the last chance of showing off that he can do and he can impose himself★. All of that helped by a West which was convinced that story ended and that Europe was now immune to wars and conflicts. Not only stupidly convinced of that but a West which had millions of deaths in two World Wars which are still in our memories and hurt. We were convinced that World War 2 ended all wars but it was obvious, without going too far and just stopping at the Balkans in the 90s, that it wasn't true, but we underestimated that and we just said that it was an ""ethnical war"" as if it actually made any difference.

So here we are, with history knocking at Europe's doors to come back in. Time ago, wars were a daily business in Europe and the quiet of the last 70something years has been the exception, not the norm. At least it is unlikely that France, Spain, Britain and Germany will start slapping each other in the face as it happened for the previous 1000 years.

About ★, it remains to be seen if this will play out internally because people in Russia could be pissed of by this as much as the people outside Russia.

Russia ""wins"" short term are a very likely possibility. Any collapse/toppling of Ukrainian government can/will be sold as a great victory and success for Putin with all the rhetoric Russia will sell with it. In the west most of the leaders will take countless hits of inaction or why didn't you do more, and so on. This will give the illlusion of a Russian victory. 

Russia will lose long term. Europe has no choice but to turn elsewhere for energy with the threat of Russia now realized. Sanctions will be in perpetuity on Russia as the Cold Wall is reforged by yet another generation of Russian aggression. Ukraine has the potential to bury Russia, half the level of resistance the U.S faced from Afghanistan would be enough to bleed Russia to death if an occupation is pursued, if not a choice of crippling  Ukraine turns into nothing except an open land with no benefit with the assured hatred of the populationsof 10's of millions of people( insurgents , bombing, sabotage, etc). 

The biggest beneficiary ( I hate to state such a thing in a war but this is geopolitics). The U.S will be the biggest beneficiary in this conflict. Europe can no longer pretend the Russia threat does not exist. There will be a military budget build up at a rate we've never seen in our generation. The call for U.S troops in European countries will be screamed for as dependance on the U.S will be an undeniable necessity. The U.S intelligence has been absolutely supreme in the lead up to the war, and that infrastructure of intelligence is unmatched. Europe and the U.S fissures have now been evaporated, and there will be no challenge to U.S leadership( in all things foreign affairs). 

Ukraine: I feel the worst for the people there. A few amount of us have been saying Russia will invade for a while now, when looking from a geopolitical perspective. That doesn't matter now though the time to leave has long past. The level of resistance after Russia ""claims"" victory is the thing to watch. Did Ukraine set up a guerilla warfare structure that can make Russia pay for invasion? Or will they cope with their new reality and live under their new conqueror without resistance.

During the Belarus crisis we already saw a robust response. This time the border between Russia and Ukraine will be a warzone, so while it may be possible for Ukrainian's to flee to europe others won't have the opportunity as with a full army immigration controls will be easy to implement. Similarly on the Belarus and Russian borders any migrant from the middle East will be treated not as an asylum seeker but as an enemy combatant. We won't be seeing a porus border anywhere.

Second, any country which allows it's people to be sent to Russia for this will be sanctioned to hell and beyond by the EU, For Example,  while Siberian overflight rights are important to Europeans most of the world cares more about getting their planes to the EU and guess who can bad airlines and countries which fly migrants to Russia?

Third, unlike Syria the situation is different, Ukraine is being invaded by a foreign power if anti Russian Ukrainian are forced to flee they can simply organise in the EU and fight back, so unlike in Syria anti Russian forces will have a safe haven where they can rest, be trained and armed, unless Russia decides to implement MAD

Fourth, while yes Ukrainian people are white Christian/atheists they are also more likely to end up in places like Poland, eastern and central European states where there already is a strong well established Ukrainian community.

We all know this. International law will only be paramount (of close enough) under some type of world order. But the Liberal International Order needs to first cover the world and then evolve before that can happen; and if the LIO falls, then the law has no chance of becoming supreme.

There are many reasons why International Law is not yet ready to be King of the World. But the most obvious is that there are two countries that are essentially outside the world order, who seek to undermine it, and that have permanent vetos on the Security Council.

The World Wars (and to a lesser extent the Cold War) can be seen as the final culmination of conflict between these empires, resulting in their disintegration (within 50 years of 1914 all of the European empires had lost their power).

To put it another way, in terms of GDP almost the entire economic activity of the world was involved in the world wars, while Russia today accounts for just 2% of the global economy.
