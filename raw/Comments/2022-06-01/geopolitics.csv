[],False,,exoriare,,,[],,,,text,t2_7n1sq,False,False,"It's been quite a while since I read Pettis. For instance, I have no idea about his thoughts on BRI.  I agree that China has long-ago picked all the low-hanging fruit, and they've engaged in a lot of unproductive investments. I'm probably more bearish on real estate than anything else though - land speculation has fueled a lot of local government funding. With that slowing down and the huge debts for high-speed rail, they're set to be squeezed from both ends. 

&gt; The main thing the Chinese need the US (by far the largest net importer) is 1) to dump excess production to keep domestic unemployment low 

Selling to the US isn't a goal in and of itself. The US is important only because the USD lets China buy the resources they need - oil and coal and soy. If you expand the footprint of the RMB and China can buy Russian O&amp;G for RMB (or Rubles), China's appetite for USD will decrease in a big way. China will be just as happy to sell electronics to Russia, or weapons to KSA. I think this is both a desirable outcome for China (the USD becomes effectively devalued, which increases China's status and cements its role as the primary center for global development), and it's a necessary one too (China has to shift to a high-wage economy and bear the pain that comes with it). 

&gt;  2) engage in technology transfer. Yes, we’re not giving them secrets, but we’re selling it to them. Take, for example, how the US designs the microchips that TSMC manufactures and sells to China.

Tech transfer is a process that has an expiry date. I think we've already passed that. China's domestic silicon is still 2 or 3 generations behind Western tech, but there is no path that will allow them to catch up the rest of the way. They can't reverse engineer the latest Western silicon. 

In most other sectors, China is near-peer already or has surpassed the West. They've already started soft-pedaling their [dominance in some key sectors](https://www.nextplatform.com/2021/11/15/why-did-china-keep-its-exascale-supercomputers-quiet/). There's simply not much more that China needs to learn from the West, and what remains, we refuse to teach them. You're right, tech transfer has been a critical bit of glue to bind China to the West, but that era is over - they can have a Tesla factory, but not a SpaceX one. 

&gt; You might disagree with me on that, and that’s fine. But what you can’t disagree on is that the Chinese are hardcapped in short and midterm future in terms of human capital. 

China has never cared about higher education to the same degree that the West does, and that I think is to their benefit. They graduate three times the number of engineers the US does, but degrees in liberal arts are a tiny fraction of what you'd expect in North America. They've begun doubling down on this approach - a year ago we saw huge protests as China merged vocational schools into elite colleges - they want to elevate the ""status"" of plumbers, electricians and other trades. 

Sorry, I don't have any papers on commodities and trade actions - my understanding of musical chairs is based on discussions I've had with economists. (I'm not well-educated by any stretch, but I do read a lot. I'm mostly interested in China in a geo-political context.)

The initial phase of this model is all about cheap exports. Huge sacrifices have to be made, but the goal is to land all the factories in the target sectors. During this phase, a low-value currency is essential. 

The next phase is when China will pivot toward their domestic economy. Instead of servicing 800M Europeans and North Americans, they'll focus on developing their internal markets. When Japan went through this pivot, the Yen tripled in value over the space of a few years. China will do the same. 

They still need resources to make this work. It's incredibly convenient for China that the West is forcing Russia into bed with the PRC - that will be an absolute windfall for them.

Compared to who? The US, tiny (500B). Japan? 160b. India? 70b. Russia sits at 55b. Maybe they're closer today, this year, but that's going to change when Russia runs out of money. I mean for god's sake, the Chinese do more business with Taiwan than they do with Russia (78b).  China is not friends with Russia (even if Russia wants to be friends with China). 

And pressures are heating up for Russia. The sanctions are getting stronger and stronger, and less and less trade is being tolerated. They haven't YET, but if the US and the EU wanted to really show some spine (or if they get scared enough by Russia's slowly advancing, very large army) and said ""China. Seriously. Stop trading with Russia. We need to apply some economic hurt here"", it's hard to see a reason for China to pick Russia over everyone else. 

&gt; Shipping routes pass by a lot of places. Neither Russia or China are at war with the US, and in the event of a war civilian shipping is unlikely to be targeted regardless of the route.

Why? We live in a world with a sanctioned Russia (a global superpower with nuclear bombs) and they can't get anything anymore. The fighting is limited to Russia and Ukraine, but if you think that means that it's business-as-usual and we're living in peace times, you're crazy. Russia can't get parts to service their aircrafts. When do you think those sanctions stop? Any time soon?If the Russians want any of those yummy goods they can't get anymore and see them floating on those ships, all within arms reach, what stops their military from just plucking ships out of that waterway? It's not like the Russians aren't known for brazen acts of pillaging (see Mariupol, the Belarusian black market of loot, and the Azov Steel Mill). How does a merchant vessel insure any cargo going through that water? Who insures it? If you find insurance, how horrific are those rates? If you're reckless and you do go ahead and try those waterways, the Russians are responsible to charting that straight to make sure the path anyone takes doesn't have anything that could damage ships. Do you trust the Russians not to cheap out on the effort? 

&gt; None of these are sticking points that change the fact that the distance from Europe to Asia is much shorter via the Arctic, and many of them aren’t issues at all.

The reality is that France, Germany, Italy (Italy has tripled its oil imports from Russia so their oil companies are laughing their way to the bank as they resell it to all the European countries that sanctioned themselves) are not keen on the ""defeat"" of Russia, however nebulous that is. Italy released a peace plan that matches French attitudes. Essentially ceasefire, referendums in Donbass and Crimea with major autonomy, etc. This is majorly different from the defeat the Russians at all cost attitudes shown by the US, UK and EE. And it's summer right now - when winter and elections hit good luck. Grain and wheat issues in MENA also a big factor.

Hard truth is as this drags on people will be less willing to maim themselves for it. 

Germany has done literally nothing major. Defense spending is not the reason the German military is weak. There are deep systemic problems that need to fixed. Some emotional responses in the legislature doesn't solve those issues - time and execution will. Words are not actions or results (same problem plagues American domestic politics). Sending rusty tanks is pretty weak. Sanctions are definitely big but impact to Europe is at least as big as Russia if not more. This is not counting all ways to bypass it (Iran is sanctioned and making more money then ever before) 


Wars and conflict are not determined by knee jerk responses but actions in the years preceeding it. Russia picked times of high oil/gas prices and increased ties with Asia (as an alternative to Europe). Russia is well positioned in the middle east. They can significantly up the ante with support to Iran, Hezbollah, Syria, Hamas, Houthis which they have refrained from. This keeps the Peninsular Arab states, Turkey, and Israel in check, especially with respect to oil price war. Rosfnet has some of lowered clearing prices in the world so they can handle a price war too. Add in Biden and MBS feud and more issues. Isrealis want to contain Iran but Europe needs Iran and America needs Europe but Russia can light flames too. China will not let Russia fail because more American defense money in Europe is less defense money in Asia. If American money leaves Europe it comes down to the Germans and French and their positions are not clear. 

Europe and America did zilch in the years preceeding this except antagonizing China and Iran. No strategic preparation, no LNG terminals, no re orientation towards non Russian hydrocarbons. The US alone has used a third of its javelins and will need 3 years to replace them. And the US has significantly more stockpiles than any European nation.

This is the reality, Russia has prepared for this and has more options and preparation.

""At this stage of the war in Ukraine, as Russia steps up its offensive in the Donbas and more revelations of the atrocities committed by its forces emerge, the prospect of any kind of negotiated peace between Moscow and Kyiv seems remote. Even earlier this spring, when delegations from the two sides were meeting, the talks had little impact on either Russia’s or Ukraine’s determination to keep fighting. And at times, both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin have been dismissive of the negotiations. Today, the sides have effectively suspended their diplomatic efforts.  
Amid the gloom, it would be easy to forget the real progress that negotiators have already made. In late March, Ukrainian diplomats introduced an innovative framework for a deal that could provide a pathway out of the war. And crucially, the proposal, which was leaked to the press following talks in Istanbul on March 29, has already received at least preliminary support from both sides. At the center of the proposed deal is a trade: Kyiv would renounce its ambitions to join NATO and embrace permanent neutrality in return for receiving security guarantees from both its Western partners and from Russia.  
Perhaps because of its novelty, the significance of the Istanbul proposal has yet to be appreciated in many Western capitals, where security guarantees have become synonymous with treaties of alliance. Unlike an alliance, which unites close partners in common defense, usually against a potential enemy, the proposed deal calls for geopolitical rivals to guarantee Ukraine’s long-term security jointly, outside of an alliance structure—and to do so despite one of the rivals’ ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine. If the proposal were to become the basis of an eventual settlement, the result would be a mechanism, however counterintuitive, that would make Russia itself a stakeholder in Ukraine’s security.""

Global geopolitics visited the Indo-Pacific region once again thanks to the Qeepened efforts to enhance cooperation. A wide range of issues was reflected in the Joint Statement following the meeting of Quad leaders in Tokyo on 24 May 2022. China had in 2018 commented that the Quad would dissipate like sea foam.Though China and Russia do not figure in the Statement, their presence is writ large as the forces that need to be confronted. China, in particular, as the global geopolitical competition is about Beijing’s advancing rise in power.

On the day the Quad met, China and Russia carried out airborne military exercises in contiguous areas of Japan and South Korea. The message to the Quad was unmistakable. Strategically, China’s concern is about its competitors closing ranks across several fields of the international system. The field that this article relates to information sharing and its utility.

The information-sharing field has been named the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness (IPMDA). It is designed to respond to humanitarian and natural disasters and combat illegal fishing. The idea is to integrate regional information fusion centres in the Indian Ocean, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. In the strategic competition, sharing of information is key. Strategically, it has heft as the integrated capacity created can also be used for military purposes. Though some mechanisms for sharing information already exist, it is a renewed thrust.

Cooperation in disaster and humanitarian relief often involves military assets of different countries that must be able to operate together. The communication integration achieved is fungible and can be utilised for political and military purposes

The provision to curb illegal fishing on the agenda of the Quad is likely to remain unimplementable. But platforms established for the flow of information regarding illegal fishing could certainly serve strategic functions. When combined with cooperative initiatives in infrastructure, cyber security, critical and emerging technologies and space, the scale of cooperation envisaged is striking. The political push by the leadership of the Quad countries seems promising. India has placed a strategic bet on the grouping after initial reluctance.

You realise how much quicker going north around Russia will be for Europe-Asian shipping right?

The Northern shipping route reduces the distance from Western Europe to East Asia by about 1/3 and skips paying the Suez Canal fees. The waters are also pirate free.

Even considering costs for stopping at Russian ports along the way it's estimated that the NAR will reduce the cost of shipping between Europe and China by 15% and allow 2-3 extra ships sent per year if its open for 6-9 months.

NOW I must admit its difficult to predict how this will effect geopolitics. It's unlikely to effect the decision making process of Europe as much the current oil/gas dependence does.

Bur to conclude it ONLY benifits Russia and has no geopolitical impact on the rest of the world is short sighted at best. A lot of shipping will choose to go this way when travelling to Asia (and perhaps the Northern ports of the American west coast depending on ship size and Panama costs) and shipping has always shipped geopolitics.",4a9550b77c0b92e95e1f9e92c11ecc69d0082c6a,True,False,,,,,0,1654061362,,0,{},iar5ujc,False,t3_v221y4,False,True,t1_iaqztg5,/r/geopolitics/comments/v221y4/list_of_lesser_known_geopolitical_events_that/iar5ujc/,1654061374,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1654032562.0

Probably not that big of a deal. It would be useful for Russia to make a port and sail down the Pacific to make trade with China, but to do that, the ships have to sail out of Murmansk, all the way around the country, and then down waterways that border Alaska. No shot. No Russian or Chinese merchant's vessel takes the risk of getting tangled up with the US Navy in Alaska.

But let's say the ship captain is nuts and thinks he's Han Solo and risks being seen... Then he's still got to get past Hawaii. Then Japan. Then finally hit the ports in China, in full view of everyone. If what the Russians want to ship is oil to Shanghai, then gotta actually go further down the coast in full sight and range of Australia and their nuclear submarine and their brand new cruise missiles the US just sold them.

And there is no way any of this happens because China dares not trade with Russia that openly. Doing so invites the risk of the US sanctioning China right along with Russia. Now, if China had a way of accepting these goods and not be seen accepting these goods, they would do so. I do not put the Chinese government above smuggling when it profits them. But they can't do it. We're watching them for it and it's really easy to catch it happening. If the US wants to stop it, there's nothing the Russian Navy could do to stop it. NO WAY the Chinese Navy tries to throw its weight around because again, Russia-style sanctions would kill the Chinese economy flat out.

Besides all that, those waterways don't matter much anyway except to the Russian government. They have only military applications, but only defensive purposes. And it's a huge additional expense if the Russians do decide to use it and maintain it. If they want to navigate those waters, they gotta set up navigational equipment and the ice and the cold would just cause too much damage to that equipment. And there's nobody and nothing around up there, so there's no way to support anything or anyone to maintain anything they do put up there.

And say you are, hypothetically, Russian navy and you're traveling those waters and you have a breakdown or some sort of trouble with your boats or crew up there... who's coming to save you? How do you rescue the ship when there's nobody and nothing up there to call out to or come get to you. If the ship sinks, how do you tow it out to clear the lane?

Nobody else can use that waterway besides the Russians because that pathway is way too vulnerable to let US Navy and their supercarriers and their nuclear submarines be let up in there. No US or US-allied ship would use those waterways without protection from the Navy. No insurance company would ever take the risk and would never insure that ship defenseless. No way you trust the Russian navy to keep that cargo safe or those lanes clear and safe and with enough infrastructure to guarantee the crew.",dcecdd93d8b02d0b3fd1cad44786976ab209544d,True,False,,,,,0,1654057338,,0,{},iaqztg5,False,t3_v221y4,False,True,t1_iaqt9ek,/r/geopolitics/comments/v221y4/list_of_lesser_known_geopolitical_events_that/iaqztg5/,1654057355,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1654028538.0
