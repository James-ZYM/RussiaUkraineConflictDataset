*The Court shall have jurisdiction in respect of war crimes in particular when committed as part of a plan or policy or as part of a large-scale commission of such crimes.*  
*For the purpose of this Statute, ‘war crimes’ means:*  
*a.) Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, namely, any of the following acts against persons or property protected under the provisions of the relevant Geneva Convention:*  
*i.* ***Wilful killing;***  
*ii. Torture or inhuman treatment, including biological experiments;*  
*iii.* ***Wilfully causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or health;***  
*iv.* ***Extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly;***  
*v. Compelling a prisoner of war or other protected person to serve in the forces of a hostile Power;*  
*vi. Wilfully depriving a prisoner of war or other protected person of the rights of fair and regular trial;*  
*vii. Unlawful deportation or transfer or unlawful confinement;*  
*viii. Taking of hostages.*  


*Other serious violations of the laws and customs applicable in international armed conflict, within the established framework of international law, namely, any of the following acts:*

*i.* ***Intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population as such or against individual civilians not taking direct part in hostilities;***  
*ii.* ***Intentionally directing attacks against civilian objects, that is, objects which are not military objectives;***  
*iii. Intentionally directing attacks against personnel, installations, material, units or vehicles involved in a humanitarian assistance or peacekeeping mission in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, as long as they are entitled to the protection given to civilians or civilian objects under the international law of armed conflict;*  
*iv.* ***Intentionally launching an attack in the knowledge that such attack will cause incidental loss of life or injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects or widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment which would be clearly excessive in relation to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated;***  
*v.* ***Attacking or bombarding, by whatever means, towns, villages, dwellings or buildings which are undefended and which are not military objectives;***

The list is long, but this qualifies as a war crime under a number of different identified designations by the UN.

Also the United States has version 6 of the AH-64E it it has CDAS (cognitive division aiding system). It also can merge different radio frequency's.

&gt;First, yes, policies matter. Deeply. Not only do they apply to the analysts, but also to the board of the institution and independent directors, who are not compensated to any measurable factor by the institution. I understand that governance policies are not something you may understand fully, but could be a fun bit of homework for you.

Thank you for the enlightening insight that ISW's policies 'apply' to ISW. This is really a revolutionary observation that I, a law student, will carry with me for the rest of my life. Thanks for sharing your wisdom

&gt;I refuse to believe you struggle with reading comprehension, but I mentioned the people (the board, fellows and the analysts of the ISW) are generally academics. In fact, this is true for most think-tanks. Keep up, cupcake!

This is probably one of the dumbest args I've seen, and I'm pretty sure you know that. It's just so dumb that you would have to know it's wrong as you're typing it. But alas, for the few unfortunate readers following along, I'll respond.

Here's the form of your argument:

1. Majority of ISW staff is comprised of former and present academics 
2. Nobody enters academia because they want to be rich 
3. **Therefore**: The ISW staff is unbiased

I responded that, well, ISW isn't a part of academia. So just going off of your argument, we have no clue why ISW staff chose to work for them. The only real way to salvage the argument is to say that people that enter academia will never be employed in biased organizations. Which is just patently false. 

My point is clear for anybody who is attempting to understand it and not just try to say meaningless things to stir up confusion

&gt;You really don’t know how 501c3s work, huh? Lol. How furiously were you googling ;)? So, as a non-profitable charity, they are significantly more likely to be audited. This is the Russian analyst writing most of the stuff that we critique here:  
[https://www.understandingwar.org/press-media/staff-bios/mason-clark-0](https://www.understandingwar.org/press-media/staff-bios/mason-clark-0)

Ok wow, slow down with the knowledge dropping. It's going too quick for my poor, tired brain. Yes how silly of me, you're right, I had forgotten about the foundationally important observation that 501c3 are......significantly more likely to be audited...

Thank goodness they have a higher chance of being audited, because that really addresses the systemic issue of the war sector enough power and resources to influence American government and geopolitics. Especially so when the auditing body is completely neutral and isn't also subject to the same financial interests.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Yes, the \~24 year old, 3 years out of undergrad is the propaganda mastermind controlling the strings! Or, do you think the puppet master is still hidden behind the curtains? The conspiracies intensify.

I'm so confused, you seem to think I'm advocating for some conspiracy - that there's some puppet master somewhere, perhaps a secret staffer or board member, that is pulling the strings of the entire government or at least the DoD! Right here from the unassuming Institute for the Study of War! 

Where are you getting this from? I haven't even come close to suggesting that, because, as you correctly note, it's patently a stupid belief. But perhaps you have an interest in trying to attribute these dumb takes to me...

I'm not hiding the ball from anybody here:  **Companies that manufacture weapons make more money if more people buy their weapons. People buy more weapons if there are more wars. Therefore these companies have a financial interest in sustainable amounts of conflict.**

There's no ""hidden puppetmaster,"" it's just economics

&gt;And Raytheon, who had $64 billion in turnover last year, is OH so invested in the ISW who has literally thousands of donors, but has less than $4 million in revenue and pays all of its staff (over 25 people) $2.9 million a year? Jesus, Sherlock, you’ve cracked the case!! I should be fair to you, that‘s a king’s ransom in Russia and China!

Why do you keep saying nonsense things with the aesthetic of being important? Are you trying to trick people?

ISW has more donors than just Raytheon, so ISW isn't biased?

Their total revenue is $4 million, so...ISW isn't biased? Can you tease out the argument here? I'm really missing it. $4 million may be a tiny fraction of Raytheon's total budget, but it's 100% of ISW's revenue. $4 million means a lot more for ISW (or any other donee) than Raytheon. Without the conglomerate $4 million, ISW wouldn't exist. ***The very existence of ISW depends on being financed by its donors*****.** 

Also, I count 15 employees that would be paid by ISW. Would be curious as to where you got your employee count.

&gt;I think you are struggling with reading comprehension. First, your premise is false because that isn’t what the OP posited. You’re putting your words in his mouth. Second, it still doesn’t address the main point. The analogy is wrong because it doesn’t deal with the inherent biases of changing sources. I know you’re deeply indoctrinated, hence the lack of objectivity, but that’s why the homework I’m assigning would help.

Wow I didn't know arguing was so easy. First, my premise is right because you are poopy doopy. Second, it adequately accounts for you being a doo-doo poopy-farty head. The analogy is right because of epistemological limitations of the body-mind  and \[insert other buzzwords\].

Normally you don't just make claims - you try to give reasons why the claims are true. Not enough just to say I'm wrong.

Also, ***you*** are the OP, in the sense that I'm responding to a claim ***you*** **made.** 

&gt;It’s funny how you guys quote the ISW very, very selectively when it suits your narrative, but otherwise, insist it’s pro-Ukranian every time their analysis is actually objective....  
&gt;  
&gt;...SO, there IS a bias, just not the one you’d like to believe.

I'm saying that, in fact, it ***is not*** funny to quote ISW in this way. And I'm doing this by just switching out ISW with a pro-russia think tank, instead of a pro-america/ukraine one.",0500e69356837ad9035b6871df5945c036d72d40,True,False,,,,,0,1654126718,,0,{},iaul6ue,False,t3_v1es7w,False,True,t1_iaqcnvx,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v1es7w/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_53122/iaul6ue/,1654126734,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654097918.0,

&gt;During the conscription service, I have been to shooting practices four times, where each time I fired 6 rounds. Since school, when in the 10th grade we went to military training camps for two weeks, I was amazed, perplexed and surprised - why is it so?! Why are we only allowed to fire 6 rounds? Indeed, in order to ‘feel’ the assault rifle you need at least 15 rounds in a magazine, so the person could shoot 2-4 single rounds and then try bursts of 4-5 rounds. Yet to do it properly, of course everyone needs a whole magazine - 30 rounds! My opinion is that the target shooting with 6 rounds which is en-masse used in Russians army and MIA - is just a mockery of military training!!!

 

&gt;In the order by the commander of the Western military district regarding sending me into a unit it was indicated that I was meant to be sent to accelerated survival training courses. They were meant to last two weeks. Also, my contract selection instructor at the regional selection point was saying they would ‘teach me up a little bit, teach how to fire from everything - from a grenade launcher, machine gun, sniper rifle’. In reality - this all turned out to be a lie. None of us (22 people) were taught anything. We were not even allowed to try our weapons.",ff38b32f2313801c9d533587a5fc75b110dc2955,True,False,,,,,0,1654123907,,0,{},iaufazh,False,t3_v2m75m,False,True,t1_iau1mc5,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v2m75m/attack_on_the_28th_brigade_of_the_armed_forces_of/iaufazh/,1654123926,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654095107.0,

Below is a pro-PKK source saying that senior YPG leading positions are directly controlled by PKK. For example, their military leader Mazloum Abdi is an old PKK leader. Other PKK sources also confirm that a lot of YPG fighters are PKK. On top of this, you can add they have the same ideologi, same organization KCK, same finance, same weapons supplier, same goal, same operatus modi, same training locations. YPG simply can't be more PKK than this. 

In principle every source which are dealing with real facts say that the YPG is PKK. This include CIA and american military but american and european politicians simply prefer to look in an other direction when it comes to PKK. You can also add greeks, armenians, arabs, iranians, zionist, russians and obviously PKK itself to the list of people trying to twist reality of PKK.

They mostly provided their intel for Turkish army. How good that intel will be though? We can't decide that from here. From what I've gathered, Peshmerga have different views on PKK. Some says that they're a dishonor to Kurdish legacy in the region and jeopardize their autonomy and independence, therefore must be fought (well, them being terrorists has impact as they've killed more Kurds than they've killed Turks). Some think that they're not good but a Kurd must not fight another Kurd. Kurds are very fractional and tribalistic. Therefore this idea only lives in their thoughts as tribals fight against each other regularly.

SDF is an offshoot of YPG. YPG was reestablished by US into a political party with the help of other Northern Syrian parties such as majority Arabs, minority Turkmen and whatnot. Not to mention, these parties have little to no voice in SDF coalition. YPG has substantial connection to PKK as they regularly exchange soldiers, weapons, materials and logistics. An US general admitted these connections, but they thought they could make something of a Syrian KRG by renaming them along with something ""democratic in the middle."" Only that shattered when SDF failed to separate themselves from PKK. Then US withdrawal happened and Turkish forces took former US positions.

The munition will release or explode containing the White Phosphorus, which ignites when exposed to oxygen.
Since it is a chemical reaction, it is difficult to extinguish.
Each speck is a piece of White Phosphorus which is burning. If they fall on you or a structure they continue to burn until the chemical reaction is completed. Usually that means they keep burning for a while.
White Phosphorus is also known as 'Willy Pete' (WP) and can come in grenade form as well as artillery or guided bomb.

Some militaries will lie and say they are used as a 'smoke screen' but obviously they cause more damage than just smoke if used in certain ways.

Long-term, no idea to be honest. I've grown up watching US movies, a lot of which focus highlighting freedom as the core value of the US. And when you grow up, you see a lot of issues with it, that it's not what it seems - so there's definitely issues there (and I know a bunch of issues the US has in general).

But on the other hand, I know more than a few people in Russia and from a civilization perspective Russia is a deeply messed up system. Close to being a dictatorship (although formally not one), a bunch of corruption and lack of civil rights. A lot of things are being done through brute force, and the country is stagnating (I feel actually sad for it as I've always admired the Russian people and think there's a lot of potential, if you look at any category, literature, science, etc. you'll see a lot of Russians). But think the government is more focused on creating a power system that they will benefit from, rather than the country/people will benefit from.

China is an interesting one as well - they pulled of state owned capitalism in a quality way. And their economy is constantly on the rise. On the other hand, they have a dictatorship plus a lot of shit (such as education camps and similar), so it's not really good.

If I would pick the lesser evil, from my knowledge now I'd pick the West (btw, I spoke about the US as people usually correlate it to the West, but I just took them as an extreme). Is it the better choice looking far in the future, I can't say, but it's my opinion looking from a civilization perspective and a bit of a moral perspective (treat them as just words as I'm using my knowledge, which can be limited)

&gt; I don't want the EU or WHO or some other supranational organization making decisions in my country

Why do you think a supervisory organisation is inherently bad. Even extreme organizations, like the mafia decided it's a better route to go - countries are not alone on this planet and sometimes it's better for us to have a higher perspective. Yes, that higher perspective can be ruled by bias as well as specific narratives (or just subjected to corruption and similar), but it doesn't make the idea inherently bad.

&gt; But I also am not foolish enough to think that It was out of the blue

On that note, I think there's a huge difference in the narrative ""the West wanted it and made it happen"" vs. ""the West knew it was going to happen and didn't do anything to stop it"", and let's say one of these is true - I don't know why people jump on the first one. War generally benefits a select few, not necessarily the whole country, and there's always some that benefit from war. But war is also highly volatile, even if it's a proxy war. A lot of things can go wrong, that's why countries generally resort to political or economic warfare.

Now, did the West initiate it or knew there was a high chance that it will happen and didn't focus on diplomatic efforts, I have no idea - I don't see the whole situation that much to have a good assessment of it. It's easy to say they wish a weakened Russia, but hard to say what this means economically and how much they're willing to sacrifice for it. So I honestly don't have a clue.

I just don't like jumping to that narrative because of things like ""US is always pulling the strings on everything"", it avoids some simple facts as well - that Russia was trying to pull strings in Europe, for example. Maybe the two are related, maybe not, honestly don't have a clue. (something that I do find interesting is UK, the conservative party was heavily influenced by Russia a few years ago, and now they're fully against Putin/Russia - don't know if it has any meaning, but it's interesting)",42bf56256a47454fc40f3bfe1674aa9225740c02,True,False,,,,,0,1654117018,,0,{},iatztvl,False,t3_v1es7w,False,True,t1_iasg7gq,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v1es7w/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_53122/iatztvl/,1654117030,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654088218.0,

But yes, you're right... albeit for the wrong reason. 

Once the device is captured and reverse engineering is done, that communication channel will be known and equipment designed to interface with it. So the communication medium itself isn't really why these things are unlikely to be hacked (when developed by a military contractor). 

There's an interesting practice involved with high-grade military drones, supposedly: Mathematical proofs. For a while I wondered why there weren't news stories of military drones being taken over. I can't seem to find it now, but when researching mathematically proven micro-kernels, I found a publicly published paper on this sort of thing being done with military drones.

Russia could strike staging areas in Poland if they get to the point of desperation. The other alternative is to double down and level cities in Ukraine. Bottom line is the more they get pushed into a corner, the more desperate they will behave. Unless we have a way to magically make those nukes disappear, this is a dangerous game of push and pull. That's why US is extremely selective on what weapons to send and slowly waits for a Russian response which so far as been to do nothing about it. Then US keeps pushing a little more and a little more each time. 

How far until Russia decides enough is enough and starts doing something about it? Leveling some staging areas in Poland will send the message.

The current situation is that Russia has made NATO deployment in Ukraine their red line, but that's by decree not agreement. NATO is under no obligation to not deploy troops to Ukraine as they've been invited by the government. The only thing preventing them is potential for conventional/nuclear escalation. If an invading Russian soldier whilst in Ukraine gets killed by NATO forces that should be considered a legitimate target, and if Russia didn't have nukes it's what would be happening.

It is in NATO's interest to continually erode the position Russia has stated, as it otherwise de facto means nuclear armed states can act with impunity while they set arbitrary red lines and ignore international convention. This is why they have slowly increased the firepower (heaviness) of the weapons they are willing to send. If Russia won't nuke for NLAWs, why not stingers, why not IFVs, why not MLRS, why not F16s... The reality is nobody wants nuclear war and both sides know it. They just don't want to panic people because that's when things can escalate out of control.

It's easy to do radio silent recon then fly home to review footage, or tell the drone to circle/hover until it finds the designated target then engage without ever turning on the radio.

Maybe I'm misreading your post, but automatic killing drones already exist. Not just in secret or just in the US. Robustly having a computer identify friend or foe is hard, but if you don't mind some false positives (and many militaries don't), identifying a person/vehicle/building and guiding a payload to it was solved decades ago.

I think both Ukraine and the US and other allies are well aware that Russia still has tremendous room to mobilize if it becomes motivated enough, hence the desire for Ukraine not to fire HIMARS missiles into Russia.

I also think western countries are very fearful of a mobilization because realistically if Russia mobilizes say two million of its 20million males in the 20-40 age range - Ukraine is gone.

If you're Russian and you bunch up some Ukrainian hobby drone will wipe your squad out with a dropped morter round. If you're Ukrainian and you bunch up at night time some Russian night optic is sighted on you and this happens.

There are many valid critical statements to be made about Russian ability to utilize combined arms, although it seems fighting an actual brutal war like this is going to force them to rip the bandaid off and adapt fast. Honestly when this war ends Russian military (unless they face total defeat) will likely be at their highest levels of competence they've been since the cold war.

The usage of drones in this war is definitely going to cause militaries around the world to adapt or accelerate their anti-drone capacity. Wouldn't surprise me if in future conflicts a member of each squad will have some equipment to detect and destroy hostile drones.",d75866b0f5f027444b7fc20f071ebafb254702be,True,False,,,,,0,1654107741,,0,{},iatddyc,False,t3_v1es7w,False,True,t3_v1es7w,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v1es7w/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_53122/iatddyc/,1654107760,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654078941.0,

One saving grace for us though was that mortars take a lot of skill to employ effectively.

Whether Ukrainian nationalists want to take those cities by force or not, it doesn't mean they will nor does it represent the opinion of the whole nation. Nor will the government convert those wishes into action.

Ukraine has had Crimea taken from them by force. Did they do anything about it? And it's their land. But you jump to the conclusion that they will easily invade Russia? Because some nationalists have been speaking about it??

Ukraine would have never invaded Russia. I don't know in which fantasy world you live in, but nukes are an end to any war. If someone decides to invade a nuclear power (especially on the scale of Russia), it's a direct escalation that can result in nukes. Even if Ukraine would mass a bunch of missiles near the border, the moment they invade, it's the end of Ukraine - if the West would support it, and decided to fire back at them, it could be a fucking hell on Earth.

Political warfare and economical warfare is a different thing completely, and that is another story. But military-wise, forget about it.

But let's go to another point, Russia on the other hand has meddled in Ukraine's politics for a while now - why? They did support the separatists, annexed Crimea and invaded it recently. Why? Did anyone force them to do this?

You can say, but Russia simply wishes to be on level terms with the US, who has been expanding their influence through relations with the EU and through NATO. But then you look at what Putin has built out of Russia - a dictatorship where he and people close to him have absolute power. It doesn't add up... (unless you read too much Dune and think that dictatorship is actually better for the people...)

&gt; And about his argument: In some future hypothetical conflict Ukranians and Baltic state would be the first to step on russian land with joy and hatred and fire rockets from their territory.

Again, nukes. And whatever you think about people, not everyone wants war. Peace and stability is generally more valuable to an average person. Plus you're avoiding another big point here - Russia would love to have ownership of these countries, completely. So who's the actual culprit here?

However, Putin has done a good job of getting his country back in some sort of order since then and now Cold War 2 is here.

Russia lost considerable “territory” during the 90’s and fair enough they don’t feel very secure, but to go and actually invade Ukraine I think was a bad move on their part and the US may have calculated it was a move they were willing to let them make. 

If the invasion had gone really well for Russia then the US and UK (I’m not sure France and Germany like it) would have miscalculated, however it hasn’t, and Russia are currently bogged down and looking weak. A win for the West. But then Russia will probably end up with a lot more natural resources so they win too. Just no one in Europe will fear them now like they did before so I’m not sure where they go from here.

: a sudden decisive exercise of force in politics  
especially : the violent overthrow or alteration of an existing government by a small group  
[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coup%20](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coup%20)  


The second part is the *conventional* understanding, which cannot be applied to Ukraine. Yanukovych was not overthrown, he simply fled. There was no military general staff/cabinet minister that removed him by force.

By your definition, you can widely apply ""coup"" to literally any forceful protest that seeks political change in government. Was the US Jan 6th Capital Attack now a coup because I don't think it was?

&gt;Most crucially, if we give Maidan the dignity of ""revolt"" or ""rebellion"" then the Eastern seperatists get them too.

The war in the Donbass with the separatists was definitely a revolt, no argument there. However, their aims were to secede from their country and join another. So big difference, but both are not coups by conventional definition.

&gt;Their votes negated and overruled undemocratically, and were further protesting against the clearly discriminatory and anti-ethnic russian hostility of the coup regime which removed their languages official status as soon as it took power

Been drinking a little too much Russian disinformation kool aid, have you? Fuck off with the cultural genocide argument. Explain centuries of Russification. What happened to the Crimean Tatars?  

&gt; Because the contending sides favouring different flags is actually the norm.

Little different when one side is wanting to join a different country. You didn't see the Confederates plead to join Britain or Mexico in 1861..

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In short, about the situation on the frontline.  
  
   
  
Kharkiv – the frontline has stabilised at a slight distance from and along the RF border. Positional fights.  
  
   
  
South of Izyum – no changes.  
  
   
  
Krasnyi Lyman – the operation has mostly concluded, remnants of the defeated enemy units are leaving the eastern bank of Siverskyi Donetsk, our forces are clearing the adjacent forests. Could also note that it was not possible to cross the river “on the enemy’s shoulders”, and most likely the frontline will stabilise along this line the same way as upstream and downstream.  
  
   
  
Severodonetsk. The enemy, snarling, is gradually leaving the city due to limited ability to support the garrison via destroyed bridges, which are under continuous artillery and aviation strikes of RF AF. I presume the clearing of the industrial zone of the city will last another day or two, unlikely more (unless UAF will not throw in another large unit to be slaughtered).  
  
   
  
Lysychansk-Zolotoye area. Fierce fights with a very slow advance on RF AF and DPR AF (in addition to PMCs). The enemy continues fierce resistance in the “bag” hoping for it to be unblocked. Most likely, by deploying reserves the UAF managed to clear the Bakhmut-Lysychansk highway pushing out our forces, however the highway is under continuous shelling and supplying the enemy group through it is difficult. It can be stated with a high degree of certainty that the outcome and timing of the conclusion of liberation of Lysychansk depend specifically on whether the Russian forces will be able to cut off these supply lines. In any case, this is extremely important since the advancing forces themselves are in a “pocket” with not that wide of a neck, so until Zolotoye is taken – the danger for rears and flanks will remain.  
  
   
  
On the Bakhmut-Soledar line – no significant changes, local hostilities continue, the new frontline is forming.  
  
   
  
In Avdeevka area – no significant changes: fights to improve the positions \*of Russian forces\*, fierce artillery skirmishes.  
  
   
  
Maryinka area and to the South towards Uhledar – no significant changes, positional fights.  
  
   
  
Zaporizhye frontline – no changes.  
  
   
  
Kherson frontline – I believe that attacks of UAF in Davydov Brod area were quite large-scale, but still only “reconnaissance by force”. UAF suffered substantial losses, however the amount of manpower and equipment brought into the battle does not allow us to speak about a disruption of the offensive. During the attacks, the enemy has had certain advance but did not achieve breakthrough of the frontline.  
  
   
  
Donetsk, Makeevka, Horlivka – yesterday were again under heavy artillery shelling. I do not rule out that in the coming days the shelling can become truly massive.  
  
   
  
General conclusion: the advance of the Russian troops in Donbas is fading, and without deployment of fresh reserves will not lead to the defeat of the enemy. At the moment, the most important question for the Russian command is the capture of Lysychansk, which will consolidate the successes in Popasna by liquidating the dangerous bulge of the UAF strongpoint in Lysychansk-Zolotoye area. Most likely, in the coming week the main efforts of our forces will be directed at completing this task, and I’m not expecting any major operation until this is done.  
  
   
  
RF AF and DPR AF are in dire need of combined-arms reserves to develop the achieved successes. In this regard, the hostilities taking place in the fortified in advance and saturated with enemy forces positions are characterised as “gnawing” through the defences, inevitably leading to heavy losses for both sides without major successes for the attacker.  
  
   
  
As of 1 June the UAF group in Donbas is NOT defeated although it took significant losses and was forced to abandoned a number of important localities (in a month: Popasna, Svetlodarsk, Krasnyi Lyman, Severodonetsk) and in places retreat to the second line of defence.  
  
   
  
Predictions of the next 7-10 days:  
  
   
  
Russian forces will be forced to continue attacking Lysychansk, trying to defeat or at least push out the defending group of UAF and capture the city. New attempts to cross Siverskyi Donets are possible (I hope that if they happen, they will not be failures like all before them). UAF will continue defending in this area.  
  
   
  
At other parts of the Donetsk frontline the offensive battles will presumably be of a tactical nature, except for perhaps Avdeevka where a promising offensive (to the north) was stopped in favour of transferring forces to Severodonetsk-Lysychansk direction.  
  
   
  
UAF actions: The enemy is likely to continue “finding weak points” in RF AF defence in Kherson and (possibly) Zaporizhye directions. At the same time, while having sufficient ground forces for a limited offensive, UAF do not have substantial air support and medium-range air defence capable of covering the battlefield from strikes by Russian aviation further than the first line of our defence. Therefore with a timely discovery by our reconnaissance of the accumulation of strike forces of the enemy – it will undoubtedly be possible to stop their efforts. At the same time, the danger of a frontline breakthrough in case of an unexpected strike should not be ruled out. The UAF are learning to fight quickly and the foreign advisors are managing them quite well.",801ac816f09544db4e423fb255ad8f64f793eaef,True,False,,,,,0,1654099954,,0,{},iasuphf,False,t3_v1es7w,False,True,t3_v1es7w,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v1es7w/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_53122/iasuphf/,1654099968,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654071154.0,

Definition of coup d'état (from Merriam-Webster)  
: a sudden decisive exercise of force in politics  
especially : the violent overthrow or alteration of an existing government by a small group

You see the ongoing projects at work with Orban, Trump wanting to quit NATO, Georgia, etc. Eastern European countries know this, and that’s why they need the response to be as painful as possible now without direct NATO intervention, so that Russia doesn’t decide it wants to call NATO’s bluff against a future weaker alliance.

2364,[],False,,Uetur,,,[],,,,text,t2_zwgw6,False,False,"Ah yes, the fabled if only you used ""combined arms"" then that would fix the tanks problem and it would be fine.  Some counterpoints here:

What is the role of the modern MBT?  It appears it is rarely used for tank versus tank engagements.  Its direct fire role may be displaced by drone assisted artillery now.  Is it a heavily armored machine gun?  People defending the tank now are really talking about its role anymore and is it performing that role?  

The T34 in WW2 had similar rates of mechanical failures and losses due to abandonment.  Yet in WW2 the tank was still considered a principal weapon of war.  So, the idea that somehow poor terrain, logistical issues and mechanical failures are somehow unique to this war is probably 100% false.  Quoted from the first article I found on T34s.  

""Vehicle losses to mechanical failures are staggering. In total, over 57,000 T-34s were produced, with 44,900 of these lost. It is reported that 40% of these losses were due to mechanical or logistic failures.""

He kind of glosses over the idea that a bazooka fired 100m and a javelin fires 2000m.  Guerilla tactics are now just way more effective.  Basically to make a tank work you are now needing UAVs, mass infantry, scouting, and air defenses.  This really, really ignores very few countries can actually do this.  

Here is the biggest problem with tanks and Rob mentions it as an important reason for tanks.  Tanks are best on the attack.  He mentions Urban warfare, counterattacks, exploiting success, and assaulting trenches.

In Ukraine we have video after video after video of drone assisted artillery combined with infantry largely assaulting trenches from both sides.  Urban warfare is what armies use to negate some of the strengths of a tank, slow down its advance, allow artillery, drones AGTM teams, and mines all to have maximum effect.  It appears counter attacks and exploiting success is its role, but what makes a tank more effective than a IFV at this?",16631c5e5254adb6a4deed9d3eb756f62f189dc2,True,False,,,,,0,1654098792,,0,{},iasryqu,False,t3_v1es7w,False,True,t1_iars1gw,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v1es7w/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_53122/iasryqu/,1654098810,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654069992.0,

America was at the least funding, coordinating on the ground, and openly supporting the groups carrying out Maidan as well as the demonstrators in general. And that's just what's proven, outside of certain questions about where so many random civilians got rifles from. 

&gt;I give you that Japan has a constitution imposed by the US. But they did lose a massive war to end up there. 

Sure and that's why they're a client state.

&gt;That can't be said of other countries, which don't have a US imposed constitution.

Sure but losing a war and having an openly imposed constitution aren't necessary criteria for being a client state. There's other ways it can happen. 

&gt;If your definition of client state is so wide, what does it matter being a client state at all? 

Well it matters in this arguement because the claim here is Russia could act like all these countries and get along just as well as them. When in fact of the matter is that unlike most of these countries Russia has to manage its own defence and look after its own position, because there's no bigger country that has them under and umbrella and treats them favorably(as opposed to US client states that are treated unfavorably like Haiti). 

&gt;Doesn't mean they follow any of their ""master's"" wishes, it just makes them in receipt of a few economic favours.

Well that's a completely incorrect characterisation. They support America hugely. They vote heavily with the US at the UN, back up American initiatives and geopolitical projects by far more often than not. Most American client states host the US military, providing bases that permit global imperial reach, those with militaries to speak of often join in when America asks in war.

You're defining themfrom scratch, right now, precisely in a way you think will save you here, and not even doing a good job of it. That's not the definition of coup, and English isn't a language with official authoritative definitions for words in the first place.

In actual fact, rather than 3 coldly seperated and technical categories, coup, revolt, and revolution all have heavily overlapping meanings, and the same even can often be described by all 3.

The most salient distinction is that on a scale, connotationally but not in terms of strict definition, coup has the least implications of popular support and legitimacy, revolt somewhere in the middle, and revolution the most. However this is fuzzy; many events in the French Revolution can accurately be called coups, it was certainly a revolt or comprised of revolts, and it was similarly a revolution. 

&gt;Maidan was closer to revolution and/or revolt..

Not a technical distinction. Whatever else you might call it is certainly was a coup, because people with guns intimidated and stormed the sitting government and then unilaterally changed who was in charge. It may also be described as a revolt. Personally revolution in particular would feel wrong because revolution has a connotation of deeply changing the nature and shape of power structures, not just who sits on the top. The French Revolution and Russian Revolution changed the entire shape and nature of government and social life. Before and after Maidan Ukraine was a capitalist country with parliamentary elections and a president, it was just a matter of who was in those seats. 

Most crucially, if we give Maidan the dignity of ""revolt"" or ""rebellion"" then the Eastern seperatists get them too. 

&gt; You can spin it however you like but it still doesn't give Russia the right to annex Crimea and the Donbass.

Not the arguement. Not what we're talking about. You're sour at Maidan accurately being called a coup. That's the point of contention. 

&gt;. Also if there were apparent ""heavy"" anti-Maidan demonstrations throughout the country, why were they seeking to violently separate and join Russia.

Some were, and many just didn't want the government they elected getting couped, their votes negated and overruled undemocratically, and were further protesting against the clearly discriminatory and anti-ethnic russian hostility of the coup regime which removed their languages official status as soon as it took power. 

The Maidan side murdering quite a few of the peaceful anti-Maidan no doubt radicalized many of these people towards outright seperatism however. 

&gt;I didn't see any counter protestors waving Ukrainian flags, though I did see a lot of Russian/Soviet ones. So not exactly a civil war..

Not how it works. Even for arguements sake presuming based on your random say so that no Anti-Maidan protesters, not a single one, waved a Ukranian flag, that's bizarre to think that makes it not a Civil War. Have you ever heard of any Civil Wars? Because the contending sides favouring different flags is actually the norm.

That's why they're called client states, not provinces. 

&gt;that voted in free and fair elections to take their countries in whichever course they want.

I guess you're not as cynical as me on how easy it is to manage and put rails on how the population votes even in what passes for fair liberal elections. It's also just not even true on its own terms. Ukraine voted in a guy who was on good terms with both the West and Russia, and America backed a coup to overthrow him and move Ukraine to firmly being a western client state.

Japan legally cannot have a non defensive military and America has troops there that are distinctly unpopular with the locals, and that is not something Japanese people get to vote against. It's constitutionally fixed. 

It's also more than possible the US was involved in assassinating the most left wing, least pro-american prime minister Sweden ever did manage to elect.

But even that misses the point that you don't have to be forcefully subjugated to be a client state. Countries can willingly subordinate themselves in exchange for favorable treatment and other benefits, not least of which help suppressing dissent in their own populations(very common in non communist Europe post war).


&gt;Some of those countries, like Hungary and to a lesser extent Germany, actively pursue policies heavily against US interests. 

Sure but client state doesn't mean total slave. It doesn't mean everything you do is always *exactly* what your sponsor wants you to do. North Korea gets called a client state of China constantly, but started the Korean War against China's wishes, a much bigger move against their interests than what you're referencing there.",c510c9d9b3221509da4dd15a4c3ac521f40f5a75,True,False,,,,,0,1654095851,,0,{},iasl4xz,False,t3_v1es7w,False,True,t1_iasjkb6,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v1es7w/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_53122/iasl4xz/,1654095865,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654067051.0,

It's only meant for extreme bleeding you cannot control, like amputations or blast wounds, and it's supposed to going a few inches above the wound, *not* at the joint. Because a tourniquet tightened properly starts a 2~3 hour count down on that limb being salvageable as you're supposed to cut off all blood supply (or you can loosen it every 15 minutes I think and re-tighten if you think it'll be longer than 3 hours for rescue or if you think the bleeding can be stopped, but it's been a while since I learnt this).

A **coup** is a seizure of power by the nations military or a small elite group. The sitting government/ruler/King etc is removed and a military regime takes over.  
A **revolt** is violent action taken against someone of authority by its subordinates. So this is much wider then a COUP - which is largely restricted to the MILITARY. In this case if a revolt is undertaken by someone other then the army, they will lack heavy weapons, so this is why a revolt is like a coup, but lacks the necessary heavy weapons of a military. Civilians trying to remove a govt, is not considered a coup (which is the realm of the military), but a revolt.  
A **revolution** differs from the rest, when, not just the sitting authority, but the underlying system is uprooted and replaced. So the overthrow of the monarchy in France in 1789 is called the ‘French revolution’ as it removed and replaced the monarchy.  
Maidan was closer to revolution.. You can spin it however you like but it still doesn't give Russia the right to annex Crimea and the Donbass. Also if there were apparent ""heavy"" anti-Maidan demonstrations throughout the country, why were they seeking to violently separate and join Russia.

They were certainly as free or fair as any elections Ukraine has ever had. CERTAINLY more fair than a coup where you storm government buildings with guns. 

&gt; Yanukovich lost support of the people, his party, and the armed forces, and then promptly fled the country

Not true. Being overthrown in a coup doesn't mean you have no support base. It means there was a coup with heavy presence in the capital. There were heavy anti-Maidan demonstrations throughout the country. 

&gt;The Rada voted 328-0 to remove Yanukovich from his post and to schedule a presidential election for May 25, 2014

That was the regime the regime the coup directly and undemocratically installed voting to have to reroll the election whose results they didn't like. That's routine, it's how coups work. Voting doesn't go your way, launch a coup, reroll the elections that you now get to run, repeat until you like who's in charge. 

&gt; Where was the wide support of the people for Yanukovich? Where were the mass counter-protests, the Ukrainian army clearing Kyiv of protestors in support of the government? The only reactionary movements happened in the East and immediately resorted to violence to achieve their aims at the behest of Russia .

Funny way of answering your own questions there. Yeah, they happened in large numbers throughout ""The East"", in any part of the country where anti-Maidan  existed in the kind of concentrations that they felt they might not get instantly torn apart by Maidan supporters. Not an unfounded fear considering Maidan supporters opened fire on peaceful anti-Maidan protesters and burned dozens of them to death in Odessa. A civil war started. If you suddenly have a civil war, it's a great sign not everyone was on the same page.

&gt;Calling it a coup is convenient excuse for Russia to legitimize their aggression.

Sorry, the truth isn't determined by what's least convenient to Russia. Unfortunately it is convenient to Russia that it was a coup, they do use it as an excuse. It is also, however, the truth.

The only reactionary movements happened in the East and immediately resorted to violence to achieve their aims at the behest of Russia .

Calling it a coup is convenient excuse for Russia to legitimize their aggression. You probably believe Lukashenko won &gt;80% of the popular vote in 2020 in a landslide victory and the mass protests that followed in Belarus were just funded by NATO spies?

First of all, there must be some sort of Russian-lead Latin American defense block with proven track-record of deterring any US aggression, to which it would make sense for Mexico to enter (equivalent to NATO from Ukrainian point of view). Second, there must be recent occupation of Mexican territory by USA, lets say Baja California and Jalisco (equivalent to Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk). Third, there must be some purely Latin-American economic block, that would be much richer, much more prosperous, more free than USA, and to which would be Mexico naturally inclined to align economically (equivalent to EU). 

If these conditions were met, and USA would still try invade whole Mexico just because of possibility of Mexico aligning more with these  Russian-backed Latin American defense and economical alliances (not even by joining them - let me please remind all that Ukraine was not even close to joying neither NATO nor EU when Russia invaded, but most Russian advocates make it look like it already happened), than it would be comparable and equally horrible.

They wanted to join NATO-this in the era where their only war was the First Chechen War, which America supported.. They got refused. They wanted economic integration with the West on friendly, equitable terms. Also refused, the West just wanted tyrannical economic rights to exploit Russia in every way imaginable.

My guess is it has to do with launching method, and has probably quite sophisticated systems. launch is similar to an actual space rocket,  the missile ascends near the Karman line, and falls in a ballistic trajectory, performing evasive maneuvers while diving at hypersonic speed and even releasing decoys to confuse AA defenses.

So you admit that you have no knowledge of the topic at hand then? East Pakistan Rifles and East Bengal Regiment had mutinied.

Some 45,000 Pakistani forces were fighting an all-out Civil War against some 185,000 Mukti Bahini militants for nine months before India got involved.


&gt;What west Pakistan was doing in East Pakistan was GENOCIDE!

Read a book. 

The conflict in East Pakistan wasn't a conflict against some mythical genocidal West Pakistan, it wasn't a fight of liberation against an authoritarian military dictatorship or West Pakistani oppression, it was a civil war of an emerging ethnostate against its minorities, while the more ethnically-diverse Western Wing and the federal government tried to restore order.

The soldiers observed three weeks of complete non-intervention in an anarchy while the leadership carried out negotiations, they had been ordered to take no action even as their fellow brother-in-arms were being killed during something as simple as going out of the base to purchase food items for the rest of the troops and not even Bengali soldiers were being spared, where random nobodies had established checkpoints infront of the entrances into military bases where they were robbing the cash and valuables of anyone trying to enter in clear view of the troops.

No interference as Muhajirs and West Pakistanis were being slaughtered by ethnonationalist militants. 

Finally acting on orders from command, Pakistani forces had launched Operation Searchlight near the end March 1971. This was three weeks after East Bengal went rogue. 

East Pakistan was 2,200 km of Indian territory away. The Pakistan Army had to fly in troops to East Pakistan via Sri Lanka, because India had banned flights between the two wings of Pakistan after an incident of plane hijacking by some Kashmiri nationalists.

The reason I'm explaining this is such detail is to provide context for the following.

They didn't have the manpower to deal with the insurgency, so they employed the use of locals as militants: The Razakers, amongst them were Pro-Pakistan Bengalis, however another large part of these forces were Bihari Muhajirs out for revenge against the massacres and rapes that they had to endure during the three weeks of anarchy.

Even a number of the Pakistani troops themselves lost discipline and were themselves out for revenge in retaliation against the Bengalis after the ethnonationalists in the East Pakistani Rifles and East Bengal Regiment mutinied against West Pakistani officers killing them, brutally murdering their children, raping and killing the women and even impaling Bangladeshi flags into the stomachs of pregnant women and then started killing Muhajirs and West Pakistanis civilians themselves.

&gt;“The air was thick with sombreness...the violence had subsided by then but the hostility was simmering beneath the apparent calm.

&gt;I was posted at the arms supply depot from where ammunition and provisions were supplied to the units...[I heard about the] brutal carnage of non- Bengalis in Chittagong Cantonment and the city [that had taken place before my arrival].

&gt;It sent chills down my spine, wondering if man could be so ferocious...[There were stories of] innocent children being hung upside down and punched to death, of children’s eyes being slashed with blades, women raped and beheaded...men...slaughtered while being told that the blood they had sucked from Bengali veins would come gushing out.

&gt;The Bengali soldiers of Bengal regiments rebelled and arrested all non-Bengalis [and] Chittagong...witnessed the worst brutality. No non-Bengali could manage to survive there. All men and women were indiscriminately killed. Army units of West Pakistan had to take action in response. Military operation started...”

One account from the second day of Operation Searchlight described a Bihari colony that was fighting to keep out angry Bengali nationalists that had attacked them.

The Pakistani army arrived and asked the Biharis to put down their guns to which they complied, except that it was troops who had mutinied against Pakistan and the massacre of the unarmed Bihari Muhajirs would then begin.

Both the Razakars and the Pakistani troops would also carry out war crimes against Bengalis. Neither side had clean hands.

What India did was invade Pakistan's eastern wing during a Civil War and then allow the emerging ethnostate to cleanse the minorities at their leasure by getting rid of West Pakistani interference.

The Muhajirs were mercilessly massacred with no Pakistani forces to prevent it. It's not even talked about what happened to the Bengalis that fought for Pakistan, the Chakma Buddhists, not to mention the Punjabi community in Dhaka.


&gt;Brave west Pakistani troops were only capable of shooting unarmed college professors and raping their daughters.

I'm guessing that you're referring to the alleged events that happened during the raid on Dhaka university where non-Bangalis were being held for ransom and killed if the ransom was not paid and boys were recruited and trained by the Mukti Bahini, there is even an eyewitness who had been kidnapped and held there and would have been killed on the night of the 25th when the army marched in.

There were leaflets being spread in London at the time about the attack at Dhaka university that describes the following:

&gt;""Army entered the women’s hall in Dhaka. There they have not only gunned down many girls but have also committed beastly oppression on them. The 'homosexual' Pathan soldiers have raped the girls in a beastly manner. "" while 50 girls watched from the first floor of the building who committed suicide by jumping when they realized they would be next.

On the 24th there were only 4 girls in the hall.

So there goes any credibility for that claim, or are you referring to the even more ridiculous claim that 470,000 women were raped? 

As for the professors themselves, there is a claim that Pro-Pakistan Bangalis (not Pakistani troops) killed 800 intellectuals on the 14th of December, after well over 40 years later they only have a list of 20.


&gt;When faced against Indian forces, they surrendered in 13 days!!

34,000 Pakistani troops + 11,000 (West Pakistani civilian police, paramilitary, armed non-combatants) + 1 Squadron of 16 jets vs. 185,000 Mukti Bahini + for 262 days. 

In the last 13 out of those 262 days you may add in 250,000 Indian troops and 11 squadrons of 150+ jets and naval blockade against the forces in East Pakistan whose supply lines had already been massively degraded in the course of the insurgency.

Yes, that is the argument from Ignorance. And your argument boils down to ""that's stupid"" which is undercut by your assumption that you know it all aready and your refusal to actually read on the subject. Instead you seem to be demonstrating the opposite. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Let me dumb it down for you

You have successfully dumbed it down with aplomb.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;To remove the distinction between religions, and political ideologies is laughably stupid.

You've claimed this, but not provided any reasoning for saying so. It has as much merit as me claiming, without evidence, that you are a pigeon on a chess board. 

We both understand that spiritual beliefs can form the basis of religions. But to separate ""religion"" (your interpretation) from politics denies the way spiritual belief has always been intertwined with the role of the state since the time of the pyramids. For 5,000 years plus - the distinction between ""religion"" and politics has been blurry.   


The chinese Emperor was a divine figure and his political beauracracy existed to do his divine will - the same with Egyptian Pharoahs, Roman Emperors, even western kings ruled by divine right and were the heads of churches. 

The separation of church and state has only happened in the last few hundred years since the rise of mercantilism and the englightenment. Prior to that philosophy, science, politics and spiritual belief were intertwined.

Even the central claim:

&gt;Worse shit has been done in the name of political ideologies. Drop your fedora somewhere else.

is false, precisely because until 1700's onwards the state and the church were one. You're either ignorant of, or in denial of the terrible things done by the inquisition or the crusades or the ottoman empire, beheadings, genocide, murder, rape, all have been committed in the name of ""religion"" and politics. 

Spiritual belief has created as much ""bad shit"" as political belief, precisely because they are both belief systems and rely on central metanarratives to soldify tribal boundaries by the creation of out groups. Every atrocity attributed to spiritual ideology has been comitted by political ideologies - genocide, murder, rape. Even now Buddhists in Myanmar are ethnically cleansing the Rohingya as the Communists are the Uighur muslims. Buddhists!

What you may be confusing is that political ideologies as belief systems only separated from supernatural belief after the enlightenment and the rise of advanced technology, which has lead to greater access to weapons of mass murder. The difference between murder commited in the name of a supernatural belief system and a political belief system is access to resources. 

Politics is a belief system about how to organise society. It doesn't always lead to religion, anymore than a personal belief in the snake god Glycon. 

Religion is the political economy and culture that surrounds systems of belief when it is shared communally. It doesn't matter if the system of belief derives authority from a supernatural being or a political philosophy. If the practices, devotion, penalties and value systems operate in the same way they are religion. 

Anyway, I'll leave you to revel in pigeoning up that chess board.",089b7c8707bf0e2b5fcd5b20d8b6b79d4a02aad1,True,True,,,,,0,1654088685,,0,{},ias5r0i,False,t3_v1gu1u,False,True,t1_ias0g98,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v1gu1u/isis_senior_commander_explains_his_reasoning_for/ias5r0i/,1654088697,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654059885.0,

Why I think it's normal to choose sides, we're not in a time when 2 countries can simply have a war and it doesn't affect others (or has a minimal effect). The global economy is a complex net with a lot of players interconnected. A war like this one affects a bunch of countries, not just Russia and Ukraine. So a lot of countries are actually participating in the situation whether they like it or not.

In the *hypothetical situation* where Ukraine became a NATO country - keep in mind that Ukraine had an ongoing conflict with Russia before the war, therefore would not be able to join NATO - how would it be an additional threat that does not already exist?

Russia is a nuclear armed power so it has enormous deterrence against being attacked by NATO.

Latvia and Lithuania are *already* NATO countries less than 700km from Moscow.

This is not even about NATO so much as it is about Putin's imperialist dreams of a Greater Russia, which is why his claims focus on denying Ukraine's statehood. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Historical_Unity_of_Russians_and_Ukrainians",cc8ee5fd42e336b494cadc2f3ad5e479819757df,True,False,,,,,0,1654086947,,0,{},ias2jm3,False,t3_v1es7w,False,True,t1_iarytgd,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v1es7w/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_53122/ias2jm3/,1654086963,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654058147.0,

Most people paint the picture of Putin as a mad man. But people forget he's also quite intelligent, he built a system in Russia where he can have absolute power, surrounding himself with an inner circle of close associates that would share the power, and fought any opposition head on. He (and people in power around him) have been exercising a strong international policy, investing in other countries in Europe, and trying to influence politics.

He understands the situation on the ground. He knows that he doesn't stand a chance vs. NATO on his own (unless he's joined by China or India, etc.) - he said it out loud as well. Both in a conventional war and in a nuclear war. And no one benefits from a nuclear one, so even having a threat of a nuclear war will make other countries back down from any conventional war.

Regarding chemical weapons this is a really wrong understanding of the topic. I assume you got it from the link you posted up there, where I read this:

&gt;But if you want to protect a soldier against gas? Well, an state-of-the-art M50 gas mask costs about $270 with a set of filters. A complete NBC (Nuclear-Biological-Chemical) suit \[...\] costs a bit less than that

To make a good analogy, that is like saying: ""To protect yourself from gunfire all you need is a bit of kevlar for 500 $"". After all, it stops all the bullets right? But lets actually think about it:

1. Those filters dont last long.
2. During such an attack you cant do much, you stay put.
3. NBC suits take time to put on (and later off) correctly. Its pretty much impossible in a combat situation with chemical weapons, bombs and rounds floating around. You would need to know it maybe something like a minute befor the stuff arrives to be prepared.
4. Wearing a gas mask isnt fun, you lose capabilitys.
5. Same with NBC suits and you cant really operate when its hot.
6. You can only use these things once in a combat environment if they get contaminated. Decontamination isnt super easy.
7. Everything you carry around has to be air tight sealed all the time to avoid contamination.

Those are just the most basic things to consider. If the enemy uses an odorless chemical weapon like Sarin: How does ""everyone"" even know it was deployed? They cant all have expensive/bulky/... detectors with them. But they also cant wear that gear all the time (logistics, fatigue).

Imagine a longer lasting attack: What if the enemy keeps deploying Sarin for more than 30 min? Filters stop working at some point. Suits can get damaged, but you would need a decontamination chamber to remove it during the attack. Or simple things like how to drink water? Look at health and safety measures (companies deal with nasty chemicals) and where the limits are (like how long to wear a mask etc.).

Its really not that simple to protect yourself, just like with the kevlar vs. gunfire. There wouldnt have been [20'000 dead Iranian soldiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_chemical_warfare#Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_War) in 1988 if it was so easy to protect yourself. You can also look at the other examples in that link.

&gt;Much like what is happening to Russia in Ukraine. When that war is over. It will also be considered a Ukrainian victory.

Dear Lord. So it is just overall inaptitude, not just zeal blinding common sense. You decide outcomes of wars on how you feel they should be. It will be Ukrainian victory if Ukraine manages to retake DPR and LPR. It will be decisive Ukrainian victory if they manage to liberate Crimea as well. It will be a stalemate if Ukraine fails to retake its breakaway oblasts but successfully defends rest of its territories (Alternatively if Russia succeeds in retaining occupation of DPR/LPR/Crimea but fails to change the government in Kiev).",b138731dcb6cffea9e448bb2ab6b720ffa972902,True,False,,,,,0,1654084839,,0,{},iaryzwr,True,t3_v2dlmz,False,True,t1_iary1gu,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v2dlmz/colourized_pakistani_archive_footage_of_1965/iaryzwr/,1654084851,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654056039.0,

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramree_Island

&gt; Originally, the island was a trading post for the Kingdom of Mrauk-U, with fishing villages spread across it. During World War II the Battle of Ramree Island was fought during January and February 1945, as part of the British 14th Army 1944–45 offensive on the Southern Front of the Burma Campaign. At the close of the battle, Japanese soldiers were forced into the marshes surrounding the island, and saltwater crocodiles are claimed to have eaten 400 (or 980 of them, as only twenty survived according to one account)[2] — in what the Guinness World Records has listed as ""The Greatest Disaster Suffered [by humans] from Animals"". However, the veracity of this story has been disputed and the facts suggest that, while a small number of Japanese soldiers were likely killed by crocodiles (the only verifiable mention is of 10-15 men killed by crocodiles while crossing Min Chaung creek near Ramree town), the vast majority likely died due to a variety of other reasons including dehydration, drowning, British gunfire, dysentery, and perhaps even a small number to sharks (Platt et al. 1998).",9c97e12238de7d2d851406a124ce2d5af4cf85fe,True,False,,,,,0,1654084586,,0,{},iarykw1,False,t3_v2eptu,False,True,t3_v2eptu,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v2eptu/ww2_ramree_island_crocodile_massacre_forgotten/iarykw1/,1654084603,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654055786.0,

2. If India won in Western front as well why is it that AJK and GB still stand in Pakistani hands (Remember India did not withdraw from the two villages of Baltistan that they managed to take)? 

3. Which Pakistani cities in West were occupied by India? 

4. How many formations of Pakistan armed forces did India annihlate in West? How many 'surrendered'?

Those numbers are trown around a lot but they're complete bullshit. While a howitzer shell can indeed cause fatal injuries at 70 meters and even beyond, you have to be one unlucky motherfucker to get hit past 40ish meters. 


From the videos I have seen depicting use of artillery in combat, I would say that the reliable kill radius of such ""medium howitzers"" is around 20 meters. Whitin 10 more meters there is a resonable if slim danger of getting hit, and past that you will most likely be fine.

Russia do not have that many spots for beach tourism inside of country. So Crimea now being part of Russia had massively increased inflow of Russian tourists.

This is why I say I don't have a good overview, Crimea being a tourist spot for Russia and increasing the inflow of tourists is definitely better. But taking the numbers at face value doesn't give you an insight into the quality of life or economic situation of the people there. I'm from Croatia and we have places where tourism had a bad impact on the local population and places where it had a really positive impact. Tourism is also heavily sensitive to corruption (you can check some extremes as Seychelles as well), and when you have only Russian tourists it's hard to understand the impact (positive or negative), unless you have solid figures that accompany it.

I've used tourism as a factor here though as, if done correctly, it can boost the local economy as well as have it as a self-sustainable income stream. But it relies on a few more factors.

&gt; As for water which was the last important issue, with Kherson region under Russian control, it is not problem now.

That's why I mentioned ""ok it's fixed now, but"" - having a water issue for 8 years then having it fixed for 3 months, is more of an argument that they've had a really tough situation with negative impacts (I can't assess the impact though). So it being a fix now with Kherson could be a long-term fix if Russia keeps Kherson after the war, but it's not an argument that can be used at all.

&gt; Electricity problems were solved by massive investments, transport infrastructure are much better now than during chronic Ukrainian underfinancing times.

Keep in mind, infrastructure investments are also a good way to launder money, and investments at face value don't mean a lot unless they're applied properly on areas where they are needed the most. From the international reports (not Russian), they haven't been implemented in a normal fashion, rather delayed. If these are true or not, no idea, but it does create some doubts as the size of the investments is quite substantial. Investments can only get you to a one spot, if they're not actually helping the region be self-sustainable, you're digging yourself a hole.

&gt; are much better now than during chronic Ukrainian underfinancing times.

I've seen this narrative produced a bunch of times, so I have doubts if it's simply propaganda or not. If we compare the figures at face value, yes definitely the investments are much more than what Ukraine has provided. But again, how much impact they have on the general quality of life / economic prosperity, I can't find.

&gt; This is why there is complete silence in Ukrainian and western media about situation in Crimea. They generaly report only bad things or silence about Russia.

Keep in mind, I'm an outsider. From that standpoint, I can't trust either side here. West/Ukraine is painting a bad picture (Ukraine trying to go even more on the negative of course) and Russia is trying to paint a positive picture.

From what I've managed to find (feel free to treat me as a nobody here), there's been a lot of investment in Crimea from the annexation, mostly for larger-scale infrastructure projects. Russia claimed Crimea is the fastest-growing region in Russia, economy wise - couldn't find the actual data on the industries that generate this to make an assessment which is simply the bi-product of investments (usually they all are, but want to see the line between being supported by investments and being fueled by investments).

As tourism is an important industry in Crimea, I can't find trustable sources to see the impact there. Covid had a big impact everywhere so hard to trust recent data. From what I've seen, the numbers of tourists are most likely inflated, so we can't trust them at all. It's a messy situation as the sanctions are in place and I guess the annexation is a turn-off for a lot of people outside of Russia. Some reports do show that there's been a large increase of wealthy Russians doing their vacation there.

Aside of that, there are reports of life being harder in Crimea, as well as infrastructure investments not making a big impact (delayed or slowed down). Whether the reports are true or not, hard to really say.

There is definitely an issue with water (from what I've seen it has been fixed now), that make the whole situation much harder, as well as growing food prices (due to being cut from Ukraine) - whether the effect of the two of these has been minimised or not, can't say.",4305beba04d3d6148fca3a53dbb6739581d7b5be,True,False,,,,,0,1654080051,,0,{},iars0gs,False,t3_v1es7w,False,True,t1_iarlnih,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v1es7w/ukraine_discussionquestion_thread_53122/iars0gs/,1654080068,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654051251.0,

I assume you mean the [PKG-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RKG-3_anti-tank_grenade) type grenades? At \~200 mm RHA penetration they are not strong enough for modern tanks. But lets assume a pure warhead is only \~2 kg and can defeat stronger tanks. It (they all) need to point in the right direction and hit the target, at the same time they cant be next to each other (or the APS deafeats them all at once). So they would have to be released, some with more and some with less drag to get some distance on the way. Then they would need to be able to hit the right spot (tank top is rather small). So they need guidance, which costs space, increases mass and $$$. All in all im not sure how easy that is. Not to mention that an APS only needs minor upgrades to defeat multiple targets quickly. 

I still think its going to be some sort of countermeasure to render the APS ineffective during the attack. Like... deploy some chaff and it should be defeated untill the chaff settles. ""All"" of the current ATGMs can then hit from whatever position (not just top).

My point is that ideologies that include atheism are not precluded as belief systems on which civil religions can be founded.

Secular Religion = A communal belief system. 

This term was not ONLY used to describe similarities between secular ideologies and supernatural religions, the secular belief replaces the function of spiritual belief in these ideologies. It can do everything that spiritual belief can do - provide meaning, define tribal boundaries, create a transcendent leader, cement practices and culture, generate myth, create a notion of heaven (in Marxism's case, the idea of the end point of history after Capitalism's fall) and so on. They are not similar, they are the same.

I never said Atheism was a religious ideology. I explicitly said, at the simplest level it is absence of belief in the supernatural. Atheism is an aspect of other ideologies - a position from which other positions flow. 

Marxism is not defined solely by its belief in the supernatural, but in dialectical materialism, the progress of history, its conceptions of exploitation and the nature of capitalism, the economic and material conditions of society etc. Marxism is atheistic, but atheism isn't Marxism.

Ideology isn't religion. It can be the BASIS of religion when it is communal and creates civil structures, culture and practices (rituals) orientated on a central ideology (belief). 

You could always just read some books on the subject instead of pulling it out your arse. There is an entire journal dedicated to political religions (a kind of secular religion) here:

PDF: People’s Defense Force

To give a bit of background, Myanmar’s military forces, called the Tatmadaw, seized power in a coup following independence in the 1950’s. This triggered numerous ethnic minority groups to start armed insurrections in the hopes of gaining independence. These conflicts began to slow in the 90’s, and most of the armed ethnic groups agreed to ceasefires either when the Tatmadaw transitioned to limited democracy in 2010, or when an actual civilian government was elected in 2015.

However, following the 2020 elections in which pro-democracy parties gained an overwhelming parliamentary majority, the Tatmadaw staged a second coup in early 2021. This was met by huge civilian protests in every major city. The Tatmadaw responded by shooting hundreds of protests in the street. Fearing a return to brutal military rule, the ethnic militias resumed their conflict with the Tatmadaw. At the same time, previously neutral villages and urban citizens began to form their own armed groups to fight for democracy, called people’s defense forces (PDFs). A number of powerful ethnic militias decided to ally themselves with the PDFs, agreeing to provide equipment and training in return for promises that a future federalized democracy will allow their people more autonomy. 

The KNLA, who want greater independence for the Karen minority group, is one of the militias that decided to support the PDF’s. The influx of new fighters, combined with the KNLA’s experience and supply networks, have created a serious challenge to the Tatmadaw. While the Tatmadaw still controls major cities, partnerships like this one have seriously challenged, if not outright usurped Tatmadaw control over huge swathes of the countryside.",10aa9d49cf4d3fdd7ab4d745d51ae18ba0bd161b,True,False,,,,,0,1654056745,,0,{},iaqyusy,False,t3_utxhls,False,True,t1_i9grn1m,/r/CombatFootage/comments/utxhls/drone_footage_of_knla_and_pdf_forces_attacking_a/iaqyusy/,1654056757,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654027945.0,

Ukraine's parliament just [fired human rights ombudsman Lyudmila Denisova.](https://ua.interfax.com.ua/news/political/836038.html) MPs claimed her work focusing on the rape of Ukrainians by Russian troops which ""couldn't be confirmed by evidence [...] only harmed Ukraine and distracted the global media from Ukraine's real needs.""

&gt;People's deputies have collected signatures for a vote of no confidence in the Verkhovna Rada Commissioner for Human Rights Lyudmila Denisova, said the spokeswoman of the ""Servant of the People"" faction Yulia Paliychuk.

&gt;The incomprehensible concentration of **the ombudsman's media work on numerous details of ""unnatural sexual crimes"" and ""rape of children"" in the occupied territories, which could not be confirmed by evidence, only harmed Ukraine and distracted the world media from Ukraine's real needs.** After February 24, the current Verkhovna Rada Commissioner for Human Rights spent abroad, but not in Russia or Belarus, where her status and powers could help prisoners, deportees and victims of the occupation of Kherson, and in Davos, Vienna, Warsaw and other warm Western Europe. Ms. Denisova may be fired today, May 31, ""he added.

&gt;The day before, Oleksandr Kachura, a People's Deputy from the Servant of the People faction, told Interfax-Ukraine that the Verkhovna Rada was likely to dismiss Denisova on Tuesday, May 31.

&gt;Earlier at the briefing, Denisova said that on behalf of the President's Office, the collection of signatures of people's deputies began to collect a vote of no confidence in her and dismiss her from office at a meeting of the Verkhovna Rada on May 31.

- **...numerous details of ""unnatural sexual crimes"" and ""rape of children"" in the occupied territories, which could not be confirmed by evidence, only harmed Ukraine and distracted the world media from Ukraine's real needs.**

Apparently the fuck not, eh? Well, she's only just getting the boot in the past few hours, so I guess we'll see if you still trust once you've heard of it, as I'm sure you will have heard, right? This will surely be on the nightly news for correction, right?

Phew, I really was concerned that they would say ""We massage the truth because we are heavily funded by the American military-industrial complex that puppets US foreign policy in order to stoke wars that require our weapons.""

First, yes, policies matter. Deeply. Not only do they apply to the analysts, but also to the board of the institution and independent directors, who are not compensated to any measurable factor by the institution. I understand that governance policies are not something you may understand fully, but could be a fun bit of homework for you. 

&gt; Hate to break it to you on a public forum like this, but think-tanks are not a part of academia.

I refuse to believe you struggle with reading comprehension, but I mentioned the people (the board, fellows and the analysts of the ISW) are generally academics. In fact, this is true for most think-tanks. Keep up, cupcake! 

&gt; Lmao? Does being a 501c3 somehow turn stacks of money from Northrup Grumman and Raytheon into pretty butterflies? They aren't paid by individual posts so their funding source is ""absolutely non relevant"" to their analysis?

You expect people to believe that Raytheon is splurging on pro-war think-tanks out of the kindness of their hearts? Just really supportive defense contractors who have no ulterior motive and just like throwing away money? Only CIA ghouls parrot stuff this hopelessly naive...


You really don’t know how 501c3s work, huh? Lol. How furiously were you googling ;)? So, as a non-profitable charity, they are significantly more likely to be audited. This is the Russian analyst writing most of the stuff that we critique here: 

https://www.understandingwar.org/press-media/staff-bios/mason-clark-0

Yes, the ~24 year old, 3 years out of undergrad is the propaganda mastermind controlling the strings! Or, do you think the puppet master is still hidden behind the curtains? The conspiracies intensify. And Raytheon, who had $64 **billion** in turnover last year, is OH so invested in the ISW who has literally thousands of donors, but has less than $4 **million** in revenue and **pays all of its staff (over 25 people) $2.9 million a year**? Jesus, Sherlock, you’ve cracked the case!! I should be fair to you, that‘s a king’s ransom in Russia and China! 

&gt; Yeah this is completely normal. It's like allied forces quoting German newspapers reporting that the Nazis were in trouble.

I think you *are* struggling with reading comprehension. First, your premise is false because that isn’t what the OP posited. You’re putting your words in his mouth. Second, it still doesn’t address the main point. The analogy is wrong because it doesn’t deal with the inherent biases of changing sources. I know you’re deeply indoctrinated, hence the lack of objectivity, but that’s why the homework I’m assigning would help.

And Russia still has tactical nukes at wich nato can not respond coherently nor surely.
Nato would ahve ti choose if a tactical nuke on ukraine trigger article 5, or it triggers MAD , or nothing?

So a ukranian strike with a ballistic missle has 3 possible results

1) nothing hapoens and you can now launch your extremely limited ballistic missle arsenal on russia targets inside of russia, wich will be mostly protected ans at least a part shit down.

2) Russia drop a tactical nuke in ukraine  and nato triggers MAD destroying humanity

3) same as 2 but nato triggers article5 and invade russia , eventually triggering MAD and destroying humanity.

4)same as 2 but NATO pulls out and ukraine is on theyr own with a nuclear wastland in the middle(highly unprobable but still possible)


Would you bet on it? , if I was a ukranian general i would not, for some limited strike capabilities you are risking nuclear annihilation or losing the support of your allies .

even if russia was always bluffing and it has 0 intention to ever striking ukraine with a tactical nuke, the risk isn't worth it .

maybe if a really really strategical target arises the ukranians may try it ,but it has to be a target that has the potential to end the war ,nithingnless would ve cinsidered worth the risk",30221c6c16dd612c72c9aa922c50f5770b180a11,True,False,,,,,0,1654043500,,0,{},iaq8lcj,False,t3_v234fx,False,True,t1_iaq6rcy,/r/CombatFootage/comments/v234fx/russian_iskander_launches_missiles_and_strikes/iaq8lcj/,1654043516,1,False,True,False,CombatFootage,t5_2v0c6,r/CombatFootage,public,,0,[],,1654014700.0,
