&gt; Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comWASHINGTON, June 1 - The Biden administration plans to sell Ukraine four MQ-1C Gray Eagle drones that can be armed with Hellfire missiles for battlefield use against Russia, three people familiar with the situation said.

&gt; Arming the drones with Hellfire missiles will be done via a future Presidential Drawdown Authority once training on the drones has been completed, the U.S. official and one of the sources said.

&gt; Up until an announcement on Wednesday that Ukraine would get four HIMARS rocket systems, the Pentagon has stressed that smaller systems such as Javelin anti-tank systems and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, which allies are shipping to Ukraine via truck near-daily, are most useful.

You cannot reason with a MADMAN. And Trump couldn't even define the word ""reason"". What you expect is ""concessions"" for aggression and Putin is the aggressor. Sorry... you don't pay off a bully, you kick their asses. 

President Joe Biden did not invade Ukraine. Putin did, the Russian Generals did and all will pay a price in the life and hopefully for eternity after this life. 

Joe Biden didn't bomb kindergartners and maternity hospitals, Putin did.

Putin has the Deaths of thousands to his credit and the colossal economic destruction of Russia and diplomatic and INTELLIGENCE IGNORANCE.   

Putin is going to either be killed or die of cancer as his couintry is set back 30 years economically.

[],False,,ArmChairAnalyst86,,,[],,,,text,t2_hj938hzd,False,False,"I did not insinuate that they are being trampled in any way. Quite the contrary, their fierce and determined defense of their country has been nothing short of inspiring and valiantly fought off the initial invasion force in central Ukraine. In fact, if they had everything they needed, I speculate that Russia may have already went home, but they dont, and the west isnt going to give them anything that Russia objects to as evidenced by the aircraft and long range HIMARS munitions being refused. 

The facts on the ground are that Ukraine has been forced to retreat from another vital strategic location, in addition to the loss of territory incurred in the south. Russia is not trampling them by any means, by all accounts the advance has been slow and bloody, but has advanced none the less. I consider Mariupol and Seveirodonetsk as major cities and major strategic locations to whoever holds them. Also, the villages and towns you mention, not very significant in themselves, however holding them has allowed Russia to install no less than 3 lines of defense in the east. 

I am a practical person and a realist, and Russia has taken the momentum from Ukraine. We need to be real about this, because anything less is a disservcice. The situation is very urgent, and Ukraine is in a perilous position like you said. If it were my decision, I would have already given them everything they asked for short of direct intervention and dared Russia to escalate if for nothing else than to not appear weak and embolden them. Each time a piece of hardware is refused, Putin no doubt chuckles to himself. 

My whole point was truth. The story about the Russian military collapsing any day now has been repeated since week 2. Nothing on ground suggests this is imminent, and on the contrary, they are taking momentum. Not only that but they have circumvented sanctions successfully to this point. I was very encouraged by the early phase of the war, but this phase is not going nearly as well. 

Ukraine appears to be LOSING this war currently, and now a decision must be made. We cant confuse a spirited and fierce resistance as actually winning the war. Ukraine is losing territory and Russia is gaining it, despite a high cost. It is as simple as that. 

Ante up or get out of the way, because half supporting them is only making things worse. Its like giving them a 6 foot ladder for a 10 foot climb. Borderline useless and offensive to Ukraine. No doubt they appreciate any and all help they get, but I can imagine Zelenskys exasperation with the west, who have said all the right things, but the delivery on those things has been less consistent.",e145c7b3cec686afd54f45ea57900a47a2b73b94,True,False,,,,,0,1654103838,,0,{},iat40hg,False,t3_v1qe77,False,True,t1_iasdiwr,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/v1qe77/russian_army_on_brink_of_collapse_as_putin_loses/iat40hg/,1654103850,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1654075038.0

My mistake.

If Iraq wanted to kick out 2,500 people, they could.

&gt;And no - Russia‚Äôs actions are perfectly justifiable.  It was America that overthrew Ukraine‚Äôs democratically elected governments in a violent coup. Russia‚Äôa naval base at Sevastopol was threatened.

After Yanukovych stabbed the Ukrainian population in the back.  You don't get to see a puppet kicked out and then go annexing territory because it isn't willing to be a puppet state.  The US didn't ""overthrow"" Yanukovych, Ukraine did.  He's not exactly a popular figure there right now.

&gt;In contrast Iraq was no threat to America in any way shape or form. The Americans made up a lie about WMDs to invade even when the inspections regime told them there was no evidence of WMDs. And what do you now? No WMDs we‚Äôre found.

*Ukraine* wasn't a ""threat"" to Russia!  Russia was never going to be fucking invaded by Ukraine with or without Yanukovych, what kind of nonsense is this?

Yes, Bush lied about WMD's, and got the US stuck in a prolonged quagmire.  That does nothing to justify Russian territorial expansion.

What the fuck, quit with the whataboutism.

Hell, forget Iraq, because Vietnam is the more interesting case study.

The US really, *really* was afraid of Vietnam being ""taken over"" and made into a puppet state of China.  It involved a *profound* misunderstanding of actual Chinese-Vietnamese relations, even among the respective communist blocs.

It was Vietnamese fears of Chinese *expansionism* that ultimately pushed Vietnam into adopting ""pro-western"" stances, even *after* the US bombed them to shit in what can only be called a geopolitical fuckup of epic proportions coupled with atrocities too numerous to mention.  That war just served as an incentive to push the Vietnamese *closer* to China.

The war was counter-productive to geopolitical objectives, and in *spite* of that, the US did not represent as large a threat to the Vietnamese as the Chinese did while US ordinance was still being dug up from the ground following the war.

That's Russia right now.  Russian aggression and Russian attempts to exert control have pushed Ukraine away.

WASHINGTON ‚Äî The Russian military, beaten down and demoralized after three months of war, is making the same mistakes in its campaign to capture a swath of eastern Ukraine that forced it to abandon its push to take the entire country, senior American officials say.

While Russian troops are capturing territory, a Pentagon official said that their ‚Äúplodding and incremental‚Äù pace was wearing them down, and that the military‚Äôs overall fighting strength had been diminished by about 20 percent. And since the war started, Russia has lost 1,000 tanks, a senior Pentagon official said last week.

President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia appointed a new commander, Gen. Aleksandr V. Dvornikov,¬†in April¬†in what was widely viewed as an acknowledgment that the initial Russian war plan was failing.

Soon after his arrival, General Dvornikov tried to get disjointed air and land units to coordinate their attacks, American officials said. But he has not been seen in the past two weeks, leading some officials to speculate as to whether he remains in charge of the war effort.

Russian pilots also continue to demonstrate the same risk-averse behavior they did in the early weeks of the war: darting across the border to launch strikes and then quickly returning to Russian territory, instead of staying in Ukrainian air space to deny access to their foes. The result is that Russia still has not established any kind of air superiority, officials said.

The Russian military has made some progress in the east, where concentrated firepower and shortened supply lines have helped its forces fight intense battles in recent days. After three bloody months, Russia¬†finally took Mariupol¬†in mid-May, potentially creating a land bridge from the Russian-controlled Crimean Peninsula to the south.

As Russia struggles to move forward, Ukraine has also suffered setbacks. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine recently said that as many as 100 Ukrainian servicemen might be dying every day in the fighting. And on Tuesday, Russian troops¬†advanced toward the center of Sievierodonetsk, a city that has become a central focus for the military since it shifted its attention to the east.

But some of the areas that Russian forces managed to seize have been quickly contested again, and sometimes retaken, by Ukrainian troops.

Consider Kharkiv. Russia spent six weeks bombarding the eastern city, once home to 1.5 million people, as troops encircled it.

But by May 13, control of the city had flipped again. ‚ÄúThe Russians took Kharkiv for a short period of time; the Ukrainians counterattacked and took Kharkiv back,‚Äù Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III said at a news conference at the Pentagon last week. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen them really proceed at a very slow and unsuccessful pace on the battlefield.‚Äù

Ukraine is now pushing Russian troops north and east from Kharkiv, ‚Äúin some cases all the way back to Russia,‚Äù said retired Gen. Philip Breedlove, the former supreme allied commander for Europe. ‚ÄúSo now Ukrainians are threatening to cut off Russian lines of supply and pushing their forces to the rear.‚Äù

Cutting off Russian supply lines east of Kharkiv would put Russian troops in the same situation they were in after their advance on Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, at the beginning of the war, officials said. Ukrainian units carrying shoulder-fired Javelin antitank missiles picked off Russian soldiers as miles-long Russian convoys near Kyiv stopped moving forward. The invasion stalled, and thousands of Russian troops were killed or injured. Russia then refocused its mission on the east.

In the early weeks of the war, Russia ran its military campaign out of Moscow, with no central war commander on the ground to call the shots, American and other Western officials said. In early April, after Russia‚Äôs logistics and morale problems had become clear, Mr. Putin put General Dvornikov in charge of a streamlined war effort.

General Dvornikov arrived with a daunting r√©sum√©. He started his career as a platoon commander in 1982 and later fought in Russia‚Äôs brutal second war in Chechnya. Moscow also sent him to Syria, where the forces under his command were accused of targeting civilians.

In Ukraine, he established a more streamlined process. Russian pilots began coordinating with troops on the ground toward a similar objective in the eastern region of Donbas, and Russian units were talking to one another about shared goals.

But the invasion is not ‚Äúproceeding particularly differently in the east than in the west because they haven‚Äôt been able to change the character of the Russian army,‚Äù said Frederick W. Kagan, a senior fellow and director of the Critical Threats Project at the American Enterprise Institute. ‚ÄúThere are some deep flaws in the Russian army that they could not have repaired in the last few weeks even if they had tried. The flaws are deep and fundamental.‚Äù

At the top of that list is the Russian army‚Äôs lack of a noncommissioned officers corps empowered to think for itself, Pentagon officials said. American troops have sergeants and platoon leaders and corporals who are given tasks and guidelines and left to accomplish those tasks as they see fit.

But Russia‚Äôs military follows a Soviet-style doctrinal method in which troops at the bottom are not empowered to point out flaws in strategy that should be obvious or to make adjustments.

The Ukrainians, after seven years of training alongside troops from the United States and other NATO countries, follow the more Western method and have proved particularly agile at adapting to circumstances, American military officials said.

A two-week fighting pause after the Russian military gave up the fight for Kyiv was not long enough to turn the campaign around, even with a more limited goal, General Breedlove said. General Dvornikov‚Äôs ‚Äúnew tactics, resetting the command and control so there was a focused decision maker ‚Äî all that was right or proper,‚Äù he said.

But, General Breedlove added: ‚ÄúEven our army would be hard-pressed to refit, refurbish and reorganize in two weeks after having received such a sound whipping.‚Äù When General Dvornikov took control, ‚Äúthe force was thrust back into the battle too quickly. That decision had to have come from Moscow.‚Äù

After renewing an assault on the Donbas, Russia has pounded cities and villages with a barrage of artillery. But troops have not followed that up with any kind of sustained armored invasion, which is necessary if they will hold the territory they are flattening, military officials say. That means that Russia may find itself struggling to hold on to gains ‚Äî as it did in Kharkiv.

Evelyn Farkas, a former senior Pentagon official for Ukraine and Russia in the Obama administration, said Mr. Putin was still too involved in the fight.

‚ÄúWe keep hearing accounts of Putin getting more involved,‚Äù said Ms. Farkas, who is now executive director of the McCain Institute. ‚ÄúWe know that if you have presidents meddling in targeting and operational military decisions, it‚Äôs a recipe for disaster.‚Äù",5d75640506ec98c3be6a8a4916fe0f8a5afcff99,True,False,,,,,0,1654060154,,0,{},iar4454,True,t3_v293ji,False,True,t3_v293ji,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/v293ji/russian_military_is_repeating_mistakes_in_eastern/iar4454/,1654060165,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1654031354.0

I've had debates with the Russian propagandist. I've heard in great detail their reasons for this war. There's no middle ground to be had with them. They are resolute in their ridiculous justifications, as if that were even possible. Claiming to be wronged in every conceivable manner and the only recourse is death, destruction, and war on civilians. ""We didn't do that, but if we did, it was your fault.""

Their entire argument is built around the hypocrisy of the west. It's the one kernel of truth in their argument. Lets not pretend the perception of the US was in any type of good standing before this conflict. Failed wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and countless surgical strikes on sovereign nations soil along the way. Understandably short on friends in some areas.

Saying that the US did this or that doesnt make genocide or forced relocation, leveling of entire cities, rape and murder on a massive scale okay. If it looks evil, smells evil, probably is evil. 

I've come to see the nazi aspect of really just a lazy but effective way to sell it at home. Their target audience abroaf is aware that Ukraine and the west aren't ""nazis"", considering the definition of a Nazi. It's for domestic consumption as something universally hated by all Russians. 

The truth is alot harder sell, even when all one needs is a reasonable doubt. Genocide of Ukraine, to be replaced by Russian speaking peoples under the guise of denazification despite not existed en masse since actual WWII. Russia disagrees, but a spade a spade, see definition of genocide. They most certainly were not greeted as liberators.

The west needs to invest in some truth as well. Ukraine is losing this war. We need facts and reporting, not speculation about when the wheels are coming off. Nothing on the ground suggests this is imminent, and on the contrary, Russia is picking up steam.

How far is the west willing to go here and to what end? Have said all the right things, but moment of truth coming. The west can either get out of the way in draped in appeasement and decrying accounting purposes or they can give Ukraine exactly what they need to at least hold the line. Either decision has consequences. Sort of a lose lose.

The worst decision would be to remain ambiguous until half of Ukraine is gone. This ensures a worst of both worlds and is likely the desired outcome for Russia. 

Zelensky is tired of addressing parliaments to standing ovations. Russia will exploit any weakness or division, knowing that democracy has disagreement where dictatorship is absolute. 

Meanwhile there is so much discord in the US, it's a wonder we can get anything done anywhere else. It makes me queasy to contemplate the Chinese waging economic warfare while Russia sews chaos and forces change through conflict.

We often have to make choices based on degrees of good or bad. I suppose if I were gay, I would probably dislike Putin more than Zelensky perhaps because Putin is worse on gay rights than Zelensky. Zelensky may not be great, but I can see how it would be possible to see one as worse than the other. For an extreme example, neither Mike Pence nor the Islamic State are particularly supportive of gay rights. But Mike Pence doesn‚Äôt throw gays off buildings.

I also think maybe it‚Äôs possible to see Russian aggression as the more pressing issue here. Again, I‚Äôm not gay, but I can imagine that gays think about other issues than just gay rights. Putin has twice invaded Ukraine, carpet bombed Chechnya and poisoned political opponents on foreign soil. Someone who stands up to him is going to be fairly popular among anyone who objects to those things Putin has done.

Finally, I would answer your question with one of my own. Why would freedom-loving people admire Winston Churchill? During the Second World War, Churchill‚Äôs government imposed severe restrictions on speech, commerce, and other basic rights. But I think most people realize that any figure in history is complicated (as all humans are). It‚Äôs easy to look at just one aspect of an historical figure and be against them, but most of us can look at the whole person and their circumstances and still approve of them, even if there are individual actions they have taken that we object to.",9578f23cb1737f60468aaf89eec2de7ef0ce953f,True,False,,,,,0,1654057131,,0,{},iaqzhh5,False,t3_u9yne8,False,True,t1_iaqyhmj,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/u9yne8/lets_all/iaqzhh5/,1654057146,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1654028331.0

[],False,,TheTheoristHasSpoken,,,[],,,,text,t2_kzwpoeza,False,False,"     Of course there is the risk that this war could result in a catastrophic nuclear exchange between NATO and Russia, and possibly China if the cards fell as such, but I think there is some hesitancy in Russia's elite circles and even in Putin's mind. Don't get me wrong, I 100% believe he would use them... but I'm not sure he feels he can use them or would be able to use them effectively. Perhaps Putin has his reasons to doubt using nukes. Of course, there's no citable proof to offer; but I wouldn't at all be surprised if the U.S. has the capabilities to prevent their missiles from either being launched properly, or from landing where they want them to. 
     I applaud the U.S. for supporting our Ukrainian brothers and sisters. I, too, believe more could be done. But this brazen forwardness and outright cockiness of the USA and NATO nations has pushed Putin and his inner circle into doubt and confusion. This was not the response they were expecting AND, in fact, needing from The West. They wanted Trump to win  because they felt they had an ally (of sorts) in the White House. Trump had shown that he wasn't wanting to support NATO (he questioned the reasons for being in NATO and wanted to pull out); and he had shown repeatedly that he had no interest in helping Ukraine. But then Putin's puppet lost and the USA's leadership fell to an old man that was feeble of mind and weak of will -or so they thought. They didn't know that Biden is a policy wonk and will follow the book as it's written.   This wasn't Biden's pre-presidential profile; yet, he has shown resolve and has maintained a steadfast refusal to back down against Russian agression. The playbook states that when you get pushed by a bully you push back even harder. If he didn't learn his lesson, then you MAKE him learn his lesson. If Putin sends nukes, then NATO sends nukes. Make no mistake, the U.S. will nuke Russia if it gets hit. Biden will ride NATO right over Russia if it attacks any inch of NATO. Instead of studying Biden's political career and realizing that he was a by-the-book kinda guy, Russia bit into the conservative right's continuous propaganda(ish) attempts to assassinate Biden's character and mental capabilities to govern the country effectively. Democrats have long been considered weak willed and peaceful liberals that are scared of conflict. He fell victim to his orange puppet's rhetoric. The election's coup attempt only further emboldened Putin as he felt sure that a disunified NATO and a weak Dove Democrat, embroiled in domestic political headaches of his own, would prevent the USA (and therefore, NATO) from getting involved.

Obviously, Putin was wrong. NATO is united as tighter than ever before; NATO is more capable than ever before; Biden ain't backing down; and Ukraine has bitch-slapped Russia into  pariahdom for generations to come. His people are not as supportive as he needs them to be. Look at the OP. There are many Russians that feel this way. Usually the younger generation. This propaganda shit is consumed mostly by poor and older people that tend to only watch state tv, and listen to state radio stations, and those who don't know how to bypass the State's blocks and restrictions on their internet activity.",ef86b91f32f2da97cd03053b9e987df026dbbe06,True,False,,,,,0,1654050267,,0,{},iaqms74,False,t3_v1m2k9,False,True,t1_iaqdz5f,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/v1m2k9/skabeyeva_announced_the_end_of_the_special/iaqms74/,1654050286,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1654021467.0
