[],False,,the_propagandapanda,,,[],,,,text,t2_qk62c66,False,False,"Both this post and your last one conveniently ignores the fact that Ukraine has had their official bid to join NATO in since 2008. They have never changed their stance since. It’s not a zelensky thing it’s been in the works for over a decade. You say people have spoken against it but so what? There are always going to be two sides to a decision like that. The majority of Ukrainians still seemed to support the decision. Unless you can provide numbers showing otherwise to support your claim then you’re just making shit up. 

Back to 2008: why didn’t Russia invade then? The answer seems simple to me. This is about Putin and wanting to reclaim land for Russia and they have simply been chipping away at it for years. Them joining NATO is just their excuse for doing something they were going to do anyway. 

Nobody is glorifying NATO and I don’t know where you’re getting that idea from. NATO has been dragged through the mud in recent decades for what’s been done in the Middle East, Arabian Peninsula, and Central Asia. NATO isn’t being glorified but it’s being seen as an essential defense mechanism for countries close to Russia. Why would a country not take steps to avoid being invaded? State media in Russia has claimed many times that it won’t stop at Ukraine. Considering Russia has now invaded Ukraine multiple times it’s pretty obvious the surrounding countries will want protection. 

Also where are you getting that zelensky is a war criminal? What has he done? Genuine question. Obviously the Ukrainian military isn’t going to come out of this clean. No military ever does. But what point directly at him? He’s not being called a hero because he’s a perfect person who never did anything wrong. It’s because he’s staying in country in cities that are actively being attacked and supporting his people and soldiers. He’s done something many countries leaders wouldn’t do. 

Also your Syria comparison is awful and (to me at least) makes you seem like you have absolutely no idea what’s going on there or Ukraine. You’re asking why the west isn’t arming Syria. They are and I don’t know what makes you say they aren’t. The difference is the Syrian government WANTS Iranian and Russian bases there. Why would the West provide weapons to a government that supports the people they want out? 

I’ll just simply tell you to look up the situation in north eastern Syria and the SDF. The West not only is supplying weapons and funding but they did you one better.

I cannot speak for everyone, but there is clearly a possibility that there is some corrupt shit going on between Ukraine and the US/NATO, and if that is the case then so be it, but on a provable note, there are people actually dying, being raped, and tortured, on account of this war/invasion, so there isn't much time to worry about peoples speculation when your citizens are being slaughtered. 

Concerning Zelenskyy's likeability, from what I have seen, and in the context that there isn't major fraud and corruption going on, Zelenskyy is a beacon of hope and leadership for the people of Ukraine and he seems to be transparent in his love for his people and the lengths he will go to remind them of it. He has had the opportunity to get out Ukraine on multiple occasions, to get a full nights rest in a comfy bed without worrying about mortars coming through his roof-but he has not, he has stayed with his people, on the front, having many sleepless nights and facing the possibility of a snipers bullet in his head. 

He is a leader, one of which this generation desperately needs, and one that Ukraine is lucky to have amidst these very trying times. 

I completely understand the conspiracy speculation, because given everything going on in the world, it would not be a surprise.

[],False,,pezboy74,,,[],,,,text,t2_64h50ya5,False,False,"1) Most likely end - it won't soon - it'll be like the 2014 Donbas fighting. The two sides will settle into new frontlines and a low-energy war will keep going for years, artillery duels and patrols with occasional renewed fighting in areas. Russia will declare the area they hold theirs and Ukraine and the world won't recognize it. At some point the endless drain on Russia's resources and the sanctions will force Russia to negotiate. If the Ukraine public gets exhausted enough of the fighting they may find losing Crimea or parts of the Donbas acceptable and they will find a middle ground that they both agree to just to end the war. Time line - Years 2028-2030?  
2) Putin goes to full war footing or is removed from power by hard liners - Russia goes to full war footing and grinds through Ukraine's army via attrition Ukraine falls back and holds the highly defensible western part of the country and moves its capital to Lyiv. Unlikely but possible as something that happens for a while before one of the lower options happens. The world tires of the war and slowly either sanctions are lifted, ignored and Russia finds new trade partners. In the long term Russia has gained most of Ukraine but relegates itself to a slow decent into irrelevance in the process. Time line - Years 2024-2026   
3) Putin dies or is removed from power by realists/oligarchs - There is a very real risk of mini Russia civil war in this case but if the realists/oligarchs manage to hold power, the negotiate for a high speed exit from Ukraine and removal of sanctions with maybe some concessions in Crimea. Time line - very fast 2022?  
4) Unlikely but always a possibility - Ukraine units after 4-5 months of near constant fighting have a break down in morale and lose command and control of their army. Its happened in more than one past war - one major unit has a collapse of morale and routs off the front line, this infects the rest of the army like a virus. Some Ukraine units are having morale issues but a very small scale, and the soldiers of the Ukraine Army know why they are fighting and believe they have a chance to at least stop Russia from taking more land as well some units are experience success in their attacks which is the greatest morale booster.

It is among the most economically and socially stable nations in South America, leading Latin America in rankings of competitiveness, per capita income, globalization, state of peace, and economic freedom.[16] Chile also ranks high regionally in sustainability of the state, democratic development,[17] and has the lowest homicide rate in the Americas after Canada. It is a founding member of the United Nations, the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) and the Pacific Alliance, and joined the OECD in 2010.
