While this is true, it also invites escalation that has the threat of bogging down the US in (yet another) European war. While you might say ""Russia is a paper tiger, we have nothing to fear"" - that's not the stance the Pentagon has taken. There's been a real reluctance to provide certain platforms and capabilities to Ukraine out of that *exact* concern. So either the contention is that escalation fears are not real (possible) or that we can manage escalation with Russia while also pivoting to China (highly unlikely). Both options are extraordinarily risky.

For the US, the current strategy (keeping things just below the level of escalation) is phenomenally good in terms of return on investment. For a few billion dollars and a bunch of old equipment gathering dust in a warehouse, you get to kneecap one of your main adversaries for the next decade at least.

If armchair general refers to analysts that aren't affiliated with the Ukrainian military (AKA basically everyone we mention in these threads), then sure, I guess?  But analysis is what most western figures are relegated to at this point, and there's enough data to come up with theories, and a lot of credible analysts have.

I'm not sure if Arestovych ever explicitly said what their strategy was in the Donbas, but he has said that they intend to fight for every inch of land they can, and that their ""big opportunity"" will come when (if) Russia peters out and simultaneously when (if) sufficient western aid for a counterattack arrives.  Not to mention a constant theme in his reports was ""time is on Ukraine's side""

I don't know if this amounts to your ""defense in depth"", but materially, the two things Ukraine could gain from continuing their defense strategy in Ukraine are time and Russian casualties/equipment attrition.  I think it was (and is) reasonable to assume that since Ukraine is continuing their current strategy those are.

But if Ukraine's taking similarly large casualties, I'm not sure they're actually gaining time, or differential attrition.

According to whom? The number of aimpoints, tens of thousands in a large operation, will require thousands of individual strike sorties alone to hit. This is not counting other sorties including jamming, SEAD, counter-air, ISR, refueling, and transportation, which add thousands more sorties to any campaign. So yes, any such air campaign will last days to weeks.

PGMs have significantly reduced the number of strike sorties from multiple sorties per target to multiple targets per sortie. But when you have ten thousand aimpoints...

Additionally, there are concerns about if the US PGM inventory is robust enough to support such a campaign without badly diminishing our ability to support other operations.

&gt;The Abrams actually does have much more armor and is much more survivable against ATGM threats than Russian tanks.

Both modern variants of Abrams and the T-72 and T-80 series have very good frontal protection against most ATGM threats. Generally speaking, few if any models of ATGMs will have a high probability of defeating these vehicles from the front. However, side shots will have a much greater ability to penetrate either type, though this varies greatly from engagement to engagement. Neither vehicle has much of any protection against top attack ATGMs however, and these munitions are considered a major threat.

Where the Abrams really differs is post-penetration survivability, which is a feature the design strongly emphasizes. As has been well documented, a hit to the ammo rack on the Abrams will typically result in mission kill, while the crew remains protected. Whereas the Russian propensity to launch their turrets into orbit is quite infamous.

&gt;The US also has much better armored doctrine and supporting movements with air cavalry scouting or infantry route clearance beforehand.

One would have thought the lessons of Grozny would have stuck with Russia.

&gt;The US also has the capability to launch extensive airmobile operations and launch deep strikes deep within enemy territory to achieve rapid operational goals.

Or they will just get themselves Hostomel'd.

&gt;A long air campaign is actually counter-productive to achieving rapid operational success of the ground offensive and limiting casualties.

I don't think many will agree with that at all. The prevailing view is that the need for preparatory fires, whether by land, air, or sea based assets, is only growing. The ability to degrade enemy logistics and C2 capabilities in particular remains as important as ever, but the complexity of engaging many kinds of targets is becoming greater.",b02e58fabc07df0dab2b57f39d98ac47f2b7ebf6,True,False,,,,,0,1654126721,,0,{},iaul71y,False,t3_v1tu0r,False,True,t1_iaq0r6m,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v1tu0r/would_we_do_better_hubris_and_validation_in/iaul71y/,1654126734,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654097921.0,[],text,t2_7u1jf,False,False,

Weren't the online armchair generals the ones who popularized the idea that the UA were planning to fight a defense in depth to trade space for Russian casualties to bleed them? Or did the UA govt actually say that was their plan? 

Even if they did say that at some point, what it seems like from watching this is that's not the plan, it's more of a desperate linear defense where they aren't surrendering any ground unless they absolutely have no alternative option. Fighting defensively like that is massively costly in manpower and equipment, always has been and always will be.

If NATO starts being serious and stops taking months to deliver weapon systems it should have been sending from day one, then very much yes.

[APCs and tanks happened reasonably quickly, and in decent numbers](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/04/answering-call-heavy-weaponry-supplied.html). It took until May to start sending meaningful amount of artillery (and it's still a lot less than needed), until June to start sending MLRSs, still very little antiair, and NATO will be discussing combat aircraft deliveries for months more.

Same with sanctions, EU took until June to even do slow phased-in oil embargo, that should have happened in 2014.

Now Ukraine will fight and win anyway, as it really has no choice. It can't afford to let Russia do a repeat in a few years, so it will keep fighting until it kicks Russians out.

As it is, I'm starting to have serious doubts. Not doubts that Ukraine would be able to take back everything in the end, but doubts if their society would be prepared to pay the price for this when this war goes into it's second, it's third, etc. year. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's why I'm thinking that: 

* Whatever happens, I consider it unlikely that Ukraine will ever attain air superiority in this war - while suffering painful losses, the RuAF is not being attrited away anytime soon, and Russia still got a massive air defence network 
* Without air superiority, any counter-offensive is going to be costly - very costly. Basically all successful offensives in modern history employed air superiority, and those which didn't (Battle of the Bulge) weren't succesful 
* So let's say Russia culminates eventually and goes on the defensive - Ukraine now needs to take back its country, one very bloody meter at a time 
* That takes a lot of time, a lot of blood, and here's the problem - Russia will use that time to continue shooting missiles at them 
* So while all of this is going on, Russia will continue lobbing cruise missiles at them - yes, they're running out of them currently because for the lack of spare parts, but they will eventually find alternatives
* As long as Russia lobs missiles at them, Ukraine won't have (for all intents and purposes) an economy - yes, they'll be on Western life support, but that's it 
* And (at least according to the political situation right now), Ukraine will not be able to retaliate - so while Ukraine is under missile bombardment, Russia is not and is, for all intents and purposes, fighting an expeditionary war
* What Russia will face are growing casualty numbers and also economic starvation, but Putin will be more than willing keep sending soldiers in the furnace to accept the former, and he also might be able to convince his people of stubbornly accepting the latter 
* In such a scenario, it ultimately comes down to tenacity - who's more willing to endure pain, the Ukrainians to get their territories back, or the Russians to deny them the same? 

&amp;#x200B;

There might be a point, a year, two years, three years into the war when the Ukrainian population will want to call it quits, even at the loss of territory, just to get a normal life back. There might also not be, and Russia might cave in earlier. 

But honestly? I personally think the chances are actually more like 60:40 in Russia's favor if it comes down to a game of ""who's willing to accept the cost in lifes and prosperity for longer to keep this war going"".

Another is that Russians are conducting far more cautious advances lately, which amount to probing attacks. Movement to contact against a fixed defensive position typically means platoons advancing by bounding overwatch until a defender engages them, at which point the attacker tries to survive while finding out where they were fired upon from, giving them intelligence on another enemy fighting position or potential stronghold. Using tanks for that theoretically means better protection than APC or IFV but not if the tanks themselves don't have any better survivability against the typical AT weapons. Or they're trying to preserve the tanks for other uses, so best use the more easily replaced and less costly vehicles. This also works well if they already didn't have a lot of dismounts left, at the point only the crew are inside the BMP, BTR, or BMD it's already effectively a light tank or recon vehicle at that point. 

Russian doctrine has what is called Reconnaissance Fire Complex, which is a fancy way of saying a precision fires centric form of tactical maneuver where ground and aerial recon elements finds targets for responsive and accurate arty and airstrikes to hit, either destroying them or suppressing them to allow ground elements to destroy them, or bypass them. It's supposed to be tech focused with drones finding targets and immediately calling fires on them, but ground forces also can do it.

[],False,,thereddaikon,,,,,,"Because an old tank has the logistics footprint of a new tank. It's going to require similar fuel, ammunition and spare parts as a newer, better tank for less effectiveness. So it's inefficient. And in the case of the T-62 it's less efficient in terms of man power because it has a four man crew instead of a three man crew. It also uses a gun that nothing else in the active Russian inventory uses, the 115mm. That gun was a transitional model between the 100mm of the T-54/55 and the 125mm the Soviets settled in starting with the T-64. So I'm sure the Russian logistics system, infamous as it is, will have lots of fun supplying them. My bet is parts and ammunition will have a hard time getting to the right place. 

Ok, you say, don't use it as a tank. Use it as an assault gun. The fact it's less capable doesn't matter because it isn't fighting tanks. And it has a big gun that can still blow shit up. 

War doesn't work that way. You don't get to decide what it does or doesn't fight. If there are enemy tanks in the area then you have to contend with them.

 And that's where the discussion of armor becomes relevant. The T-62's armor in the context of this conflict is stupid. Armor isn't a linear thing where more is always better. You design for specific threats in mind. And in the case of AFVs you design something to be protected against anti armor weapons or not. The T-62 was designed with protection against anti tank weapons....from the 1950s. Virtually any antitank weapon it can come across in Ukraine will be able to frontally defeat it at any reasonable combat distance. That means the tank guns, ATGMs and even simpler unguided rocket launchers like AT4 and Panzerfaust 3 can kill a T-62. Easily. So it's armor is practically no better than that on an IFV. Because anything that can kill an IFV in this war will probably kill a T-62. And anything that won't kill an IFV in this war, won't kill a T-62. But instead of weighing 13 tons, it weighs 37 tons. 

So, counterintuitively it has effectively the protection of light armored AFVs yet it has the logistics impact of any other tank if not worse. The only real advantage here is that you have a lot of T-62s. They exist. And presumably enough are serviceable to make it somewhat worthwhile. What you don't have is anything better. Otherwise you wouldn't be using T-62s, you would be using the better stuff. 

I think this is holding out because today I saw images of obsolete, but contemporary to the T-62M models we've seen, versions of T-72 also arriving in Melitopol. They are starting to scrape the barrel and are using stuff that wasn't even in their starting lineup at the end of the cold war 30 years ago.",a62d9f269cc33ff3e75eca0259714488ef23a798,True,False,,,,,0,1654118541,,0,{},iau3dh9,False,t3_v2fb90,False,True,t1_iatxml7,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v2fb90/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_01_2022/iau3dh9/,1654118555,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654089741.0,[],text,t2_6gopw,False,False,

Yep. Not only did they only consider phase 1 but they basically ignored everything outside of Kyiv or anything that wasn't negative. And still they got parts of that wrong too.

The Russians weren't doing ""rapid armoured thrust towards crucial objectives""? Then why did we see large numbers of mechanized BTGs bypassing resistance trying to bumrush inland cities acting as strategic targets, which many were accurately describing as Thunder Run strategy? 

Or this gem:

""When this dash for the capital failed, there was seemingly no readily executable backup plan, despite Kyiv apparently being seen as the centre of gravity. Instead, the invasion proceeded concentrically on several disparate axes, without a clear focus of effort.""

If that was true then a map of the invasion on Day 1-2 would show a single axis of ""light forces"" into Ukraine heading towards Hostomel, before other axes opened up. But that's not what we saw, [this is](https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/UkraineCoTFeb24%2C2022.png). 

And what that map shows is six district strategic axes: Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donbas, Land Bridge, Kherson Dam, and Kherson-Mykolaiv-Odessa, with each broken up into numerous operational axes and then so many tactical axes that nearly every road heading inland had Russian mechanized units driving on it. And all of that was done simultaneously, concurrently, as in the broadest of broad front strategies. 

Their issue wasn't that they didn't do rapid armored thrusts towards crucial objectives, it's they did too many against too many conflicting objectives, which made coordination, command and control, logistics, tactical air support, etc all way harder, violating the principals of war of massing and economy of force. 

Plus, they only mentioned Mariupol to compare it to Grozny and Aleppo to drive home more negatives. While Mariupol was a bloodbath the Russians didn't seem to perform that badly clearing it, especially when considering that urban warfare isn't something they train on. The only issue was politically they got suckered into clearing it despite the heavier than expected resistance, but that's about Putin and not RAF.

The inertial initial invasion of this war was a disaster not due so much to systemic issues but mostly because nobody took it seriously. That's evident that they're performing better now, which isn't that they learned it's that they unfucked their lackadaisical attitude and started doing things the way they're supposed to based on training and doctrine. I wonder what the invasion would have looked like had they done that from the beginning but we can never know. And there is no point trying to reform to fix that, that was a mix of Group Think, intelligence failure, and apathy from Putin down to the lowest sergeant. 

They need to look at what's happening after that, and in all honesty it's not that bad especially since they're not fighting Ukraine, they're fighting NATO through Ukrainians, which completely changes the equation. That even gives them further reason not to take Ukraine lessons seriously because this war is so unique. The largest proxy war the West has ever supported, while Russia treats it not even as a limited war, legally it's not a war to them. 

When it comes to the Russian officer corps, they definitely can improve but in all honesty I don't think a major reform dedicated improving their competence is a concern.  The largest systemic issue for the RuAF is not something they might even want to attempt to tackle. Every career officer is a Yes Man but some countries are worse than others, and the Russian Armed Forces system pushes centralized decision making far more heavily then others. If they want better officers it's not just education it's implementation of a system that allows for maximum initiative so smart individuals are allowed to be smart. Which means a complete revamp of their military system from top to bottom as well as a total rewrite of all doctrine. That doesn't seem realistic, especially since the current conflict didn't actually prove the old one was flawed, because they didn't even follow their doctrine during the bloody and disastrous first phase.

They also can't do anything about corruption with Putin running things. That's a big one that will forever hinder them.

Their conscription system needs another major reform, this war might trigger it. The hybrid model is an organizational disaster. 12 months for conscripts is just too short, and their biannual intake causes major unit turbulence as large numbers of many unit's junior enlisted are switched out every six months. They should either go back to only conscripts or just go only volunteers. Mixing is bullshit. Not being able to rely on 1/4-1/3 of total manpower in a war because it's not officially a war is bullshit.

So realists prefer to talk about geographic factors, number of nuclear warheads on each side, how long it would take for a rocket launched from Ukrainian territory to reach Moscow, balance of powers and so on.

Constructivists would talk about constructed reality of Russians and Russian leaders (why they see threat in NATO, why they call Ukrainians nazis, why they think UKR and RUS are the same people and so on), national myths, belief systems. Many people pay attention to this stuff, but they don't say that they practice ""constructivism"". Is it because of Mearsheimer? People watched his lecture, learned that he is a ""Realist"", have found that his views are close to their own, and started calling themselves ""realists""?

Countries formally subjected to those imperialist designs (like Ukraine) have become increasingly adamant in not falling into the same situation, to the point where they may take ""irrational"" stances like a refusal to negotiate over captured territory even if it incurs catastrophic costs on them. Great powers will have to navigate this landscape  and realist views of power are unlikely to be particularly persuasive to them.

&gt;As we're seeing now, nations outside of the ""west"" and Russia / China are either staying as aloof as possible, or are playing each sphere off each other in an attempt to maximize their own gains (see: Turkey). Which means that success in our foreign policy will require cooperation with like-minded nations that share our values, and cooperation with states who do not share US values when necessary.

That's not really a deviation from post WWII liberalism either, which theorized that political and economic integration will pull states into a global liberal order out of their own self interest and provide leverage that doesn't involve the use of military force to utilize. This aspect of the theory is probably going to come under the closest scrutiny in the coming years, since it didn't really push countries like Russia or China to become more liberal but has managed to provide tools to significantly punish Russia for its aggression and threatening of the liberal order. I think we'll eventually come to the conclusion those tools need to be used sooner rather than later, and ""stability"" can be its own drawback and shouldn't be used as an excuse for inaction.",7544aeae2948c1b438ce77d546d7e8bc5c7712b2,True,False,,,,,0,1654108720,,0,{},iatfpb8,False,t3_v2fb90,False,True,t1_iat6oc2,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v2fb90/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_01_2022/iatfpb8/,1654108735,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654079920.0,[],text,t2_ir5jw,False,False,

No, that's out of date now. Only by decades rather than centuries though, so it's an improvement. After the Soviet Union feel apart US foreign policy changed substantially, and you're living in the past using those examples.
 
&gt;There's a long history of coups in South America, sometimes dismantling even democratic governments. There is none now, because, like I said, no other great power infringes on American turf.   

Also decades out of date. The modern example, Venezuela, shows that we are less interested in that stuff now. Instead we tried a bit out economic coercion, tried to support an alternative candidate, and now are moving to the carrot side of soft power. We will keep cycling through soft power options until we find one that gets us what we want.

&gt;Seems like a naive way to look at things. China doesn't care and only distances itself because it would only attract economic sanctions. The idea that we are past wars and conflicts is end of history nonsense and couldn't be further away from the truth.

China isn't personally offended by Russia's actions. China is angry because they were making significant inroads with their door power protection, even in places like Europe, and now Russia scared all the democracies, m made authoritarians look scary again, and messed up China's hard work.

It's not that we are past wars and conflicts and everyone should disarm. It's that the world has moved on from the old ways of acquiring power. Aggressive military force used to be acceptable and normal, and it's been becoming less do over the course of the last century or so. Centuries ago the game was that you invaded a country, stole everything that wasn't nailed down, and went home. Then the game evolved. People realized it worked better if they conquered a colony, extracted resources from it, and sent those home. Now the game has evolved again, and people have realized that conquering the nation isn't necessary, you can get most of the benefits and few of the costs by just trading with them. Of course Russia didn't get the memo, which is why they're talking about annexing land and stealing grain and metal. Very primitive stuff. Very ineffective, which is why Russia isn't a significant world power anymore, and China is.

And again, why China is angry that Russia is making authoritarians look bad. China has been working hard for years on messaging that authoritarianism creates better coordination and organization by centralizing control, and they democracies are disorganized and less effective. That message was honestly working well, but it doesn't anymore now that Putin reminded the world how quickly authoritarians can screw everything up.",cedb1e779ca2b290ef52d8c74bb8fd334b4b7abf,True,False,,,,,0,1654108562,,0,{},iatfbkt,False,t3_v2fb90,False,True,t1_iatbhnw,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v2fb90/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_01_2022/iatfbkt/,1654108579,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654079762.0,[],text,t2_3mz6e,False,False,

The sphere of influence thing for example. People always say what if China built a military base in Mexico. You use the example of Russia and Cuba. What would happen if someone did this? Probably nothing, but it's unlikely we will ever know for sure. Why? Because of soft power. The USA has a lot of it, China has a healthy amount, and Russia apparently isn't familiar with the concept. You can see how that informs how each country handles these sorts of issues.

Russia handles countries near them aligning away from them by either invading them, which severely hurts Russia (see Ukraine) or by blustering and then seething importantly (see Finland and Sweden). Those are it's only options, because it has no soft power.

The USA handles countries nearby by wrapping them into trade relationships and cultivating mutually beneficial ties, so they have no reason to align away from the USA (see Mexico and Canada). If you were paying attention, you'd notice that we have even been trying to thaw relationships with Cuba over the last few years. We generally threaten consequences, but would we get into a shooting war over some issue like this? Impossible to say for sure, and we make the occasional statement to keep the door open because talk is cheap, but the odds are slim. The more likely reaction would be to work harder to convert them to our side with soft power.

China's the last example here. They have been putting a lot of work into soft power especially of the economic variety. It seems to have earned them a base in the Solomon Islands recently. Same sort of bluster from the US and Australia regarding that. Is it gonna be followed up by military action from either nation? Don't hold your breath.

Yet another interpretation of which versions of MLRS we are providing Ukraine.  This story cites satellite based targeting- which is a feature of later blocks.  Earlier designs were “command post” loaded with rage targeting with a local override feature.  If it is true that the targeting will be provided by “satellite” it must be NATO members.  Ukraine lacks this capability.  I sense the outlines of a compromise;  Ukraine got the newer models with individually addressable warheads, but had to give up targeting control.  A little like “I’ll hold the rifle and you pull the trigger”.

[],False,,evo_help93,,,,,,"Allow me to push back on this because I do think realist geopolitical theory still has a few key insights to offer with regards to this conflict (of course it has flaws and is horribly abused / overused, but isn't everything on Reddit?).

In *general* discourse around the war has devolved into a view that this war is a turning point in international affairs, world history, etc. Much of the rhetoric is now about how the war in Ukraine is a defining point for the international world order: we will either give liberalism a much needed shot of life, or the world will backslide into wars of conquest and autocracy. 

A more long view of history will perhaps reveal that this is... not entirely true. Rather than an insane deviation or departure into the broad unknown, this war appears to mark a reversion to the mean - a return to the pre-1990 status quo of great power competition. 

This is *not* to say that the interests of small nations do not matter, quite the contrary. If Ukraine manages to survive it will be because they managed to effectively marshal and employ military power (with a lot of outside help) to overcome Moscow. Putin will not suddenly wake up and say ""I shouldn't have violated the post-war norm on wars of conquest."" So Realism explains a fair bit here and highlights how more constructivist or liberal international theories are perhaps constrained or less relevant when our rivals gain hard power. I would actually argue that part of what allowed the post cold war status quo to emerge was the relative weakness of both Russia and China - they simply did not have the *power* to challenge the order. 

Realism also helps guide our potential policy direction because it's been a particularly powerful tool to understand interactions between great powers during multipolar eras of competition. It's unlikely that the world is going to revert back to a unipolar world of American dominance (or a unipolar world of autocratic Chinese / Russian dominance). We'll likely see two spheres of influence emerge while smaller nations either choose between them *or* cooperate and compete based on their own rational self interests!

As we're seeing now, nations outside of the ""west"" and Russia / China are either staying as aloof as possible, or are playing each sphere off each other in an attempt to maximize their own gains (see: Turkey). Which means that success in our foreign policy will *require* cooperation with like-minded nations that share our values, *and* cooperation with states who do not share US values when necessary. Current American foreign policy has great difficulty doing this. Trying to position foreign policy as a battle between autocracy and democracy is almost inevitably going to fail (particularly in South East Asia where many of our partner countries have *pretttty* funky looking democracies cough cough the the Philippines). 

Anyway this post is getting long, but I thought I would just explain some of the reasons why realism maybe should be incorporated into our views, particularly as the competition with China heats up.",52f44fc1764b93969131c44b6c9283048a5c4419,True,False,,,,,0,1654104938,,0,{},iat6oc2,False,t3_v2fb90,False,True,t1_iasrqru,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v2fb90/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_01_2022/iat6oc2/,1654104953,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654076138.0,[],text,t2_iul8dbh4,False,False,

He's putting this on the wrong side of the ledger. He's trying to create a convenient narrative where the Russians are just stupid and incompetent. They are just too dumb to use their tanks right, we would have done so much better. 

In reality, Ukraine has been using NLAWs, Javelins, drones, and drone guided artillery to obliterate Russian supplies, keeping them from reaching their tanks, and causing the tanks to be lost. He has the belief that if a tank isn't literally hit by a Javelin, then the Javelin didn't get the kill, but if the Javelin hit the tanks fuel supply which ultimately caused the tank to be abandoned... the Javelin did indeed get the kill. If a switchblade 300 attacked a truck that carried supplies necessary to keep the tank operational, then the switchblade 300 got that kill. 

Its not that the Russians are incompetent, its that all this new tech has put intense pressure on Russian supply lines, which as resulted in a mass abandonment of military equipment. It is just bad superficial analysis to look at this and say ""Russians bad LMAO they left their tanks what morons"" and then claim that drones and MANPATs aren't having a significant effect on the war. 

Its so easy to look at Russia's troubles in Ukraine and go ""LMAO Russia sucks, drones mean nothing, should've learned combined arms"", and its so ignorant to do so.

&gt; How do you protect tanks from modern ATGM teams? You push UAVs and ground reconnaissance ahead of tank units and deploy sufficient infantry to protect tanks, particularly in urban areas. Russia didn't do this in the beginning, and tank units suffered as a result. 

This is dramatically more difficult to do in an age of long range MANPATs. if the range on your ATGM system is 500 meters, this isn't that hard. When its 2km it is an order of magnitude more difficult (remember that the area from which someone could fire an ATGM at you increases with the square of the range of the ATGM). The idea that you're going to clear 12km^2 surrounding the tank everywhere you go is unrealistic. With a switchblade, its not just unrealistic, its impossible. The area is far to vast.

The posts on the war are from before may 18th.

""There is another tragic issue to be noted. A lot of volunteer guys fled through the forests and plantings after these crazy attacks by our unit ... They fled because they were immediately thrown into battle and they didn’t even really know each other ... They said that they now roam the forests and plantings there in small groups not letting anyone close to them ... They shout to them - “Their own, their own !!!”, but they still shoot ... What was it like for these people? Cold, hungry to walk through this forest, plantations, constantly afraid to fall into the hands of these Ukrainian non-humans ... Who will be responsible for this?

  
At the beginning of May, I learned that one of our PMCs has the task of gathering such of ours through the forests and plantings in that area ... (Well, this is probably an accompanying task for them; besides this, I think they have the main task of fighting Ukrainian DRG) They picked up two of ours in one of the landings near Suligovka .... They fed us, gave us a new uniform, since our uniform was completely worn out during the two weeks of our stay in Suligovka and brought to Izyum.  


  
Another moment is this. In early May, two FSB officers came to visit us. Major and Lieutenant. As I believe, they are from the FSB department for the armed forces. I don’t know if they were divisions with this one or not. They were very polite. They tried very politely to return us to the front line. I said that we are just being thrown to a senseless slaughter, in fact. The lieutenant said they knew all about it. I said that not only did we refuse to storm Dolgenkoe - the special forces also refused to go on repeated assaults on this village. He said to this that, - ""we are aware, we are also working with them."" He said that - ""we do not condemn any of you (who refused)."" He said this several times. Then, on May 6th, a FSB colonel came. One guy said that he heard him say that he knew that we were ""like throwing meat at 20 people in an attack."" I'm just here In connection with all this, I don’t understand one thing - since the FSB knows this, why are no measures taken to eradicate this horror!? Or is that considered normal? Or is it just that, as we often do in Russia, everyone covers for each other, since all friends, comrades, relatives, drinking buddies, sovors!? For example, the daughter of this FSB colonel may be married (or in a relationship) with the son of the commander of my former division. So the case is not given a move ... It's all sad, of course ....""""",d8f4df46ea8283fb68841f295d6fb8ecbf83fe29,True,False,,,,,0,1654102631,,0,{},iat14i1,False,t3_v2fb90,False,True,t1_ias6ho8,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v2fb90/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_01_2022/iat14i1/,1654102645,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654073831.0,[],text,t2_8m7zk7na,False,False,

No.

&gt;The article is complete crap.

No.

&gt;We do have good examples of how the US would perform in an offensive operation in a non-peer conflict, Iraq.

Which was thirty years ago with a completely different Army that was focused on large scale combat operations. And it was prefaced by an air campaign over a month long that severely degraded Iraq's combat and logistics capabilities. Even still, had the ground campaign gone according to Schwarzkopf's original battle plan it likely would have gone worse. But intervention by Cheney to force the Left Hook strategy prevented that.

Unless you mean the 2003 invasion, where the Coalition faced an Iraqi military that remained completely shattered since 1991. 

Even still, the US has had major missteps in those and other conflicts that could have become outright disasters had their adversary exploited them. The Army had thirty Apaches damaged and one shot down over Karbala when they flew over a flack trap. Had Iraq been armed like Ukraine is, the Army could have lost a dozen or more choppers in mere minutes. Or the Battle of Kamdesh, where the Army build COP Keating at the bottom of a valley surrounded on three sides by mountains. That battle, where they were assaulted from above, wounded 27 soldiers and killed eight.

Or how about the Camp Bastion Raid, where fifteen Taliban fighters destroyed eight Harriers and a C-130 and killed two Marines? 

Or the 1999 shoot down of a F-117, where planners sent F-117s repeatedly down the same attack route, which was picked up by Yugoslavian air defense, resulting in the loss of a valuable strategic asset?

These incidents all happened in part due to a common cause: hubris. Which is exactly what this article is warning against.

But I guess the redditors who view this conflict through an incredibly filtered lens know better.

And evidently the US Army doesn't agree with you, as they are in the middle of a massive reconfiguration of their force structure that effectively dumps the Brigade Combat Team in favor of a division-centric concept precisely aimed towards large scale conflict.",fcd02d8a4571557d41eeb4d362c23707090ee006,True,False,,,,,0,1654102075,,0,{},iaszseb,False,t3_v1tu0r,False,False,t1_iasnxuj,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v1tu0r/would_we_do_better_hubris_and_validation_in/iaszseb/,1654102095,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654073275.0,[],text,t2_7u1jf,False,False,

These theoretical frameworks were never meant to explain every facet of a nations foreign policy. They're meant to explain the actions of nations and international affairs beyond the language of ""x action is bad"" or ""Ukraine *should* do x"" as these are value judgments that often are difficult to effectively explain to others without relying on some kind of shared framework (as a side note, I often say ""if you think everyone who disagrees with you is either *evil* or *ignorant* chances are very high you don't have a good understanding of the issue."").

My core problems with it is it postures as view free from idealistic assumptions when it makes claims that have a questionable relationship with reality and it does not even explore how its own reasoning can lead to multiple conclusions. 

Major problems about realist commentary when it comes to this conflict include but are not limited to: 

- Lack of consideration of how the weak response of Europe/US to Russia seizing Crimea may have affected the current situation.  

- Talk about NATO being politically vacuous. With war a part of politics its not enough to talk about NATO in some abstract sense. You need to talk about the foreign policy of the members in NATO towards Russia and vice versa. Once you do that brings up more questions as there were plenty of politicians that pro Russian (or at least not hostile to Russia), one of the reasons projects to increase economic independence with Russia were seen as a good thing was because they were thought to reduce the chance of war, and the ability of many members in NATO to wage war was questionable. NATO was such a major security threat Russia could said to be provoked but the foreign policy of the members of NATO doesn't reflect that?

- Generally only being interested in the most cool headed and rational sounding explanations. Ideas like Russia may really think Ukraine is a fake country can not be considered because there is an implication that Russia may have attacked it regardless of what anybody else did. Certain actions Russia has taken seem strange like their forced dislocation of Ukraine civilians if they only sought to strike back at NATO in some way. 

- The pseudo rationalist angle going out the window at times like with talk of escalation. There is no consideration about the problems using chemical weapons or nukes may create for Russia in even the military sense. Putin is portrayed as so trigger happy one may wonder why didn't he just nuke Chechnya and save himself a lot of time during those wars.",aad704e9b19673faa43ce7b53b9a346547278ff5,True,False,,,,,0,1654098076,,0,{},iasq9z0,False,t3_v2fb90,False,True,t3_v2fb90,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v2fb90/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_01_2022/iasq9z0/,1654098092,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654069276.0,[],text,t2_2pf9pqav,False,False,

O'Brien makes it sound like it is impossible for armored forces to achieve strategic, operational and tactical surprise because of limitations that every military mind has been aware of since the First World War. It strikes me that the professor may not know all that much about land warfare, since his publications are mainly focused on naval matters.

The *Atlantic* had also previously published another [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/ukraine-russia-moskva-military-marine-corps/629930/?) by Elliot Ackerman arguing how drones and anti-ship missiles are revolutionary tools that are going to make ""legacy"" systems obsolete. Ackerman is former special forces and would not have needed to worry the proper employment of armor when he was still in uniform. He made a big deal out of the sinking of the *Moskva*, heralding it as a revolutionary sea-change in warfare. Shouldn't he be aware that guided anti-ship missiles have existed for decades? The use of such a system in combat should hardly be heralded as a ""revolutionary"" event, rather it should be looked at as a common event for striking naval targets.

Neither of these mediocre minds are appreciating the manner in which the Russians are wielding their military instrument. The Russian campaign plan was poorly conceptualized. I had thought that the Russians were going to steamroll the Ukrainians, but their plan of campaign has been ineptly executed. There have been no deep operational thrusts--say a northern thrust from Crimea and southern thrusts from Belgorod and Bryansk with the intention of seizing the Dnieper River line and cutting off Ukrainian forces in the east from their bases of supply. 

The greatest problem that the Russians have is over-reliance on the Battalion Tactical Group (BTG) and seeking to use these reinforced battalions in an operational capacity. They lack the strength for prolonged independent operations, and the Russians have elected to create too many of these groups. They are permanent units created during peacetime, and it is obvious that they have failed under battlefield conditions. The BTG would serve well during the prior phase of this conflict: a static, low-intensity conflict when it would be beneficial to have firepower spread out to maintain pressure along the whole line. However, if an attacker is seeking a quick victory in a mobile campaign, offensive force must be *concentrated*. This requires centering operational military doctrine around divisions and corps, not reinforced battalions. Only divisions and corps contain the combined-arms forces for achieving operational breakthroughs, along with the ability to reinforce its individual components from operational reserves.

[],False,,RevolutionaryPanic,,,,,,"Strelkov Igor Ivanovich, \[6/1/2022 12:45 AM\]  
Briefly about the situation at the front.  
Near Kharkov - the front stabilized at a shallow depth from and along the border of the Russian Federation. Positional fights.  
South of Izyum - no change.  
   
Krasny Liman - the operation is basically completed, the remnants of the defeated enemy units are leaving the eastern bank of the Seversky Donets, our troops are mopping up the adjacent forests. It can also be noted that it was not possible to force the river ""on the shoulders of the enemy"" and, probably, the front will stabilize for some time along this line, as well as upstream and downstream.  
Severodonetsk. The enemy, snarling, is gradually clearing the city due to the limited ability to support and supply the garrison over broken bridges, which are under continuous artillery and aviation attacks of the RF Armed Forces. I believe that the cleansing of the industrial zone of the city will last another day or two, no more (unless, of course, the Armed Forces of Ukraine do not throw some other large military unit there for slaughter).  
District Lisichansk-Zolotoe. Fierce battles with a very slow advance of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and the Armed Forces of the LDNR (plus PMCs). The enemy continues to stubbornly defend himself in the ""bag"", counting on his unblocking. Apparently, the Armed Forces of Ukraine, having brought reserves into battle, managed to ""clear"" the Artemovsk-Lysichansk highway, pushing our advanced units, however, the road is under continuous shelling and it is difficult to supply the enemy group along it. It can be stated with a high degree of certainty that the outcome and timing of the completion of the operation to liberate Lisichansk depend precisely on whether the Russian troops will be able to cut the supply lines. In any case, this is extremely necessary, since the advancing units themselves are in a ""pocket"" with a not too wide neck, and until Zolotoe is taken, the threat to their flanks and rear will remain.  
There are no significant changes along the Artemovsk-Soledar line, local battles are going on, a new front line is being formed.  
In the area of ​​Avdiivka - no significant changes, fighting to improve positions, fierce artillery skirmishes.  
The area of ​​Marinka and to the south - to Ugledar without significant changes, positional battles.  
Zaporozhye Front - no change.  
Kherson Front - I believe that the attacks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the area of ​​\\u200b\\u200bDavydov Brod were quite large-scale, but still only ""reconnaissance in force"". The Armed Forces of Ukraine suffered significant losses in the attacks, but the amount of manpower and equipment brought into battle does not allow us to speak of a ""disruption of the offensive."" During the attacks, the enemy had some advance, but did not achieve a breakthrough of the front.  
Donetsk, Makiivka, Gorlovka - yesterday they were again under area fire from heavy artillery . And I do not rule out that in the coming days these attacks can become truly massive.  
General conclusions: the offensive of the Russian troops in the Donbass is in the process of fading and will not lead to the defeat of the enemy without the introduction of fresh large reserves. At present, the most acute issue for the Russian command is the occupation of Lisichansk, which will consolidate the successes achieved in the Popasnaya area by eliminating the dangerous ledge of the fortified area of ​​the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Lisichansk-Zolotoye area. The main efforts of our troops will probably be directed to the solution of this task in the next week, and I do not expect any new major operations until it is completed.  
The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and the Armed Forces of the LDNR are in dire need of combined-arms reserves to build on the successes being achieved. In this regard, the hostilities carried out in the saturated enemy troops and fortified positions in advance continue to be in the nature of ""gnawing through"" the defense, inevitably leading to heavy losses on both sides without major successes for the attacker.  
As of June 1, the AFU grouping in Donbas was NOT defeated, although it suffered serious losses and was forced to leave a number of important settlements (in a month: Popasnaya, Svetlodarsk, Krasny Liman, Severodonetsk) and in some places retreat to the second line of defense.  
Forecasts for 7-10 days:  
Russian troops will be forced to continue their attacks in the Lisichansk region, trying to break up or at least drive out the defending group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and occupy the city. New attempts to form the Seversky Donets are possible (I hope, if they are, they will not be as failed as all the previous ones). The Armed Forces of Ukraine will continue to defend in this area.  


In other sectors of the Donetsk Front, offensive battles will presumably be of a tactical nature, with the possible exception of the Avdiivka region, where a promising offensive (to the north) was suspended in favor of moving forces to the Severodonetsko-Lysichansk direction.  
Actions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The enemy will probably continue to ""grope for weaknesses"" in the defense of the RF Armed Forces in the Kherson and (possibly) Zaporizhzhia direction. At the same time, having sufficient ground forces for a limited offensive, the Armed Forces of Ukraine do not have serious air support and medium-range air defense capable of covering the battlefield from Russian aviation strikes beyond the first line of defense of our troops. Therefore, if intelligence detects the accumulation of enemy strike forces in a timely manner, it will undoubtedly be possible to stop his efforts. At the same time, the danger of a front breakthrough in the event of an unexpected strike should not be discounted. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are quickly learning how to fight and they are well led by foreign advisers.",144ea8cf73b8461fe70bb6ec2b1fd9699df09a7a,True,False,,,,,0,1654094948,,0,{},iasj3b8,False,t3_v2fb90,False,True,t3_v2fb90,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v2fb90/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_01_2022/iasj3b8/,1654094962,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654066148.0,[],text,t2_s4x5r4h,False,False,

Some key paragraphs:

&gt; When Russian oil company Gazprom Neft in 2016 launched its Arctic Gate terminal in the Gulf of Ob, it seemed beyond imagination that Russian oil only few years later would be barred from the EU. The new infrastructure built in the harshest Arctic climate had the capacity to deliver more than ten million tons of oil per year and was designed for exports to European consumers.

&gt; All projects and plans might now wreck.

&gt; The new sanctions will have devastating effects on the Russian oil industry, and especially operations dependent on shipments to EU terminals, like the oil from the Arctic. The Russian energy sector is from before hard hit by sanctions.

Putin's view of history is that Russia has been constantly attacked. Putin says they are fighting a defensive action here against neo-Nazism and to liberate Russians that are victims of genocide. NATO has been painted as constantly attacking Russia in some covert form or another with the end goal of invading Russia like Hitler did. Essentially you have a brainwashed Russian population that was enthusiastic about restoring historic lands in Crimea and Donbas, but was unprepared for the intensity of this conflict. The failure to move directly to full mobilization has made the military objectives largely untenable. Both the military and public were told to expect light resistance in Ukraine. Putin believed an air bridge secured by a few paratroopers could topple Kyiv. There is a stark difference between Russian expectations and reality here in this ""special military operation."" The modus operandi of the invasion was also poorly crafted. Troops were not in full kit because they were told they were on exercise. The bottled down roads only to then run out of fuel and abandon vehicles or to be picked off by artillery. The level of corruption in the military provided an ill prepared force. The lack of concentration on a single front did not allow for the massing of troops that was needed. The focus on urban fighting sacrificed a lot of heavy equipment. The entire operation failed as it began because the sanctions against Russia were too heavy of a price to pay long term. Authoritarianism within Russia has now grown stronger and the concern of a wider conflict is ever present. The Eastern Orthodox Church has split due to the invasion. Putin has sought to create a new cultural identity for Russia in the post Cold War era alongside restoring some level of the previous empires. Going into the conflict it was hard to say how both sides would perform. There are a lot of issues you don't discover until wars actually happen so prediction only goes so far. Obviously Russian invasion plans were poor. Ukraine could have mobilized faster. There are many issues you could examine in detail such as the poor Russian communications security or the poor performance of their air force. This level of attrition in this conflict is going to wear both sides thin as frozen fronts set in. A commodities crisis has been created on the world stage. Putin wanted a puppet regime in Ukraine without invading but never realized how untenable that was because of the misidentification of shifting sentiments there. The hybrid war approach would have sought to unseat Ukraine from within rather than relying on full out invasion. The first failure then was in terms of the special services which necessitates study.

[],False,,WildeWeasel,,,,,,"&gt;This swing in favor of smaller and cheaper defensive weapons has been matched in the air. The Russian air force, which was expected to dominate, has been significantly disrupted by Ukraine’s use of a range of cheaper systems, again including a number of handhelds, among them Stinger missiles that have been in service for almost half a century. Such systems render Russian pilots incapable of carrying out patrols, restricting them to quick point-to-point missions. 

The first sentence is true moreso because of the Russian Air Force's incompetence than a paradigm shift in air combat. Not true for other militaries that train in difficult exercises against robust and dynamic enemy air defenses. There are multiple reasons that I think the Russian Air Force has been dismal:

1. Russia has been incapable of conducting Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD). They don't have units dedicated to it and clearly couldn't mission plan in the opening stages of the war. Their pilots might have flown a few training missions a year or conduct nominal SEAD in a scripted exercise which means they're not prepared to bring down a multi-layered IADS, even one as old as Ukraine's. For radar SAMs to be still active 3 months into the war and shooting down aircraft shows shows this. Of course, not all SAMs will be destroyed in a week and one can expect mobile SAMs to survive and be a thorn. However, for big systems like S-300s that have multiple vehicles and a large footprint to still be active, it shows Russia's incompetence.
2. MANPADS and ADA do not render pilots incapable of carrying out patrols. The easiest way to defeat MANPADS and ADA is to fly above them which is what most other militaries do. MANPADS have been around for almost 50 years. ADA has been around for as long as the airplane. They're not new threats. Russian air forces (fixed-wing here, not helos) fly low likely to avoid radar-guided SAM systems (due to SEAD failures) or because they're not using guided munitions.
3. They likely aren't flying as much due to a lack of integration with their own air defenses. Conducting a large, joint campaign is extremely difficult and the risk of fratricide is very high without deconfliction. If the Russians don't train to a joint engagement zone or have rules for deconflicting, then their own defenses will bring down Russian jets.
4. As to drones...the jury is still out and I think it's too early to tell. They've been used in spades by western forces in the war on terror and this war has shown how useful they can be against modern forces as did Nagorno/Karabakh. However, as they develop, so will countermeasures like GPS and SATCOM jamming that target datalinks. Additionally, are drones that good or are Russian air defenses that lax? We also don't know Ukraine's full drone losses.

While the armata is a disaster for various reasons, I would not at all be surprised to see the next generation of tanks try to use un-manned turrets.

Adding the ability for remote control is entirely within our capabilities right now, even though obviously that is situational. I could also see the development of “hybrid” capabilities where the tank is crewed by default, but in certain situations is used remote, or even allows for something like the crew to dismount and then control the tank by wire.

Even that last one despite being very limited in range has a significant advantage because there are many times in which a tank is still capable of fighting, but is abandoned anyway because some safety aspect has been compromised (a classic example is a penetration of the crew compartment).",ea2d2d40937c33f021111839101cad1fdaccfa4c,True,False,,,,,0,1654090704,,0,{},ias9sbz,False,t3_v20eql,False,True,t1_iarr2rt,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v20eql/war_will_never_be_this_bulky_again_russias/ias9sbz/,1654090721,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654061904.0,[],text,t2_m8kieh6u,False,False,

-----------------------

&gt; Together with analyst Jakob Gustafsson, Michael Jonsson has conducted the study, Espionage by Europeans 2010–2021, where they analyse openly known cases of infiltration or insider espionage. Of the 62 individuals involved, 42 were convicted of espionage during the studied period, something that Michael Jonsson himself describes as “the tip of an iceberg.”

&gt; “We have chosen to use open sources, mainly newspaper articles, and focus exclusively on cases that resulted in convictions in court, to avoid the discussion about whether this is really about espionage or not. It’s a complex subject. There is very little data and more basic research is needed. This is a narrow selection, but it still provides a relevant picture of the situation.”

&gt; * It is a rather unglamorous picture of the spy life that emerges in the study, and it is not about huge sums of money, either. A study from the US shows that not even the most well-paid spies earned more than a million dollars in total.

&gt; * “Given the enormous risk-taking it entails and the relatively limited remuneration in relation to the stakes, being a source is not a very good deal. Rather, it is a cynical exploitation of vulnerable individuals. 

&gt; * The study finds that most convicted spies are found in Northern Europe, particularly the Baltics. In this context, Sweden has a vulnerable geographical location. 

&gt; * “It’s not possible to say for certain, but the Swedish Security Service, SÄPO, estimates that a third of the staff at Russian embassies are usually intelligence officers. That would mean 10–15 people at the Russian embassy in Stockholm.”

I am curious what the military discipline policy has been on both sides so far.

The fuel consumption of the M1 has been overstated to meme levels. It isn't as bad as everyone says. As Nicholas Moran points out, an Abrams company has about the same fuel consumption as a Sherman company from WW2. Now the Abrams company is short one tank from the Sherman's but that's pretty impressive for tanks that weigh twice as much and are faster. A big part of the improvement comes from the APU which allows the Abrams to sit with systems running without running the main engine. Turbines are efficient at load but not so much at idle. So the APU fixes it's biggest weakness. Turbines also have the advantage of being true multifuel engines. Although the US Army has never had to do that operationally. 

This same multifuel benefit also applies to turbine powered T-80s. Except the problem wasn't that the Russians ran out of fuel just for the T-80s. They ran out of fuel for everything. That's why we saw T-72s, BMPs, BTRs and other vehicles abandoned as well. The problem was not that the T-80 is anymore a gas hog than anything else. It's that the Russians had poor fuel logistics. And indications are that this may have been exacerbated by troops stealing and selling fuel in Belarus before the invasion started. 


Every army has a ""massive logistical vulnerability"". That's why logistics are so important both in supporting your forces but also important targets for you to destroy. Every army struggles with this and it's usually the one that gets it most right that wins. The US military has more than once in recent time rapidly advanced over large stretches of territory without outrunning its logistics.

&gt; * In sum, the war suggests that the recruiting, equipping and training of forces in the past 10–15 years yielded neither the quantity nor the quality of forces the Russian Ministry of Defence had boasted of and many abroad believed existed.62 Mounting evidence suggests that systemic rot played a key role in this drama.

&gt; * During Russia’s well-financed military-reform process, under way since 2008, Russia touted an increasingly impressive image of Russia’s military. Ever larger exercises and presentations of various Wunderwaffen made Russia’s armed forces look better and bigger.64 This portrayal enabled Moscow to cast Russia as a great power to domestic audiences and thus gain legitimacy. It also served to deter, intimidate or coerce real and potential adversaries, allies and neutrals. As long as forces are used in those ways, the effect of the rot can be hidden and matters less. The decision of Russia’s political leadership actually to go to war exposed the full effects of systemic cheating on Russia’s armed forces.65 War is a brutal examiner that exacts the truth.

&gt; * The headline finding of these studies – that Russia could prevail against NATO in a short, sharp and geographically limited war – may still be valid, as the scenarios analysed were, at least on paper, less daunting than the occupation of all of Ukraine. But several of the assumptions underlying the studies nonetheless need to be revisited.

&gt; * …all three studies note that Russian ground forces are larger and heavier, with better protection and firepower, than NATO forces on its eastern flank. Likewise, they have stronger artillery, ground-based air defence and electronic-warfare units.71 Accordingly, they were assumed to be difficult to stop, confront head-on or even slow down.

&gt; * Russian artillery remains a significant threat…

&gt; * Overall, Russia’s performance so far in Ukraine suggests that the balance of power in Europe is less daunting for NATO than previously thought, and that comparatively minor investments in key weapons systems could further improve it. With a weakened Russian army, possible NATO membership for Finland and Sweden, and major increases in European NATO defence budgets – particularly Germany’s – European powers may not remain as dependent on US support as they have been historically, although several critical gaps remain.
&gt; * A crucial conclusion is that fighting back has paid off for Ukraine in existential terms, and for NATO in providing critical insight into the state of Russia’s armed forces.

&gt; * Reconstituting Russian military power will be costly, timeconsuming and technically challenging.73 While the Russian military did notably worse than Western observers expected, however, this should not be considered a strictly reliable guide to future assessments. For instance, when Russia invaded, the Kremlin had kept its intentions secret even from large portions of its military, severely inhibiting preparations.74 Russia probably would not repeat this mistake in future conflicts. Furthermore, while military organisations are often conservative, losing a war or performing embarrassingly badly can spur dramatic change. Adolf Hitler famously discounted the fighting abilities of the Red Army after its poor showing in the Winter War against Finland, but learned otherwise on the Eastern Front.

&gt; * Perhaps the main priority of Russia’s armed forces has not been to be able to fight a large-scale war, but to underpin Russia’s claim to being a great power, and to facilitate the coercion of weaker neighbours, at times through smaller wars.

&gt; * In any case, the main threat from Russia is not its conventional capabilities per se, but its brutality, appetite for risk and nuclear weapons. 

&gt; * Finally, how well Western forces would perform if similarly challenged remains to be seen. Some of the flaws exposed within the Russian Armed Forces may well lie dormant within Western military forces too. Several reports indicate that European forces are hollow in several respects, such as personnel strength, equipment, supplies and training.

ABSTRACT

Russian armed forces’ lacklustre performance in Ukraine has surprised military analysts. Shortcomings have included breakdowns in logistics, poor equipment and morale, abysmal communications, and muddled command and control, as well as a weak showing by the Russian Aerospace Forces, air defence, and cruise and ballistic missiles. Chief among the contributing factors are wishful political thinking, overreliance on esoteric doctrine and endemic corruption. War, however, brutally exposes peacetime cheating. Consequently, estimates of Russian military capabilities – in particular, for large-formation combined-arms operations, logistics, air defence and intangibles such as morale – need to be carefully reassessed. Earlier analyses of a Russia–NATO conflict appear to have overstated the challenge of defending Europe. Looking ahead, the conventional threat from Russia seems less daunting than previously thought, and the country faces a formidable task in repairing depleted capabilities. That said, President Vladimir Putin’s appetite for risk is greater than anticipated.

—————————

Quotes:

&gt; * A rethink of Russian military capability is clearly warranted, both to adjust for its demonstrable shortcomings and weaknesses and, equally important, to understand their causes and long-term strategic implications.

&gt; * Conducted in the fog of war, with biased sources and against a moving target – as Russian forces are continuously adapting – this is obviously a first assessment, not the final word. Military capability is context-specific, so the fierce Ukrainian resistance, extensive Western support (especially in the area of intelligence) and poor Russian strategic-level planning need to be factored in to avoid following an apparent overestimation with an equally gross underestimation.

&gt; * The underwhelming performance of the Russian Armed Forces so far in the war in Ukraine has been evident at all levels of warfare, from the strategic down to unit level.

&gt; * Furthermore, this high-risk gamble was not preceded, as originally expected, by a massive shock-and-awe strike using the new long-range precision missiles Russia has touted, paralysing cyber attacks, debilitating use of electronic warfare or fiendishly clever psychological operations casting doubt on who started the war or on the utility of resistance.

&gt; * As for attempts to place the blame for the war on the victim, or at least to sow doubt in the minds of bystanders, a traditional Russian method, these may have been prepared, but they were stymied by the release of US and UK intelligence revealing the existence of such plans.11 This appeared to take hold in Western public opinion, contributing to the cohesiveness and forcefulness of the response, but had less traction in other parts the world, crucially including Russia itself.

&gt; * At the tactical level, the Russian army did not appear to fight as it trained in the annual strategic exercises shown off to foreign observers and the media. The use of mechanised and combined-arms warfare in large formations was widely considered a strong point of the Russian ground forces, especially as compared to Western armies that have focused on counterinsurgency for 20 years. 

&gt; * Since Russia is unable to staff more than a handful of its manoeuvre formations with 100% contract personnel, it effectively had to choose among deploying BTGs independently; deploying under-strength regiments and brigades with one or two BTGs each under command; or backfilling front-line units to full paper strength by adding BTGs generated from formations elsewhere in Russia. 

&gt; * It is more puzzling that the Russian military failed to effectively use larger formation headquarters to control and coordinate BTGs. While it is possible that the BTGs in Ukraine are independently reporting to Combined Arms Army headquarters directly, officer casualties indicate the presence of regimental, brigade and divisional headquarters in the field. This suggests that Russia has tried to employ intermediate-formation headquarters to control multiple BTGs below army level, but without obvious success. Their battlefield failure is probably attributable to staffing and quality issues in both the BTG headquarters themselves and the higher-formation headquarters.

&gt; * Small-unit leaders have not been able to break with the Soviet tradition of passively waiting for orders, which discourages initiative and punishes mistakes.

&gt; * Finally, before the war, many Western analysts were impressed by the modern gear that Russia exhibited, ranging from soldiers’ kits and close-in protection systems for tanks, to electronic-warfare and air-defence systems, to long-range precision-strike and hypersonic missiles.24 However, many of these capabilities have failed to materialise, or failed to impress when they did. 

&gt; * The second explanation is that Russia’s military leadership had overdosed on ideas of next-generation warfare, whereby subversion and psychological operations in combination with long-range precision strikes would weaken the enemy so that little conventional force would be needed. Western alarm about ‘Russian hybrid warfare’ after the successful annexation of Crimea in 2014 plus the fielding of long-range precision weapons may have made Russian military leaders overconfident. The General Staff might therefore have overestimated the efficacy of the tools at its disposal, aggravating poor judgement in the Kremlin.31

&gt; * The third possible reason is that the rot in the Russian Armed Forces revealed by the Russo-Georgian War in 2008 was never removed, but simply painted over.

&gt; * Of course, if Putin and his coterie of advisers had possessed a clear understanding of the ongoing extent of the problems within the military, the expectation of success in Ukraine would be even more perplexing. It may be more plausible to suggest that the Potemkin village was as much, or more, the product of self-deception as it was of deliberate policy.

&gt; * Planning was mainly done not by the General Staff but by the FSB, based on flawed intelligence fed to the Kremlin by intelligence officers eager to please.

&gt; * A sign of Putin’s anger with setbacks were the purges in the FSB Fifth Directorate, which was responsible for Russia’s pre-war assessments of and undercover preparations in Ukraine.

&gt; * Political meddling cannot, of course, explain every shortcoming of the Russian Armed Forces. Western notions of a ‘Gerasimov Doctrine’ of ‘hybrid warfare’ have been resoundingly debunked.

&gt; * For individuals, opportunities to abuse power, cheat or line their own pockets is a perk, and it is easy for them to assume that the resulting deficiencies will never be exposed by war. They are able to hide the rot and make the force look good on paper. Subordinates send rosy situation reports and padded personnel rosters to superiors, which creates a false picture and undermines decision-making. The fact that deficiencies are hidden makes it hard for external observers to identify and gauge the effects of corruption, and Russia’s authoritarian political system compounds the dysfunction. Furthermore, negligence, corruption’s cousin, affects equipment maintenance, among other things. This is an essential task in any military force. Here too, there are enough cases of equipment breaking down due to poor maintenance to indicate that in the Russian Armed Forces the problem is structural.50

&gt; * War itself, of course, readily reveals cheating. For instance, where have all the soldiers gone? Russia appears to have fewer trained, combat-ready soldiers than most observers thought before the war.

&gt; * The actual total number of Russian forces in theatre prior to the invasion was less than 150,000, and some of that total included administrative and conscript personnel assigned to peacetime garrisons in Crimea and Russian oblasts neighbouring Ukraine, and who were not used for combat operations.

&gt; * In addition, tactical-level underperformance of Russian units suggests structural problems.

&gt; * Many commentators have noted the half-hearted performance of Russian naval and air forces, including coordination with ground forces.60 War-crimes accusations against Russian soldiers for murder, rape and looting indicate either a breakdown of unit-level command or, far worse, soldiers just carrying out criminal orders. Putin’s statements about the non-existence of the Ukrainian nation, in combination with state media and others framing the war in genocidal, civilisational and apocalyptic terms, suggest that the brutality was intentional.61 If so, this reopens a dark chapter in European history thought to have been closed in 1945.",443f0c14fd14b3286cc5f52590554e44f310bb3d,True,False,,,,,0,1654085359,,0,{},iarzue6,True,t3_v2fh7f,False,True,t3_v2fh7f,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v2fh7f/a_brutal_examination_russian_military_capability/iarzue6/,1654085374,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654056559.0,[],text,t2_4lu6l,False,False,

[President Biden: What America Will and Will Not Do in Ukraine](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/opinion/biden-ukraine-strategy.html)

&gt;The invasion Vladimir Putin thought would last days is now in its fourth month. The Ukrainian people surprised Russia and inspired the world with their sacrifice, grit and battlefield success. The free world and many other nations, led by the United States, rallied to Ukraine’s side with unprecedented military, humanitarian and financial support.

&gt;As the war goes on, I want to be clear about the aims of the United States in these efforts.

&gt;America’s goal is straightforward: We want to see a democratic, independent, sovereign and prosperous Ukraine with the means to deter and defend itself against further aggression.

&gt;As President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has said, ultimately this war “will only definitively end through diplomacy.” Every negotiation reflects the facts on the ground. We have moved quickly to send Ukraine a significant amount of weaponry and ammunition so it can fight on the battlefield and be in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table.

&gt;That’s why I’ve decided that **we will provide the Ukrainians with more advanced rocket systems** and munitions that will enable them to more precisely strike key targets on the battlefield in Ukraine.

&gt;We will continue cooperating with our allies and partners on Russian sanctions, the toughest ever imposed on a major economy. We will continue providing Ukraine with advanced weaponry, including Javelin anti-tank missiles, Stinger antiaircraft missiles, powerful artillery **and precision rocket systems**, radars, unmanned aerial vehicles, Mi-17 helicopters and ammunition. We will also send billions more in financial assistance, as authorized by Congress. We will work with our allies and partners to address the global food crisis that Russia’s aggression is worsening. And we will help our European allies and others reduce their dependence on Russian fossil fuels, and speed our transition to a clean energy future.

&gt;We will also continue reinforcing NATO’s eastern flank with forces and capabilities from the United States and other allies. And just recently, I welcomed Finland’s and Sweden’s applications to join NATO, a move that will strengthen overall U.S. and trans-Atlantic security by adding two democratic and highly capable military partners.

&gt;We do not seek a war between NATO and Russia. As much as I disagree with Mr. Putin, and find his actions an outrage, the United States will not try to bring about his ouster in Moscow. So long as the United States or our allies are not attacked, we will not be directly engaged in this conflict, either by sending American troops to fight in Ukraine or by attacking Russian forces. We are not encouraging or enabling Ukraine to strike beyond its borders. We do not want to prolong the war just to inflict pain on Russia.

&gt;My principle throughout this crisis has been “Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.” I will not pressure the Ukrainian government — in private or public — to make any territorial concessions. It would be wrong and contrary to well-settled principles to do so.

&gt;Ukraine’s talks with Russia are not stalled because Ukraine has turned its back on diplomacy. They are stalled because Russia continues to wage a war to take control of as much of Ukraine as it can. The United States will continue to work to strengthen Ukraine and support its efforts to achieve a negotiated end to the conflict.

&gt;Unprovoked aggression, the bombing of maternity hospitals and centers of culture, and the forced displacement of millions of people makes the war in Ukraine a profound moral issue. I met with Ukrainian refugees in Poland — women and children who were unsure what their lives would be, and whether the loved ones who stayed behind in Ukraine would be OK. No person of conscience could be unmoved by the devastation of these horrors.

&gt;Standing by Ukraine in its hour of need is not just the right thing to do. It is in our vital national interests to ensure a peaceful and stable Europe and to make it clear that might does not make right. If Russia does not pay a heavy price for its actions, it will send a message to other would-be aggressors that they too can seize territory and subjugate other countries. It will put the survival of other peaceful democracies at risk. And it could mark the end of the rules-based international order and open the door to aggression elsewhere, with catastrophic consequences the world over.

&gt;I know many people around the world are concerned about the use of nuclear weapons. We currently see no indication that Russia has intent to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, though Russia’s occasional rhetoric to rattle the nuclear saber is itself dangerous and extremely irresponsible. Let me be clear: Any use of nuclear weapons in this conflict on any scale would be completely unacceptable to us as well as the rest of the world and would entail severe consequences.

&gt;Americans will stay the course with the Ukrainian people because we understand that freedom is not free. That’s what we have always done whenever the enemies of freedom seek to bully and oppress innocent people, and it is what we are doing now. Vladimir Putin did not expect this degree of unity or the strength of our response. He was mistaken. If he expects that we will waver or fracture in the months to come, he is equally mistaken.",65241eb0f6ffa7f8cab7462c76ae1b4d99767d0d,True,False,,,,,0,1654085020,,0,{},iarzabm,False,t3_v2fb90,False,True,t3_v2fb90,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v2fb90/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_01_2022/iarzabm/,1654085032,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654056220.0,[],text,t2_l2ded,False,False,

The cancellation seems to have been because they couldn't get it light enough to fly on as many aircraft as they wanted, and because it wasn't well suited to defending against IEDs (which had suddenly become one of the biggest threats the Army was facing).

There's a similar argument that if an ATGM can do as well as a heavy cannon against armor, then maybe the fire support role would be better served by a lighter, faster firing cannon. You could read support for that into the Army's decision to abandon the [Mobile Gun System Stryker variant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Combat_Systems_Manned_Ground_Vehicles) in favor of 30 mm autocannon- and Javelin-armed variants.

&gt; beyond the obvious damage that was being caused by NATO’s air attacks and the equally obvious fact that NATO could have continued bombing both indefinitely and with virtual impunity

And the full context of your own quote:

&gt; A bevy of criticism arose from some quarters after the bombing ended alleging that many of the 500 or more Yugoslav and Kosovar Albanian civilians who lost their lives to collateral damage incidents had died needlessly as a direct result of NATO attack aircraft having been kept above 15,000 ft in the interest of minimizing the likelihood of losing friendly lives. Critics further charged that operating at that altitude had somehow been risk-free, cowardly, and even immoral on the part of NATO’s aircrews.[93] In league with other detractors of the way the air war was conducted, strategist Edward Luttwak, for example, characterized 15,000 ft as a “not-optimal” but “ultra-safe” altitude from which allied pilots might carry out “perfectly safe bombing.”[94]
&gt;    In point of fact, 15,000–20,000 ft was precisely the “optimal” altitude block from which to conduct LGB attacks—not only to keep the attacking aircraft clear of short-range air defenses in the immediate target area but, more important, to give the LGB time to acquire the target and assume a stabilized glide. Contrary to the suggestions of critics, operating at medium altitude provides no protection whatever against radar-guided SAMs. It merely puts attacking aircraft outside the lethal envelope of “trash fire” threats (small arms, AAA, and infrared SAMs). These threats are impossible to detect in a timely way and offer little or no warning of imminent danger; as a result, they cannot be countered very effectively. Indeed, operating at medium altitude actually increases the risk of being engaged by unnegated enemy radar-guided SAMs because the aircraft can no longer take advantage of terrain-masking opportunities. The more important point, however, is that when medium-altitude attack tactics are employed, the timeline for target acquisition and weapons guidance is substantially longer, thus improving the chance of achieving a hit.

I heard it's something to do with oil. Or was it dates? Rugs? Nah, I'm pretty sure it was oil.

You do realize that same civilian leadership DID try to pivot to the Pacific in the late 2000s/early 2010s with their NSS and NDS update, right? 

No one can predict unstable leadership trying to start wars with Iran, right as their own NSS and NDS and civilian advisors were trying to get us out of the Middle East. Yes, we obey our civilian leadership - but since we can't handle every swinging whim, we have to plan for what's put in writing and plan contingencies elsewhere.

And guess what? You plan for the highest threat and hope we don't get dragged down by bad politics

&gt;Anyway, last I checked the military exists to do the bidding of the US govt and not pick their own missions. The missions the DOD as a whole and the Army in particular keeps getting assigned doing is one it sucks at and refuses to get better at, which in turn keeps embarrassing the US and making us look weaker. Instead it keeps focusing on the mission it wants, because then either because it things they'll be the heroes or more cynically it's the war that funds them the best that guarantees they don't have to even go to war. Because it's the war Army was never meant to fight as the main effort. Its importance as a supporting effort always ended once the ball dropped.

You do realize our National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy still gave a shit about nation-state actors right? And that since 2008, they've even prioritized them! And you do realize that counter insurgency operations were only one part of that right?

It's also the job of the military to request the budget to fulfill the needs of the NDS and to advise the President and our leadership to make the right acquisitions/research/manning decisions to fulfill said NDS.

They're not dragging their feet because they don't want to do the mission - they're making really fucking hard decisions on how to balance short-term goals and long-term goals, and sometimes the existential threats to the US matter more than those CENTCOM missions  - which, in case you haven't paid attention to, have gone about as well as you'd expect from a nation not willing to exert the force/manpower/resources nor duration to actually stick around for the generations required.

&gt;About as stupid as the Marine Corps' China plan, but oh wow does it pay good!

I'm not even sure what this tirade against Force Design has to do with anything aside from the fact you have a massive bone to pick at a time when the entire DoD is trying to refocus itself to its #1 priority, which has been underfunded for years because we've focused so heavily on an area that our own National Security Strategy tried to move away from a decade ago!

&gt;Are you referring to the T14? Or do you mean the new look reforms of the Russian Armed Forces that revitalized it into a fully modern professional military forces expertly using reconnaissance strike complex to win LSCO by retaking the Baltics? That is unless the intrepid and plucky heroes of EUCOM can stop them!

It's always been about China. The DoD hasn't prioritized Russia in at least a decade - the first sign anyone has no fucking idea what they are talking about with military affairs is when they mention Russia in the same vein as China

&gt;I didn't say it was only about funding, I mentioned numerous other reasons.

You're the one claiming near peer is a primarily made up term to justify funding for branches to focus on other areas - I'm saying the term started showing up when we started focusing on the rising #2 power in the world, which is exactly why they shfited focus

&gt;But it's no surprise that the Army shift to near peer focus, with the resultant cry for more funding and updated equipment, coincided near perfectly with the end of ""combat deployments"" to Afghanistan and after the Russian invasion of Crimea and the Donbas War starting, which formally rekindled Cold War into Cold War 2.0. It's almost as if they found a global crisis and exploited it perfectly to keep budget levels consistent with previous wartime funding during the GWOT.

I think the Army is a massive waste of money in the Pacific, but I still don't have a fucking clue what you are talking about with your rage-blinders on.

&gt;So now we're taking their propaganda at face value again?

I think one of the key problems with US foreign policy during the cold war was the nature of the ideological war we were fighting. The USSR was a authoritarian state, but it successfully presented a credible image as a temporary measure that would yield to a communist state rich with individual liberty and human rights. And what this meant was that when countries became less authoritarian and wanted to pick an ideology, we couldn't be sure whether they would side with us or the soviets. So in the interests of avoiding problems, we just made sure those countries didn't become more free in the first place. And that's a decision that caused a lot of suffering around the world and causes us credibility problems in the global south to this day.

But that's not really a risk with China. China doesn't export freedom and it doesn't really pretend to. China's message is that authoritarianism is good because the coordination it creates produces wealth for everybody, and it's better to be rich than free. Against China, I see less risk that we become worried about what free societies will do.

I'm also hopeful that we learned something from our mistakes after world war 2. That was the first time we were entrusted with that much power, and we have gotten an opportunity to see how propping up dictators causes us problems in the long run, where as democracies are much more enduring allies. I don't see any reason we can't learn anything from that.

We stopped suppressing freedom so actively after the USSR fell, though we are still propping up legacy dictators. Really the last 30 years has been the US genuinely trying to spread democracy, although also showing we don't really know how to do it in Iraq and Afghanistan. I still think we don't know how to create democracies.

The ""We"" who decide who and where to fight aren't the military, they're the civilian leadership of the US, and they are the ones who keep repeating the ""CENTCOM misadventures."" I heard it's something to do with oil. Or was it dates? Rugs? Nah, I'm pretty sure it was oil. 

Anyway, last I checked the military exists to do the bidding of the US govt and not pick their own missions. The missions the DOD as a whole and the Army in particular keeps getting assigned doing is one it sucks at and refuses to get better at, which in turn keeps embarrassing the US and making us look weaker. Instead it keeps focusing on the mission it wants, because then either because it things they'll be the heroes or more cynically it's the war that funds them the best that guarantees they don't have to even go to war. Because it's the war Army was never meant to fight as the main effort. Its importance as a supporting effort always ended once the ball dropped.

War against the Soviet Union was never going to won and lost by the US Army, that's the mission of the USAF and why the nuclear triad exists. But he US Army got it into it's head in the late 80s in particular that despite WW3 still planning on being a nuclear war that NATO might be fought it to a standstill without nukes. Modern army brass went full Tom Clancy with that theory as fact and decided that the handful of BCTs in Europe doing show of force A2AD deterrence operations, aka meat shields aka nuclear speed bumps, were actually there to save Europe and defeat the Russians without nukes being used, because yep, it's technically possible nobody threatens let alone orders nukes, so that's a chance worth basing an entire service wide mission on.

I didn't say it was only about funding, I mentioned numerous other reasons.

It's almost as if they found a global crisis and exploited it perfectly to keep budget levels consistent with previous wartime funding during the GWOT.

[],False,,Duncan-M,,,,,,"For everyone bringing up a lack of willpower, what about the Afghan Commandos? Anybody claiming they didn't have a will to fight is utterly full of shit. They were supposed to be the linchpin of the defense of Kabul and other areas. They were well equipped, highly motivated, well trained, and well led. Why did they fold?

Because we took away their air support without warning.

There is two aspects to that.

1.) The Afghans adopted the fucked up ISAF system for defending Afghanistan which ISAF couldn't even perform. It was losing before even handing the fight off to the Afghans. That meant dispered forces manning lots of middle of nowhere platoon and company sized combat outposts with larger battalion and brigade HQs located in provincial capitals and other key areas. Transportation was a mix of ground vehicles (mostly uparmored Humvee death traps) driving on shitty precarious roads for the most part that were easily ambushed and salted with IEDs. Or medium and heavy lift helicopters. 

The latter was far safer, faster, and more reliable means of transportation, and while the Afghan Air Force was doing it they weren't that good at it. More so  they were entirely reliant on an absolute shit ton of US defense contractors that hauled ass in May-June when the un-planned withdrawal was ordered. After that, and I'm not joking, they were trying to help the AF fix their fucking aircraft over mother fucking Zoom calls. Needless to say it didn't take long for nearly the whole fleet of aircraft, especially the helicopters, to be grounded. And guess what happens to troops stationed in bumfuck nowhere relying on helicopters for resupply, casualty evacuation, and tactical mobility permanently lose it while the Taliban launches a nation wide offensive? They fold like laundry.

2.) Especially when their other means of air support, actual fires. CAS was largely performed by the US. Not all, the AAF was busy but it was too small and not good enough to defend everywhere so the US had been picking up the slack. The Afghans were dispersed, remember? Following ISAF doctrine, remember? Utterly reliant on air strikes to play the cavalry to save the day, remember? Until the un-planned withdrawal was ordered. Then that was cut then the ANA collapsed then the Biden administration recalled the decision and air strikes were back on but at that point it was just to delay the takeover of Kabul. 

Why do I keep saying un-planned? Because it was utterly un-planned. We didn't have a plan for ourselves, which is why we didn't destroy stockpiles to ensure the Taliban didn't get it, or alert US expats or Afghan allies we had sworn to bring to US if the country fell. We didn't tell the Afghans or our NATO allies until we were already rushing out the country. Numerous Afghans military and politicians found out from watching the news. The decision was done by a dipshit POTUS against the advice of pretty much every single person in uniform (this isn't partisan, he isn't the only idiot POTUS, all his predecessors involved in Afghanistan fucked up hugely, his was just the last and worst). 

So in a totally unplanned move,  the Afghans lost access to air strikes in weeks and over the course of a month lost access to most aerial transportation all while a massive preplanned Taliban offensive started after the previous dipshit POTUS told them the Taliban they were going to win in a year and a half.  At that point the big offensive was planned and just waiting for news of the withdrawal to kick it off, and [it was a damn good one](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/how-the-taliban-did-it-inside-the-operational-art-of-its-military-victory/) (though with the number of years since they've known they'd eventually win, since December 2009, they had the time to create a good one).

So if you want to compare Afghanistan with Ukraine wait a few more years of war when Ukraine is 100% reliant on US aid and then cut it all without warning at the same time Russia launches a very competent full scale strategic offensive. I'd be very amazed if UA didn't fold either.

Is it? The process for artillery is something like: find your target, contact the artillery crew and give them the info, and then they fire at the target with a best-case accuracy of.. what, within ~5-10 meters of the target point? Assuming it's a round with some kind of laser/targeted input--otherwise they just have to put it in the general area and then spend another couple rounds actually dialing on-target. And also the artillery is probably at least ~10-20 miles away from the target, meaning once they finally fire at the target there's gonna be a delay of 30-60 seconds flight time depending on location of artillery and its target.

Hopefully the target hasn't moved too much, taken cover, and/or killed whoever was requesting artillery support while all that shit was going on.

Air support also requires a chain of communications and permission being granted before it can finally move in and do its thing--assuming it is, in fact, safe (enough) for it to move in and do its thing.

Meanwhile the tank is right there, at the front with the troops, and it takes 3-5 seconds for each shot. And it's gonna hit that target very quickly and very accurately, because its rounds are moving literally twice as fast as an artillery round and it's close enough to actually see what it's shooting at.",2bf93e11ebe8a8038d38355f9a887e42fc7127cc,True,False,,,,,0,1654056729,,0,{},iaqytsd,False,t3_v1omg9,False,True,t1_iaqx3xw,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v1omg9/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_31_2022/iaqytsd/,1654056742,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654027929.0,[],text,t2_hoiys,False,False,

It's tempting to look at the outcome as inevitable from hindsight, but I think that's a mistake.

The second mistake is that I think you're placing far, far too much importance on the US training of the Ukrainian forces. The fundamental reason the Ukrainians are winning this fight is because they have spent the last 8 years at war and preparing, and although western training and equipment is important, it's not like the US built the Ukrainian army from the ground up, like we tried to with the Afghani army. I remember reading an article where some of the special forces who went to Ukraine to train their army said that they learned as much or more from the Ukrainians as the Ukrainians learned from them.

There's a saying that losers tend to learn a lot more from wars than winners do, and that's kinda what happened here. Ukraine lost in 2014, and they have put a lot of effort into figuring out how to avoid that outcome. Russia obviously hasn't put much, if any effort in.

Kenneth Estes, author of “Marines Under Armor: The Marine Corps and the Armored Fighting Vehicle,” told Marine Corps Times that Marines whose first taste of combat was Vietnam deployments didn’t encounter the tank often so following the war didn’t see its potential as much as their World War II and Korean War forefathers had.

By Joseph R. Biden Jr.
Mr. Biden is president of the United States.

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/opinion/biden-ukraine-strategy.html

The invasion Vladimir Putin thought would last days is now in its fourth month. The Ukrainian people surprised Russia and inspired the world with their sacrifice, grit and battlefield success. The free world and many other nations, led by the United States, rallied to Ukraine’s side with unprecedented military, humanitarian and financial support.

As the war goes on, I want to be clear about the aims of the United States in these efforts.

America’s goal is straightforward: We want to see a democratic, independent, sovereign and prosperous Ukraine with the means to deter and defend itself against further aggression.

As President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has said, ultimately this war “will only definitively end through diplomacy.” Every negotiation reflects the facts on the ground. We have moved quickly to send Ukraine a significant amount of weaponry and ammunition so it can fight on the battlefield and be in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table.

That’s why I’ve decided that we will provide the Ukrainians with more advanced rocket systems and munitions that will enable them to more precisely strike key targets on the battlefield in Ukraine.

We will continue cooperating with our allies and partners on Russian sanctions, the toughest ever imposed on a major economy. We will continue providing Ukraine with advanced weaponry, including Javelin anti-tank missiles, Stinger antiaircraft missiles, powerful artillery and precision rocket systems, radars, unmanned aerial vehicles, Mi-17 helicopters and ammunition. We will also send billions more in financial assistance, as authorized by Congress. We will work with our allies and partners to address the global food crisis that Russia’s aggression is worsening. And we will help our European allies and others reduce their dependence on Russian fossil fuels, and speed our transition to a clean energy future.

We will also continue reinforcing NATO’s eastern flank with forces and capabilities from the United States and other allies. And just recently, I welcomed Finland’s and Sweden’s applications to join NATO, a move that will strengthen overall U.S. and trans-Atlantic security by adding two democratic and highly capable military partners.

We do not seek a war between NATO and Russia. As much as I disagree with Mr. Putin, and find his actions an outrage, the United States will not try to bring about his ouster in Moscow. So long as the United States or our allies are not attacked, we will not be directly engaged in this conflict, either by sending American troops to fight in Ukraine or by attacking Russian forces. We are not encouraging or enabling Ukraine to strike beyond its borders. We do not want to prolong the war just to inflict pain on Russia.

My principle throughout this crisis has been “Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.” I will not pressure the Ukrainian government — in private or public — to make any territorial concessions. It would be wrong and contrary to well-settled principles to do so.

Ukraine’s talks with Russia are not stalled because Ukraine has turned its back on diplomacy. They are stalled because Russia continues to wage a war to take control of as much of Ukraine as it can. The United States will continue to work to strengthen Ukraine and support its efforts to achieve a negotiated end to the conflict.

Unprovoked aggression, the bombing of maternity hospitals and centers of culture, and the forced displacement of millions of people makes the war in Ukraine a profound moral issue. I met with Ukrainian refugees in Poland — women and children who were unsure what their lives would be, and whether the loved ones who stayed behind in Ukraine would be OK. No person of conscience could be unmoved by the devastation of these horrors.

Standing by Ukraine in its hour of need is not just the right thing to do. It is in our vital national interests to ensure a peaceful and stable Europe and to make it clear that might does not make right. If Russia does not pay a heavy price for its actions, it will send a message to other would-be aggressors that they too can seize territory and subjugate other countries. It will put the survival of other peaceful democracies at risk. And it could mark the end of the rules-based international order and open the door to aggression elsewhere, with catastrophic consequences the world over.

I know many people around the world are concerned about the use of nuclear weapons. We currently see no indication that Russia has intent to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, though Russia’s occasional rhetoric to rattle the nuclear saber is itself dangerous and extremely irresponsible. Let me be clear: Any use of nuclear weapons in this conflict on any scale would be completely unacceptable to us as well as the rest of the world and would entail severe consequences.

Americans will stay the course with the Ukrainian people because we understand that freedom is not free. That’s what we have always done whenever the enemies of freedom seek to bully and oppress innocent people, and it is what we are doing now. Vladimir Putin did not expect this degree of unity or the strength of our response. He was mistaken. If he expects that we will waver or fracture in the months to come, he is equally mistaken.",acf3b34310891563bfc1119fa9e9d98ce2c04a56,True,False,,,,,0,1654047280,,0,{},iaqgly3,False,t3_v1omg9,False,True,t3_v1omg9,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v1omg9/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_31_2022/iaqgly3/,1654047292,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654018480.0,[],text,t2_4doeu,False,False,

Everything we have heard from media, granted it's likely biased, is that Russian morale on the battlefield is extremely low. Russian infantry were treated as expendable, and forced to at best purchase supplies and at worst steal and loot for food and drink. We hear stories of Russians sabotaging or outright abandoning equipment, and in one case even running over a commander. Many don't even know what they're fighting for, or were convinced they'd be hailed as liberators as they entered cities, or have friends/family in these cities, or are simply convinced by citizens' appeals to humanity since they share a language. It's easy to see why Russian soldiers would have incredibly low morale, and it's easy to see how massive an impact this has on the morale and discipline of an army. 

Meanwhile, the consensus among Ukrainians is that they are fighting for their very existence. ""The Ghost of Kyiv,"" the soldiers at Snake Island ""Russian warship go fuck yourself,"" and the unveiling of the horrors at Bucha are all propaganda (not saying they didn't happen, but that the media is exploiting them for this purpose) that incite Ukrainians to fight with everything they've got.

If any other country wants to do that, they don't have near enough PGMs. So they need to fly low in order to deliver unguided bombs and that exposes the attackers to manpads and AAA, which can't be easily destroyed while flying 6,000 meters above the ground, even if you have PGMs (which this non-USA belligerent doesn't have).

By flying that way, they'd take looses. In WW2, a country could loose 50 planes in a day and their factories were manufacturing 55 a day, so they still come out on top. Nowadays, that's impossible. If a country looses 15 fighters per day, they can't replace those looses.

My biggest contention though is I'm not sure where in the US doctrine does it call for a mass mechanized river crossing against an aware foe. To start with, what sort of conflict involves the US sending a massive amount of armor on an offensive operation that requires this sort of a river crossing? Massive tank rushes across the planes of Europe is really more of a Russian thing, while defending against the same is a pretty big element of everyone else around Russia.

In that respect I think the US would do better by simply not being in that sort of situation.

The author makes a point that the US is not very experienced in offensive combat, and that's entirely on point. The entire political and military organization of the NATO allies seems to be build around defensive combat. The only time I can reasonably see this sort of push is when chasing a retreating and broken opponent. Otherwise I would expect the US to use it's superior range and technology to make the enemy bleed over a longer range, and send in smaller teams to conduct ambushes. Basically exactly what Ukraine has been doing up to now at the unit leve. The biggest issue for Ukraine is that they don't have access to nearly the same degree of firepower that the US would have, so they are having to make do with only a small faction of the equipment and variety of systems that the US would be using in the same position.

This in turn raises another point. Offensive warfare on the modern battlefield is incredibly costly. Even with Russia's current slow push, if you believe the Ukrainians both sides are losing comparable numbers of troops, despite the fact that Ukraine is nowhere near as well equipped as a major western power would be. What would the casualty rate be if the Russians were facing a military that has already trained extensively using superior artillery, and has access to many thousands of suicide drones, backed by a bunch of flying, nearly invisible super-computers, all sharing data in real time. All the while individual special forces units would be getting behind enemy lines, and laying down accurate semi-automatic fire at night, at 800 meters.

In other words, I just don't see the US fighting a 20th century war given it's eagerness to adopt 21st century weapons and tactics.",81f0598ade1e5b731b1b2853212da81469414529,True,False,,,,,0,1654041602,,0,{},iaq4pef,False,t3_v1tu0r,False,True,t3_v1tu0r,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v1tu0r/would_we_do_better_hubris_and_validation_in/iaq4pef/,1654041614,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1654012802.0,[],text,t2_3yp3u,False,False,
