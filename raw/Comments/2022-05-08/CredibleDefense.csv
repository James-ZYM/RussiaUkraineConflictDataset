Appeasement has never succeeded in these types of conflicts and it will not be an option for the war based on their stated objectives. Failing to address a nuclear attack adjacent to NATO risks allowing the conflict to expand just as much as allowing it to occurred unchallenged. 

2. I don't think you understand how a civilian populace will respond to a huge decrease in their quality of life.  No one will stand around waiting for gruel in a bread-line, they'll revolt first.

3. China is highly dependant on trade, international stability, and relations with western partners.  They have already failed to support Russia's war, you think an escalation that hurts their own interests is going to be supported?

4. Ukrainian forces are within a few kilometers of Russian forces in many places. I want you to be specific about which location Russia could target that would significantly damage Ukrainian armed forces without damaging Russian armed forces AND would allow some type of tactical or strategic breakthrough. Not generalities, specifics. The LOC is the highest concentration of Ukrainian forces but is directly beside much of the DPR and LPR cities. Everywhere else Russian is already having trouble targeting specific Ukrainian forces with conventional weapons, now you want them to lob nuclear weapons around?  The Ukrainian forces are in static positions except in cities and maybe a few airports deep within Ukrainian territory.  

6. The war will NOT be, that is YOUR  hope. The army likely has no way to accurately project if it would succeed.  Further, it may escalate the war into nuclear Armageddon.  Both times in history where Russia was on the brink of launching nuclear weapons, officers refused to follow orders, do you think that will change?  Also, again, nuclear attacks will not necessarily end the war sooner.

7.  There are other asymmetrical options by Ukrainian units to respond nuclear weapons. They do not have to respond, in kind with a nuclear weapons themselves.

8. There are plenty of examples where resource based economies are less stable and successful than others. A truly diversified and globally integrated economy is what countries usually strive towards, not some resource export dependant economy. 

9. Exactly and it has negatively affected Russia, why would they want it to be even worse and potentially permanent. We know Russian is highly sensitive to sanctions and have sought their removal in negotiations. Why would they risk permanent leper status?

Short term consequences could include a mass popular revolt within Russia, desertion from the army, and a coup within the Russian command. There is no nuclear option.  Quit trying to present it as a possibility while tehy're losing in Ukraine.

Consider this: Russia is effectively fighting a war not against puny little Ukraine but against all NATO countries combined, where every country is trying to one-up the next one in how much support they will give. The amount of support that has already been given to Ukraine is unprecedented and extraordinary, and more is already on its way.

WTF are you talking about? Because VC could infiltrate into Hue and Saigon to hit the embassy in 'Tet 68 you think helicopters were useless? lol

&gt;They suffered heavy losses because they were used so much despite being so vulnerable.
 
Everything is vulnerable when the enemy has a vote and sets up well conceived and executed TTPs to counter your army' tactical transportation plans. Hence why AP and AT mines exist among other things. There is no means of maneuver that isnt extremely dangerous or limited because of terrain and distances. Vietnam was the perfect war for helicopter ops, which is why nearly every US infantry unit was organized as air mobile. 

&gt;They failed with the SCUDs, I'm skeptical those road/overwatch ops involved ""assaults"" or required helos, and I don't really consider those major missions.

First, I want to point out you weren't even aware the 101st conducted the largest air assault operation in history during this war. That's very pertinent to those following this exchange because one can't lecture on a subject that they don't know about.

Second, recon teams failing to find SCUDS had nothing to do with the means of infiltration, which allowed recon teams to conduct very deep insertions into enemy territory, despite contested airspace.

Third, they were part of a major secondary operation that helped keep Israel out of the war, which had strategic value.

Fourth, since recon teams seize and hold terrain (their hide site), it's still forceable entry, still air assault. 

&gt;However, budgets are zero-sum, so how ""useful"" something is should probably reflect its' tactical/deterrence-based cost/benefit ratio. 

Right. So an insertion technique proven extremely useful and valid in basically every type of war the US has fought since helicopters started being used isn't a good investment because you think they're a bad investment. So they're bad in comparison to what?

Key Takeaways

Russian forces are likely amassing in Belgorod to reinforce Russian efforts in northern Kharkiv to prevent the ongoing Ukrainian counteroffensive from pushing closer to the Ukraine-Russia border.

Russian forces near Izyum focused on regrouping, replenishing, and reconnoitering Ukrainian positions in order to continue advances to the southwest and southeast of Izyum.

Russian forces continued their ground attacks to drive to the borders of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts but did not make any territorial gains
Russian troops continued to assault the Azovstal Steel Plant and advanced efforts to economically integrate occupied Mariupol into the wider Russian economy.

Russian troops may be preparing for a renewed offensive on the Southern Axis but are unlikely to be successful in this endeavor.",15a7cd1b2cefa85863ca751a828709cd4b299db4,True,False,,,,,0,1652048872,,0,{},i7umxk0,False,t3_ul07ek,False,True,t3_ul07ek,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ul07ek/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_08_2022/i7umxk0/,1652048884,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652020072.0,

Benefits of nuking Ukraine: may force Ukraine to the diplomatic table and bring a close to the war. My personal opinion but I don't see how Russia can bring about a ""victory"" at this point. They are probably running low on equipment and morale is probably really low. Maybe they're able to hold onto their current gains but they're getting pushed back in some areas and this is before the western heavy weapons have arrived en masse. 

Consequences: Russia will be viewed as a pariah state. But they already are viewed that way. Russia is already isolated in many ways. Their nation may be headed backwards but Russia is a country that is rich in natural resources. They can sustain themselves with limited interactions with the rest of the world. The people inside Russia may be relieved that the conflict is over and that they ""won"".

Ukraine is definitely losing experienced and well trained troops, but being on the defensive in preset fortified positions--combined with better training than most of the Russians, plus a more modern combined-arms combat doctrine and NATO-style flexible decision making in the field--means they're almost certainly losing those guys at a much lower rate. We probably won't have any real idea until the end of the war, but I'd guess a decent chunk of Ukrainian casualties so far are the Territorial defense guys with less training/discipline. And the Ukrainian reinforcements are most likely also higher quality than the Russians--again, modern near-NATO training combined with high morale and better equipment.

The West has been sending more and more relatively-modern NATO equipment: M777s, ZpH 2000, even Excalibur rounds. The USA specifically is signing its Lend-Lease act tomorrow on the 9th, which will basically mean Ukraine gets what Ukraine wants--the details of payment can be hashed out in a year or two. Additionally, Europe is still consolidating and solidifying its position around Ukraine, increasing how much and what it's willing/capable of giving to them.

Time just doesn't seem to be on Russia's side, economically or militarily. Their position only continues to get worse, while Ukraine's improves so long as the West is willing to back them. Imagine if Ukraine starts rolling out F15s and M1A2s in 6 months? Russia *cannot* out-compete with a unified Europe, or the USA on its own, let alone both of them together. The only way I can see Russia winning is if Ukraine massively drops the ball somehow, or the West decides to pull out.",f4c09c4e25c6fa3eb2a21b9e52e54df92601163a,True,False,,,,,0,1652046112,,0,{},i7ugtw8,False,t3_ukrhnr,False,True,t1_i7ue74p,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ukrhnr/russias_manpower_conundrum_in_ukraine_russia_is/i7ugtw8/,1652046132,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652017312.0,

Current units are underperforming because they are undermanned due to losses and rotation, and that's after the fact that BTGs lack sufficient infantry to begin with. You need enough infantry to secure your rear and man the defensive sectors so you can concentrate your best troops for the attack. On top of that, major offensive against the type of defenses that Ukrainians have, require a large troop commitment that at current levels Russia doesn't possess.

Regarding morale, the morale in Russia seems ok, it's the morale of the troops is flagging, mostly due to losses and lack of success, which is due to the fact that the current units are too weak to be able to break through and are even insufficient to hold the entire frontline (as shown near Kharkiv)

Finally, Russia doesn't need a full mobilization. A partial mobilization may prove sufficient to balance out the increasing manpower advantage of Ukraine. However, the longer they go without it, the more troops they will need to mobilize when they they finally decide to and the bigger losses they'll have to take in the process.

In other words, assuming defeat is not acceptable to Putin, sooner or later he will have to mobilize because even a stalemate won't be achievable at the current manning levels in the next few months.",902ae879b9568d2392c1ee1bc96aacbd67bb48a0,True,False,,,,,0,1652040670,,0,{},i7u4ey1,False,t3_ukrhnr,False,True,t1_i7tx4ix,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ukrhnr/russias_manpower_conundrum_in_ukraine_russia_is/i7u4ey1/,1652040684,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652011870.0,

The contention is that while countries have mobilized before, they did not face shortages of critical raw materials. At least as far as advanced weaponry goes, there is some question to what degree Russia has ever had the capacity to produce it without Western components. Precision bombs and missiles or even just newish vehicles it is questionable if Russia can produce in quantity from what it has right now under sanction. It also has to do this while simultaneously meeting domestic needs for basic consumer goods across every industry.

Precision weapons might not be critical, but there is some potential that if they run out and Ukraine increasingly has them the technological advantage would allow Ukraine to simply knock out the numerical advantage Russia now enjoys. Having 10,000 howitzers might not be enough if every time they fire they and their crew are lost to counterbattery fire from just out of range. It might not be necessary to destroy every battery if people don't want to man them for fear of being obliterated.

Deferments and outright bribes kept more and more men out of uniform as the Soviet system entered its final years.

2. 40% Army, 14% Navy, 16% Aviation, 13% Strategic Deterrent Forces and 25% command. (Breakdown from 2008)

4. Somewhere around 80% of available combat forces has been used in Ukraine because they needed to hold some back for defense in other sectors 

Assuming the Russian Army operates under many of the same ratios as previously and they're using mostly soldiers rather than conscripts, that works out to:

900,000 X .5125 (Soldiers and 1/2 Officers) X 0.525 (Army and 1/2 Command) X 0.8 = 194K  

194K is pretty close to the number of troops Russia was alleged to have committed to the war. Russia sent some additional troops over 190K after the invasion, somewhere between 10 and 15K. That said, some of their initial 190K were actually DPR and LPR troops so the numbers match.

[],False,,VincentRAPH,,,[],,,,text,t2_hoiys,False,False,"&gt;Another point is that the Russian economy will not be able to handle it. Yes Russia will have to at least partially switch to a war economy. But there is no reason to think that Russia’s economy won’t bear the strain considering that in the past many countries have successfully mobilized and fought wars before.

Russia's economy is already not doing well. They've artificially done just about everything they can to prop it up and slather makeup on its shambling corpse, but it's still not doing well. Mobilizing a large chunk of its work-force probably won't help the situation much. I've seen some estimates that, assuming nothing gets better or worse for it, it probably can't sustain this war+current sanctions for more than a year--maybe two.

And the sanctions are getting worse as fast the western nations can get themselves into positions to stomach the pain.

&gt;As Koffman points out retaining conscripts with a stop loss and recalling recently served reservists will create a force that has combat training in its recent past. Then they can undergo additional training for a few months. 

As you point out, it's going to take months at a minimum for Russia to start churning out even half-reasonably trained reinforcements. Meanwhile Ukraine started doing the same back at the beginning of the war. Unless the fresh Russian troops are somehow significantly more competent and better equipped than the first waves (they won't be), I don't see how they'd make a major difference by the time they arrive.

&gt;Finally, if mobilization is not practical or useful, why has Ukraine already enacted multiple mobilization waves? Clearly Ukraine sees value in it as it continues to mobilize and I would go as far as to say that battle lines would have looked very different if Ukraine never mobilized.

It's not that mobilization is just inherently useless or impractical. It's that Russia specifically, in these circumstances, probably isn't going to improve its situation all that much with full mobilization.

Ukraine already has a nearly 3-month head-start on mobilization, its training is basically that of a modern NATO military, it has a steady (and nearly unlimited) flow of constantly improving equipment from the West alongside financial aid, medical supplies, food, fuel, intel, and more. Its troops, for the most part, have extremely high morale because they are fighting for their existence as a country, as a culture, and their right to life itself.

Meanwhile Russia is already using up the best stuff it has, and it isn't good enough. They have a limited supply of questionably maintained older equipment back in Russian storage. Its best troops have been fighting and dying since the start of the war. The morale seems questionable, both back home and on the battlefield.",d5e9a297d73b2518c934c9205be4e28e2116f835,True,False,,,,,0,1652037446,,0,{},i7tx4ix,False,t3_ukrhnr,False,True,t1_i7t4ipa,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ukrhnr/russias_manpower_conundrum_in_ukraine_russia_is/i7tx4ix/,1652037462,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1652008646.0,

&gt; * Indeed, if there is a front line in the emerging global standoff between democracy and autocracy, it lies at the borders of these younger democracies, where peoples and governments are changing their behavior in real ways and making tangible sacrifices to maintain their freedoms—from a peacetime surgeon in Taiwan preparing to deal with conflict, to countries adjoining Ukraine donating weapons to aid the fight against Russia.

&gt; * Whether Ukraine and Taiwan get the support they need to remain sovereign is likely to be a defining geopolitical question of this generation, extending beyond regional political dynamics. Countries in both Europe and Asia appear to see this clearly now—note how quickly the Biden administration enlisted Asian allies such as South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and even Singapore to sanction Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Their willingness to show concern about faraway Ukraine suggests that they think one day they could be looking for similar support from Europe, should China enter into a conflict with one of them.

&gt; * As in Ukraine, the most important factor in Taiwan’s survival is the willingness of its people to defend its hard-earned democracy.

In this view, Putin is only the Siloviki candidate. Had he not been around the former Soviet security apparatus would still have wielded enormous influence behind the scenes in the former soviet states, and they would have used the same playbook of assassinations, false flags, and political manipulation to put someone of their own forward. Or to look at it from a maybe more convincing standpoint: could Putin have existed without the post Soviet security framework? Did he arise because of his own skills and political savviness, or because the country still had an enormous quantity of out of work KGB agents, enormous networks of KGB and military connections, and no strong force to fight it besides public sentiment? Given that Putin rose in popularity directly in connection to a lot of shady shit that very probably relates to plots conducted by the security services, I think the answer is clear that Putin couldn't have existed without them.

Similarly on the Ukrainian's side, it is easy to see that Ukraine would not have survived had not the entire country been changing for a long time. The army was modernized and massively expanded before Zelensky arrived, though it no doubt owes a lot of its success to some of his decisions like appointing fresh and clever military leaders like Zaluzhniy. Nor was this purely the product of Poroshenko's leadership. He took actions which only the political climate allowed. Without Maidan none of the changes in Ukrainian society would have been possible.

Ukraine has ~40 million people -- more than Canada -- and has been fighting a low-key land war with the Russians since 2014.  They've got tons of grain, gas, leftover Soviet gear, plus 8+ years of Western military aid.  

By comparison, Armenia has  ~2.5 million people and no great resources to speak of.  They're in a terrible location geographically -- it's easy to ship hardware to Poland and drive it across the flat, accessible border to UKR -- and have no real natural allies.  If the Russians decide to invade Armenia they certainly could, with results along the lines of North Ossetia / Georgia.    

The Azeris have ~10 million people and lots of natural gas, plus a natural ally in Turkey.  However without Turkey it's doubtful they'd last as long as Ukraine, for many of the same reasons as Armenia.

The US army once did a study and found it wasn't even worth it to draft a bunch of the population because they needed so much supervision it was counter productive. 

1. Ukraine has barely begun mobilization, but unlike Russia they are, indeed, training and equipping additional reserve divisions since the start of the war, they have a huge head start. They are nowhere near complete though and won't be for at least a year.

2. Ukraine's reserves (about 900K) are mostly former conscripts who have served in a warzone. Russia's reserves SAY they have 2M, but they're likely much worse than Ukraine's reserves in a bunch of ways and Russia only really started their reserve system in 2018. By 2020, Russia only really had like 4-5K people in their reserves according to reports.  It is a fake reserve system basically. 

3. Theoretically Russia has  900K+ servicemen to Ukraine's 196K, etc.. but things aren't that simple. A lot of Russia's army is unusable because it is defending other areas of Russia, in the navy, in the air force, or they're conscripts Russia doesn't want to use. Realistically, it might only be around 210K they can use in Ukraine and they've already had a lot of dead and wounded from that number. 

4. Russia should have about 21M men available for an ""all-out"" war, but that's unlikely.  Ukraine is around 7M, but they use a lot more women so it might be closer to 8M. Neither side wants to dip into their ""military age men"" pool though because it could hurt the domestic economy that they need to pay for the war.  It is much better to stick to recently discharged people and reserves.

I don't think it's coincidental that these are essentially the same basic principles that Navies around the world have settled on for seaborne damage control.  And those same basic principles have held solid from the early years of steam (when damage control began to codified) down to today.  USS *Enterprise* (CV-6), USS *Enterprise* (CVN-65), and USS *Enterprise* (CVN-80) could exchange damage control organizations and they'd all ""speak the same language"".

I was too hasty to dismiss your two examples as irrelevant, so I will elaborate on both:

To begin with, my understanding is that the Soloman Islands was not really the US's to lose, but rather Australia's. To add to this, China did not so much as ""salami slice"" them from Australia as Australia sliced off the Solomons, seasoned them, then served them to China with garnish. Australia treated the Solomon Islands like shit and took for them for granted. Furthermore, unless the PLA can put readily deployable ballistic missiles on the island, it will be of virtually no strategic use in a US-China war over Taiwan.

As for Nicaragua, I don't see how one more country switching diplomatic recognition matters anymore. It may have mattered 20 years ago, maybe even 10 years ago, but by now everyone knows the stakes. What difference does Nicaragua switching diplomatic recognition make when Taiwan is already de jure unrecognized by just about the entire planet? What material impact does this have?

And now that the security challenge is returning to peer/near peer conflicts, this era is now over. And adversaries are going to be able to pose serious threats to the US ability to launch sorties, resupply from the air, or have static resources and assets. 

So the recommendations of how to operate an airbase under threat is very important to be aware of. Of course the threat of special forces raids are less so when you are talking about an island thousands of miles away from an opponent.

I do not know if the footage is real, but whether it is or not does not take away from the fact that airbase defense and survivability is a growing concern in the military balance around the world. For the first time since the end of the Cold War the US ability to launch sorties and protect its planes on the ground is under significant threat. And just as it was during the Cold War, a hot war may be decided by the simple ability to repair and protect an airbase. By looking at the lessons of the past and looking at wargaming we will have a better appreciation of what that will take and how to prepare in the future.

If the Russians had known that and how effective the defense of Kyiv would be, they likely would have followed pretty much the exact strategy you are describing.

Then they would have very secure supply lines over the Black Sea, which Ukraine would have zero ability to interdict, plus a land bridge to Moldova for future shenanigans. Basically it would have put the entire Black Sea in the same position as the Crimean bridge: logistically invaluable and functionally immune from Ukrainian attack.

Then, they could have afforded to grind away at the Kyiv defenses over a much longer period of time, and would have been in a much better position to cut off supplies from the west.

&gt; * USAF was conducting Salty Demo, a multiweek airpower exercise. Its goal: Assess whether a modern air base could survive in the face of a heavy and sustained attack.

&gt; * The Air Force was then in the throes of a major effort to guard its ability to generate airpower in Europe. Salty Demo put the effort to the test. USAF was surprised by much of what it learned. Casualties were high. Confusion was great. Sorties were curtailed. Lowly pieces of equipment—for instance, the humble bulldozer—proved to be critically important.

&gt; * …many of the lessons that emerged from Salty Demo can be and, in the view of many, should be applied to overseas air bases.

&gt; * The IAF also struck at targets in Syria, Jordan, and Iraq to destroy a total of 400 aircraft during the first day of combat.

&gt; * They worried about the possibility that massed Soviet air forces could launch a big and successful strike on alliance airfields, much as Israel had done to shattering effect. A rerun of this in Europe could blunt NATO’s airpower edge and undermine the West’s overall military position.

&gt; * After flying hundreds of sorties against Syrian and Egyptian bases, however, the IAF was able to destroy only an estimated 22 enemy aircraft on the ground—compared to more than 400 just six years earlier. The hardening had made the main operating bases much tougher targets.

&gt; * The RAND Corp. had developed a highly detailed computer simulation of an airfield that, in the early 1980s, indicated Warsaw Pact strikes against USAF bases in Europe during the first week of hostilities would cut sortie generation rates by almost 40 percent and destroy 40 percent of deployed aircraft. Such results would obviously severely damage the alliance’s military position.

&gt; * Another group of RAND analysts stated in the mid-1980s, “In Europe, main operating bases (MOBs) and support equipment previously thought survivable may become extremely vulnerable.” These were, at best, educated guesses. Nothing could take the place of real-world experience, but the Air Force thought an exercise might answer some questions. USAF therefore thought up Salty Demo, the purpose of which was to provide a realistic assessment of the various NATO initiatives.

&gt; * Besides people, the most critical resource turned out to be heavy equipment. Day said this machinery was used 24 hours a day in the exercise and was so critical he elected to put it in shelters to protect it. With the airfields and structures requiring constant repair, Day was paradoxically willing to lose an aircraft, but not a bulldozer.

&gt; * “The results,” said Tidal W. McCoy, then assistant secretary of the Air Force for readiness support, “showed even a fairly moderate Soviet attack could reduce our ability to generate sorties. The degradation was especially severe in the first critical week of this demonstration.” McCoy also observed that the outcome of the simulated attacks proved a “shock” to the Air Force.

* Better defend against attacks by enemy special operations forces and commandos.
* Construct more personnel shelters.
* Develop and deploy better chemical suits.
* Increase use of camouflage, concealment, and deception.
* Improve the damage assessment process.
* Deploy more heavy construction vehicles, including armored bulldozers.
* Increase the number of operating surfaces and taxiways.
* Deploy more sets of mobile arresting gear.
* Stockpile runway repair equipment and supplies.",ce644ff3f518b4a6c8868e5e95d3c5b51c9304f4,True,False,,,,,0,1652025853,,0,{},i7t6jlt,True,t3_ul4u3i,False,True,t3_ul4u3i,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ul4u3i/the_lessons_of_salty_demo_a_multiweek_airpower/i7t6jlt/,1652025867,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651997053.0,

Anyway, here are some facts:

Fact 1: the Donbas offensive failed

Fact 2: it failed because Russia was unable to concentrate sufficient forces for the offensive 

Fact 3: Existing troops are getting more exhausted and the combat power is diminishing, so further offensives are unlikely to achieve strategic success

With that Russia will have to gradually shift to a defensive strategy hoping that Ukraine, through attrition and destruction of its economy and infrastructure, will accept a solution that can be dressed as a victory for Russia internally. Ukraine however can choose to tolerate the damage until it’s own combat power (through further mobilization, training and equipment with Western weapons) is able to tip the balance in its favor and go on a strategic offensive to drive the Russians out.

The second option is more likely so to avoid it Russia has really only one solution: mobilization.

People think that mobilization is not going to matter much because it will be untrained conscripts who don’t know how to fight. This is wrong. As Koffman points out retaining conscripts with a stop loss and recalling recently served reservists will create a force that has combat training in its recent past. Then they can undergo additional training for a few months. 

Another point is that the Russian economy will not be able to handle it. Yes Russia will have to at least partially switch to a war economy. But there is no reason to think that Russia’s economy won’t bear the strain considering that in the past many countries have successfully mobilized and fought wars before.

Finally, if mobilization is not practical or useful, why has Ukraine already enacted multiple mobilization waves? Clearly Ukraine sees value in it as it continues to mobilize and I would go as far as to say that battle lines would have looked very different if Ukraine never mobilized.",3be004e33f89060a1855f4c2aed448167115df3d,True,False,,,,,0,1652024967,,0,{},i7t4ipa,False,t3_ukrhnr,False,True,t3_ukrhnr,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ukrhnr/russias_manpower_conundrum_in_ukraine_russia_is/i7t4ipa/,1652024978,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651996167.0,

I'd just like you to know that this isn't my random west-is-best uninformed idea. This is the assessment of my professor on the subject - he teaches at my graduate program now because he just departed a career in defense intelligence, and he spent the last decade of that career as lead on China analysis for the entire agency. 

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has proven that doctrine does not equal behavior. His stance is that the Chinese leadership still has a predisposition towards the notion of whole-of-nation participation in war, including in combat. Hence why they have spent a lot of time considering the mass production of relatively unprotected craft - and the use of civilian craft - for landings. To do this would violate some of the clear principals about battlefield lethality expressed by Stephen Biddle in *Military Power*.

&gt; 
&gt; * EU and Russia are on a brink of a major trade war around oil and gas.
&gt; * Russian energy supplies play a major role in the global market
&gt; 
&gt; * If excluded from global markets, Russian oil and gas will be impossible to replace and substitute in the medium term (up to two years)
&gt; 
&gt; * Over the short term Russia may be quite resilient to the loss of oil and gas sales volumes and may compensate much of it with the price growth
&gt; 
&gt; * Already introduced sanctions have strongly diminished the value of foreign earnings to Russia
&gt; * Russia is looking for a retaliation weapon for the European-imposed sanctions
&gt; 
&gt; * Europe is compelled to make a bold move to compensate for the unwillingness to send troops to assist Ukraine
&gt;

At this point in the conflict it's likely to take Russia at least a decade to rebuild its military to pre-war levels. Probably significantly longer if the sanctions on Russia continue. 

Russia has fired somewhere in the ballpark of 2500 missiles (cruise, ballistic, anti-radiation, anti-ship, etc) since the war began and it will have a hell of a time restocking those especially with sanctions. 

Russia is also visually confirmed to have lost more than 600 tanks so far, including many of their most modern vehicles. Most of Russia's vaunted tank fleet is Soviet-era surplus that they will occasionally refit with upgraded optics, armor, etc. and it will take them many years to recoup the losses they've suffered thus far. Helicopter losses in particular have also been substantial for Russia, including a sizeable portion of their KA-52 attack helicopters. 

On top of all that, the Russian military has been shown to be incompetent, unwieldy, poorly trained, poorly equipped, and poorly led, which I imagine isn't going to do well for their ability to attract and keep talent, something they were struggling with before the war.",9764e9ec78c688875a1daeadc12d0a4313345a6f,True,False,,,,,0,1652012852,,0,{},i7sg6hu,False,t3_ukbt1m,False,True,t1_i7s87lm,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ukbt1m/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_07_2022/i7sg6hu/,1652012865,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651984052.0,

Any guesses on whether the US will go ahead with it (especially if Biden's 30bn ask is passed, or is done through lend lease), and the combat effectiveness of such drones? 

The obvious benefit would be range: this gives highly extended strike capability that will enable Ukraine to harass (or even destroy) the Kerch Bridge (impeding the supply lines of Southern Military District), attack and neutralize the Sevastopol Naval Base, and even a lot of targets deep within sovereign Russian territory itself. 

The con, compared to TB2 is that its much more expensive (16-20m vs \~2m), and seems abit larger (at least 30% in wingspan and length), which give a larger radar signature.

The Israelis did suffer strategic surprise, the airforce had exact plans for SEAD and DEAD operations against both the Egyptian and the Syrian AD networks ""tegar"" and ""dugman 5"". When the war started the IAF began executing tegar operation against the Egyptians, but due to the high losses ob the ground and the Syrian break through in the Golan, the operation was called off, the Israeli air force was ordered to operate CAS without first suppressing and destroying enemy AD and suffered extremely high losses for it (though did manage to help stall the Syrian advance).

Later, SEAD and DEAD operations were complicated by the fact that Israeli intel on enemy batteries was old by that later point, and the airforce itself was degraded and stretched thin, and so continued slowly. But still by the end of the war, much of the Egyptian AD umbrella was broken and the Syrian one severely degraded.

Sure breaking from doctrine and working CAS without SEAD and DEAD would cause extreme losses against any AD, but that's hardly a good example to generalize. 

1982, and the recent engagements in Syria, Libya and NKR have shown that Russian AD is somewhat overhyped.

The west would send Troops into Ukraine and to the eastern front there, Putin then would have the option to:

A: (if he is isn't totally unhinged) 

Either fight a conventional war there, knowing he would lose, be pushed out of Ukraine and enter peace talks. 

He'd speculate that west won't want to continue the war after having cleared Ukraine and be able to justify the loss against NATO internally by saying that they were sabotaging his efforts in secret from the beginning. Then he would go into isolation, put up another iron curtain and concentrate on trade and relations with China and India. He'd promise to rebuild his military for a future war against NATO and save face toward his people.

B: (if he is less than sane) 

Fight for a bit before threatening nuclear attack.

Then demand NATO and Ukraine to enter peace talks and acknowledge Russian dominion over part or all the occupied territory in the Ukraine, hoping that NATO does not want to risk nuclear war and won't care about the territorial loss in Ukraine enough to risk future escalation.

If the west agrees to peace talks he can save face and gain territory in the Ukraine. If the west does not he'll slowly increase pressure, detonating a tactical nuke or dirty bomb somewhere on Ukrainian soil, believing NATO won't enter his borders for fear of nuclear escalation.

If neither A nor B work he then has a standoff with NATO at his borders, and can move back into cold war posturing waiting for the situation to cool off enough while binding US attention towards Russia and hoping for a deescalation.

Key Takeaways

Russian forces destroyed several bridges to slow Ukrainian forces and may be conducting a limited withdrawal northeast of Kharkiv city in the face of the successful Ukrainian counteroffensive.

Ukrainian forces are making significant progress around Kharkiv and will likely advance to the Russian border in the coming days.

Ukrainian forces continued to repel Russian advances toward Barvinvoke and Russian forces have likely abandoned efforts to drive directly southeast toward Slovyansk. ISW cannot confirm claims of a Ukrainian counteroffensive toward Izyum at this time.

Russian forces claimed to capture Popasna on May 7 but remain largely stalled in eastern Ukraine.

The Ukrainian government confirmed the last remaining civilians trapped in the Azovstal plant evacuated on May 7, though the remaining Ukrainian defenders appear unlikely to surrender. ISW will likely be unable to report any discrete changes in control of terrain until Russian forces capture the plant as a whole due to the poor information environment in Mariupol.

By all indications, Russian forces will announce the creation of a Kherson People’s Republic or possibly forcibly annex Kherson Oblast in the coming weeks to cement its occupation administration and attempt to permanently strip these territories from Ukraine.

Russian forces continued to target Odesa with cruise missile strikes and conduct false-flag attacks in Transnistria over the past several days.",fe50b52a5558c8cec6784e9fa70f22d0d3acdddb,True,False,,,,,0,1651982553,,0,{},i7rcgub,False,t3_ukbt1m,False,True,t3_ukbt1m,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ukbt1m/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_07_2022/i7rcgub/,1651982566,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651953753.0,

It can be relatively difficult to get good understanding of the Ukrainian conflict because so many of the forums/sources to discuss are heavily biased and contain a lot of low effort cheer-posting or very basic analysis.   
I think it would be useful if this sub which is better at avoiding those instincts could create a guide to good sources from both sides to gain a good understanding of the conflict.  
A broad outline:  
1. Primary Sources (Official Government Statements, On-the front commentators , people in Russia and Ukraine with privileged levels of access, maybe channels posting combat footage especially if they tend to post it first)   
Some primary sources that are important to understanding the conflict are going to be quite biased and inaccurate. I.e I think having links to the Russian defense ministry and too very influential pro-russian commentators is in important to understanding how Russia is presenting the war to its own people. Instead of not including these sources I think there use and limitations should be described.   
I would propose organizing them first dividing by Platform then divided by Bias then divide by language.  
A. Print Media  
B. Twitter  
I: Pro-Russian Sources  
\- Russian Language   
\- English  
II: Pro-Ukranian Sources  
III: Neutral Sources   
2. Secondary Sources (Analysts, Journalists, aggregators etc)  
I would propose a similar organization scheme but include a label about what they do i.e OSINT, commentator, etc and also some sort of rough rating based on a couple of characteristics i.e  
1. Accuracy (Very low to Very high) - How accurate are their statements on reporting what happened.   
2. Rapidity - Does this person tend to report events very quickly or lag behind   
3. Level of Understanding - How well does this commentator understand the concepts he's talking about.

[],False,,MegaZeroX7,,,[],,,,text,t2_dthe8,False,False,"First, I don't think its fair to compare Taiwan's current military with the 2014 Ukrainian military, because there is a large gap between the two.

Second, Ukraine's problem in 2014 wasn't a lack of will to resist, but it being sudden, in the middle of an already chaotic domestic situation, and Ukraine not really having a professional military.

Third, strategically, Taiwan has TSMC, which will likely lead to it seeing pretty good international support.

Fourth, the idea of morale is rather nebulous, and most places have strong morale against foreign invaders throughout history. They may be unprepared, sure. But not just lying down and giving up.

Fifth, we already saw the massive resistance in Hong Kong when Hong Kong didn't even have a military, was already part of China, and the measures were implemented rather slowly. And, we saw strong support from people in the west, when it didn't even have much of geopolitical importance.

Then you actually have to consider if China could even do this in the first place.

If China goes for an amphibious assault:

1) This would half to be the biggest amphibious assault of all time if it is supposed to succeed

2) Only the west coast of Taiwan is viable, which will allow the Taiwanese to concentrate defenses there

3) The west coast also just happens to be where TSMC fabs are, which China will need to be careful not to destroy, since its a huge part of Taiwan's value in the first place

4) They somehow need to plan and prepare this logistical nightmare without the world noticing ahead of time like it did with Ukraine.

If they want to go the blockade route:

1) Taiwan may be strongly reliant on foreign imports, but it still produces 35% of its own food itself. It isn't like China can do a 30 day blockade and call it a day.

2) Blockade of an island the size of Taiwan is very much non-trivial, particularly considering they would need to strongly block off air supply as well.

3) If they don't want to slowly be attritioned from the shoreline, then their forces need to be pretty far out, which makes the blockade lose its effectiveness.

4) They somehow need to plan and prepare this logistical nightmare without the world noticing ahead of time like it did with Ukraine.

5) Starving Taiwan would give time for opposition to form globally, and the more it impacts Taiwan and the world sees it, the stronger the opposition gets

The force that would have to deal with these overwhelming factors is a military which hasn't seen any real combat since the 70s and is incredibly corrupt.

All of this isn't to say that China can't do it, but IMO people are to ready to make the same mistake that people did with Russia and Ukraine.",41f1681aa81e59d6ddd2e9408f68f422fe70b791,True,False,,,,,0,1651974237,,0,{},i7qx3so,False,t3_ukbt1m,False,True,t1_i7qfwcc,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ukbt1m/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_07_2022/i7qx3so/,1651974253,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651945437.0,

Going to continue checking daily updates for the next few days to see if the mobilization meme materializes. Predictions based on observations so far: 

1. Russia will most likely squeeze Ukrainian forces out of Luhansk Oblast' by early June if they can keep building on the success of capturing Rubizhne and Popasna

2. Russia will probably fail to encircle Slovyansk and Kramatorsk, let alone the entirety of Donetsk Oblast'

3. Russia will probably try to attack Zaporizhya and secure Kherson Oblast', but I fail to see them threaten Mykolaiv/Odesa aside from shelling.

4. Ukraine will most likely need a lot more materiel courtesy of the lend-lease to start taking back territory, and won't try a major counter-offensive until at least mid-summer.

5. This war will most likely keep going until:

a) One side can no longer finance it (for Ukraine this means losing support from West, for Russia this means full oil/at least partial gas embargo)

b) One side culminates in available force (for Ukraine this means receiving large amounts of Western materiel, for Russia this means effective mobilization, or, less likely, using nukes)

In Conclusion:

Unless the West gives up on further support (in form of sanctions, weapons, and economic aid), I think Ukraine will probably outlast Russia, forcing them to capitulate at least some if not the majority of captured territory, whether by force or through negotiations.",c274c6cb7c83605b6c9488fa9249a08e6ef126f9,True,False,,,,,0,1651973920,,0,{},i7qwhab,False,t3_ukbt1m,False,False,t3_ukbt1m,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ukbt1m/ukraine_conflict_megathread_may_07_2022/i7qwhab/,1651973934,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651945120.0,

With nothing to add to it.  But let me address your next response since it also addresses the one route being easier than the other:

&gt;Why do you think more civilians are cleared than military personnel?

Which is is something I addressed:

\&gt;Yes, and **most of those are folks who work in technical fields.**

\&gt;**OP isn't talking about a modeler at Skunk Works, he's talking about analyst or policy work.** And you're competing against an absolute gorillion number of **former** commissioned or enlisted who not only have a clearance but experience in the field.

No doubt in my mind more civilians(although I would add vets are also civilians) get clearances than military personnel.  This is because of the enormous number of technical personnel needed to staff and support the towering edifice that is the American Military-Industrial Complex.  Other than things like IT, technical positions are not likely to be sourced from ex-military.  For the purposes of this argument, finance and economic analysis counts as ""technical"".

But to repeat one more time:  OP is not talking about a modeler somewhere designing an invisible monkey for Army Research Lab; he is talking about analysis and policy work.  And in this field the competition is often ex-military.

Go back to your original comment.

&gt; I really can't tell if you're being intentionally obtuse here. Companies would rather have someone who already has a clearance because then they get the contract fulfilled quicker. You know and I know customers don't want hold ups for a contract, and building a personnel team made of people hired off the street without clearances is a good way to hold up a contract being carried out.

Why do you think more civilians are cleared than military personnel?

I'll wait with bated breath.

&gt; I see below you're an FSO. Civil Service is definitely one of those places where they don't care about contracts or how long a billet takes to be filled. I would also add that the FSO world is just a teeny tiny bit different in terms of coming aboard as a GS; most positions don't require something like the FSOT.

No it isn't.

&gt;Joining the military in commissioned roles is difficult

It isn't *easy* but it isn't especially *difficult*.

&gt;No, it is not misleading. NISPOM explicitly allows companies to hire on Conditional Offer. **Without paying people to sit around.**

I really can't tell if you're being intentionally obtuse here.  Companies would rather have someone who already has a clearance because then they get the contract fulfilled quicker.  You know and I know customers don't want hold ups for a contract, and building a personnel team made of people hired off the street without clearances is a good way to hold up a contract being carried out.

&gt;You should know that I'm an FSO 

I addressed this in my edit:


\&gt;EDIT: I see below you're an FSO. Civil Service is definitely one of those places where they don't care about contracts or how long a billet takes to be filled. I would also add that the FSO world is just a teeny tiny bit different in terms of coming aboard as a GS; most positions don't require something like the FSOT.",876a54e66374dc1841a17b79bac6beb867341397,True,False,,,,,0,1651968168,,0,{},i7qliow,False,t3_ukiys0,False,True,t1_i7qkkzc,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ukiys0/so_youre_starting_a_masters_degree_program_and/i7qliow/,1651968182,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1651939368.0,
