[],False,,Shuttlecockblock,,,[],,,,text,t2_kn8wk,False,False,"You completely missed what he is trying to say. Of course the Ukrainians have a right to defend, and they should. There is nothing wrong with defending your home and I’m happy to see them resisting so well. However, from a human standpoint it is incredibly sad from both sides. Obviously Ukraine has suffered much more from a civilian standpoint, it’s awful. But while Ukraine is in the right, his point is that there are many many Russians soldiers that are basically kids who have been conscripted, many of whom have not participated in atrocities. Not only are they lied to about why they are even there, many are sent in as cannon fodder. This is not to say Ukraine shouldn’t bomb them, they have no choice as they are in a war. Yes there are many Russian soldiers that are getting exactly what they deserve because of crimes committed, but just because we support Ukraine doesn’t mean we can’t recognize how terrible this is for many who have been conscripted, lied to, and ultimately forgotten about by a government that doesn’t care about them. I would recommend watching the linked video if you have a chance. This Ukrainian interviews many captured and wounded Russian soldiers and has lots of videos and the story is almost always the same at the beginning. They literally think they were going to fight Nazis and liberate Ukraine or else they aren’t told anything at all. Some still thought they were participating in training until the gunfire started. It’s much harder for these soldiers to find alternative information other than propaganda as Russia does not allow the free flow of information like the west does. 

All that said, yes celebrate Ukraine’s victories, be happy when they have success. I’ll admit I’m glad to see videos where they win these skirmishes and battles. But don’t sit behind a keyboard and try to strip away the humanity from soldiers being blown to bits on camera. You can celebrate Ukraine’s victories without insulting soldiers on a personal level as if their entire existence was trash.

If russia seriously wanted to use nukes they would do it and would not send hordes of ""concerned"" trolls and kremlin parrots on social media with ""serious questions"" what would happen if Russia actually uses „tactical nukes“ in Ukraine"", or ""russia state tv issues warning"" etc.. 

Their continuously affirming that they, in fact, really really really really for sure, and you have to believe them, they do, seriously, they do, have tactical nukes. And that they, as a fact can use them. 
Is a clear indication that they are a dog that is barking behind the fence.

The more the Kremlin spends on trying to push the narrative they are a nuclear superpower, the more I doubt them!

Let's compare the silent nuclear power, and the one barking behind the fence:

The US currently has 5500 warheads (including stockpile), and russia has about 6000.

Nuclear bombs need to be maintained. Nuclear material oxidizes and tritium decays fast (let alone maintenance and calibration of detonators/very finicky triggers, electronics, batteries and even propulsion). Overall a warhead needs to be rebuilt every ~10 years (depending on size and yield).

So the US spends 60B usd/year on maintaining their nuclear arsenal:

https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57240

The total budget russia spends on their whole military is about 65 Billion:

https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/RUS/russia/military-spending-defense-budget

The numbers don't add up for them to claim their arsenal is up to date and I doubt the majority is usable.",b9d6dcdbbb5c37d7150033ba4e6abefb0d95b0b0,True,False,,,,,0,1652039296,,0,{},i7u1bi3,False,t3_ul6355,False,False,t3_ul6355,/r/UkraineConflict/comments/ul6355/russian_state_television_issues_brazen_warning_to/i7u1bi3/,1652039314,1,True,True,False,UkraineConflict,t5_30oyx,r/UkraineConflict,public,,0,[],,1652010496.0

As for the rest of it, Economic policies have a lag time.

&gt; KYIV, May 7 - Ukraine&amp;#039;s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said diplomatic efforts were underway to save the remaining fighters holed up inside the Azovstal steelworks in the city of Mariupol, as more civilians were evacuated from the bombed-out plant.

&gt; Zelenskiy said in a late-night video address that Ukraine was working on a diplomatic effort to save defenders barricaded inside the steelworks.

&gt; Moscow calls its actions a &amp;quot;Special military operation&amp;quot; to disarm Ukraine and rid it of what it calls anti-Russian nationalism fomented by the West.Ukraine and the West say Russia launched an unprovoked war and have accused Russian forces of war crimes.
