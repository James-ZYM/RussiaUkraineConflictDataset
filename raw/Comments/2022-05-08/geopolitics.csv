That audience wants a certain narrative about American dominance on the international stage.

If we are talking about global competition, potentially in relation to war, these factors are extremely important. Services especially are reliant on IP rights which are a controversial topic and obfuscate real production - does it really matter who holds the IP of a television set if the Chinese factory produces a million of them, as well as the chips, transistors, screws, plastic, and screens? Who's gonna get the displays they need if there is a war? In gdp figures, China gets only the cost of television as its output (I'm making up the numbers but let's say it's $400) and the TV retails for $900. So the US added $500 in value which counts towards their GDP. 

Does this make any sense in trying to evaluate geopolitical rivals ? 


Disregarding energy production, for example, is another flaw. Germany and Russia have the same ppp gdp - yet without Russian energy, Germany will slowly collapse. Most of its gdp is based on energy intensive (70% of costs are energy in some cases) industrial exports (40% of German gdp is exports) which will become uncompetitive when energy costs balloon. Russia also produces more steel and more ships than Germany.

UN auditors, in an attempt to recover the loans, revealed that one of the companies used the funds to 'discharge pre-existing debts and liabilities', while most projects remain incomplete or are yet to begin. Member states' trust in the agency have eroded as a result, with Finland withdrawing it's pledge of $20 million, and the complete evaluation of the matter is only due by June, 2024. There is also a lack of public accountability, with UNOPS so far refusing to provide a reason for the selection of Ms. Daisy's non-profit as a recipient of funds, and the UN declining to comment on the results of the internal investigations completed in the past week. This misappropriation of funds is especially egregious during a time when the United Nations is calling for more donations to assist with the multiple ongoing global crises.

To me though, ""first tier"" implies capability, particularly at fulfilling the needs of the nation. The UK military does not have to be big to satisfy its needs. Some of this is due to NATO, but they are capable (and importantly proven) in their ability to deploy overseas and fight highly effectively in combat with similar results to the US's capabilities in terms of combined arms use, avoidance of casualties, and effectiveness in achieving operational objectives.

Obviously the British military would be unsuitable for Israel, which is primarily focused on defense against other Middle East nations and Palestinian insurgents. Likewise, a large navy would be of little use to the IDF, so wisely they avoid investing in it. Also, Israel has little reason for large foreign deployments, relying instead on its highly effective special forces for important interventions.

I can't really say that North Korea is a first tier military in spite of their size, due to aging equipment, likely low morale of troops, and a lack of confidence that military analysts have in any of their doctrine or tactics. 

Speaking of analysts, they got Russia wrong, but France and the UK are consistently ranked highly: https://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-listing.php

I consider them and Israel higher because they actually have a great deal of field operations for us to observe and see in action. South Korea, for example, I have less confidence in even though on paper they should be quite strong.

that they're from a different province or city. An individual from Beijing, for instance, may actively look down upon someone from another city due to the Hukou system. 

China, much like a number of Asian countries, does not promote individuality. The more you differ from the masses, whether that be physically or culturally, the more societal pressure there is. For instance, awhile back a chinese model, who was modeling for an international consumer base, was harrased out of her job for looking too different from the established beauty standards in China. The fact that you're an immigrant makes this much worse. 

Furthermore, while the government is going ahead with increasing immigration, there are very few laws and institutions that deal with prejudice. If racial slurs get thrown at you, I don't think there's that much you can do. 

tbf, the more well educated a person is, the more well behaved they tend to be. The issue with this is that educated people tend to live in big cities. Housing prices in big cities are quite steep and most immigrants(most people for that matter) may not have access to that kind of wealth. 

A large number of immigrants to China are ethnically Han Chinese. Those people who either emigrated out or their decedents who changed their mind or never decided to stay in the first place. The problem with this is that China appears to be growing more authoritarian, which is one of the reasons that certain households or businesses moved out to begin with.

US never really intended to build a world order, but did it as a side effect to dismantling European empires, which plunged the world into total wars.

For now, it seems China simply wants global trade to continue and have its immediate neighbors to show deference and not act unilaterally without consulting them.  However this pushed to an extreme could have a huge impact.

Life in US would probably be least affected.  US is pretty self-sufficient.  It’s standard of living may suffer a bit if China is calling shots in international trade.  US will likely adopt much more mercantilistic trade policies, since if Chinese companies are allowed to come back and dominate US economy (Chinese companies start picking up US domestic businesses), then it will adversely affect market dynamics, since US government will have to go into business of propping up incumbent US companies against state-backed Chinese companies.  If this were to happen, startups will find disrupting the market very difficult, and sunsetting of non-competitive companies (so called creative destruction) will not happen as they should.  Innovation would be strongly stifled in this case.

The most affected countries will be those with strong economic dependence on China, especially those neighboring China.  Their industries and companies will never be allowed to develop to the point of challenging Chinese businesses.  Under US hegemony, businesses from aligned countries could take business away from American companies if they produced superior products or similar products more cheaply.  Sony took CRT (cathode ray tube, not critical race theory) TV business away from RCA, Toyota took car business away from Chrysler &amp; GM, Toshiba &amp; Hitachi took DRAM business from Intel, Samsung took mobile phone business away from Motorola, and the list goes on.  US is not very nationalistic when it comes to industry, so if another company can do better, they are allowed to take the business.  This would never happen with under the Chinese watch.  Chinese companies are extensions of the government, so foreign companies taking business away from Chinese companies is in effect weakening of Chinese government. What this means is that companies that do business primarily with China will never become a leader in that sector, and their profit will be what Chinese policies allow.  Hence lower standard of living for employees of non-Chinese companies doing business in China.

So once these countries are under China’s economic influence, their sovereignty will be affected.  Their politicians would not be allowed to criticize China or institute policies that upset Chinese prosperity (like tariffs or funding development of businesses that could undermine Chinese interests).  

Because US is a democracy and its voters are mostly oblivious of the world affairs, therefore US cares only about a few things that grab people’s attention (like its cherished ideology being offended, or oil price goes sky high), but lets most things go on.  China would be different. They have much to prove to themselves and to the world. They want to let everyone to know they are are powerful and not to be trifled with, and to let the world know the world’s business is their business (China is much strongly coupled with the world than US).

Have you ever read “Radical Inclusion” by general Martin Dempsey and Ori Braffman?

Similar thesis but for business and organizational leadership.

Basically there is no way anyone can be an expert in everything, and the information cycle is way too fast for the traditional general or ceo role to maintain situational awareness on the battle or business space.

I think that’s one of the reasons the US has been successful is providing small group leaders the opportunity to accomplish objectives set by leadership using tactics they select for the specific conditions, versus dictating everything about the operation to the platoon leaders.

Western aid doesn't deny Ukrainians agency to fight or surrender of course, but let's not pretend it didn't figure into the calculus to stay and fight.

But it is the Ukrainians who forced the US/ NATO to provide them with the weapons.  I think that it is backward to suggest that the US is somehow pushing weapons to Ukraine and forcing them to fight.  The opposite is true.  The US was quite slow to provide the weaponry that the Ukrainians needed.  In February, they were pressuring Zelensky to leave and set up a government-in-exile and then perhaps manage a cold war scenario through sanctions.  One of Zelensky's advisors said that instead of providing weapons, the only thing the West was offering was exile abroad.  It was really Zelensky telling all the ""concerned Western diplomats"" off and staying in Kyiv, his subsequent public lobbying in Europe and the US, and the AFU's surprisingly good performance in the early days that got them the guns they needed.  In that way, Ukraine is the one pulling the strings rather than just being the US proxy.  Ukraine refused to play by the script that Western diplomats and analysts had written for it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That's not what the person you commented to stated. I read it as this being an opportunity for Europe to collectively come together and shake off American reliance for continental defence in lieu of a wholly European one.

That is not where this poster is going if you look at his/her other comments.  He/she doesn't see Russia as a real country and thinks that the great powers are just splitting it apart for resources.  This is just an argument that Europe should get in on the power struggle rather than just letting the US and Russia split up the goodies.  I'm assuming he/she is basically just arguing for Poland grabbing Western Ukraine and Hungary grabbing Transcarpathia.  This is the same dark view of the world that Mearshemeir and other pro-Russia academics have and it also tracks with Putin's view of the world where he is allowed to just grab Ukraine because it is part of Russia.  This denies Ukraine's nationhood and agency.

[],False,,DrPepperMalpractice,,,[],,,,text,t2_40jnvhxm,False,False,"I don't think the Chinese slowdown is just in paper. I think it's really hard to understate how much the US-Chinese trade war and Covid have fundamentally altered the Chinese place in the world. Large companies are starting to realize dealing with the CCP is a liability. Covid has screwed up all kinds of production and inevitably has caused companies to retool supply chains. 

China is also going through a population bust.  While it's hard to get good data out of China, the data they release shows a heavily inverted population pyramid. China has been a source of cheap labor for decades. A growing middle class and a shrinking labor pool is likely already affecting production costs, but it's going to get worse for at least a couple decades. Non-chinese companies see this, and it's changing the calculus as to where to set up shop. In a globalized world, buyers are going to go where the products are cheap. 

The really big issue to China is that it's current economic and political system has been design with year over year double digit growth as a given. They done stuff like overbuild an expensive a high speed rail network as stimulus with the assumption that economic growth would allow them to cover the expenses. They have also built a ticking timebomb in their housing market. It's really hard to overstate how bad the collapse of the Chinese housing market could get. The great majority of Chinese household investment is tied up in real estate. Local governments get a huge chunk of their revenue from selling land to developers. If that value is erased, a lot of bad stuff happens with the Chinese economy. Whether the market implodes or is kept in check through heavy handed government policy, this will continue to be a boat anchor on the economy. 

At the end of the day, it's really hard for westerners to know what's going on in China. As an outsider though, it appears like the facade of  the Chinese Miracle is beginning to crack. China has kept it's head down significantly more with the crisis in Ukraine than I would have expected. The CCP's perpetuation of the Zero Covid policy also seems illogical and is weakening their economy. Actions like these certainly don't seem to be coming from a place of political strength.

[],False,,akyriacou92,,,[],,,,text,t2_awa1io0,False,False,"Ok, there's so much wrong here to begin with. You're mixing up the EU and NATO. NATO was an anti-communist defensive pact against the USSR. Turkey and Russia have a long history of rivalry and conflicts over control of the Black Sea, Caucasus, Balkans and even the Crimea. The USSR was seen as a threat by the Turkish government, an Turkey had vital strategic importance to the Western powers, given its control of the Turkish straits and proximity to the Middle East, Black Sea and Caucasus. It made perfect sense for Turkey to be in NATO, where it had the second largest military after the United States.

Fun fact, the USSR offered to join NATO in the 1950s. The Soviets did not expect NATO to say yes, the offer was made to prove that NATO was an anti-Soviet alliance. However, if Western leaders had gotten really drunk or something and said yes, then the Soviets would have gone through with joining, and thus NATO would have ceased to be an anti-Soviet organization. It was a win-win for the Soviets.

After 1991 and the collapse of the USSR and Warsaw Pact, the situation might have changed, but personally I think it was never likely that Russia really wanted to be in NATO, despite what Putin claims. Russia joining NATO would have meant subjected themselves to the rules of western nations and losing some autonomy as a superpower. What I think Russia wanted was for NATO to be disbanded and replaced with (or NATO being restricted into) a pan-European alliance in which US power in Europe is limited and Russia is granted special privileges in Eastern Europe. This would have meant the right to intervene in the affairs of its neighbours and retain some of the influence of the USSR. 

Superpowers don't join the alliance of their rivals. Russia will not join NATO unless there's a fundamental change in Russia's political structure and public perception of itself and its relationship with the West.

Defense spending has been shown to be one of the most prolific sources of innovation as evidenced by the technological breakthroughs made by agencies like DARPA, NASA, etc. Generally if a new technology is created by the government it is given for free to the private sector to iterate upon and improve. This is clearly seen in companies like SpaceX/Blue Origin/etc.

These kinds of policies you propose tend to lean socialist/communist. China is a good example of what you are proposing with their five-year plans and massive state involvement in the private sector. You even cite the Soviet Union as an example of massive planned housing projects. 

Having the government “bet” on technologies and push them can lead to massive amounts of wasted time and money if you make a bad bet. Cutting-edge tech is a highly volatile field where massive amounts of spending could yield very little results. AI could come to dominate the world or we could easily run into a road block somewhere that stops progress in the field for a decade. How many years have we been hearing about fusion energy and graphene for example.

America fundamentally does not believe in top-down governmental economic management except in certain sectors that are deemed necessary. These sectors are primarily agriculture, defense, energy, and recently green tech. This is due to a belief that free markets have greater ability to bring technologies to the masses and spur greater innovation.

Their air forces and naval forces were always second to the West because of the inherent disparity in military funding/technological capacity but still in that time - they were number 2 in those things too.

I saved this post and I will put it here in the thread. Basically I have a lot of concerns about China but I really don’t know what the worst case scenario or even likely outcome will be if the CCP has all of their wishes fulfilled in the coming decades. 

“Big picture, China is taking step by deliberate step toward its goals, and we have no reason to believe they are only regional. China is in a place in this world order and globalized world that it has never been in before.  Some would look to Chinese history in order to predict behavior today. I would instead look at the behavior of autocrats who have ruled over major powers.  
Xi Jinping was quoted saying he aims for the world to be dependent on China so the CCP can maintain great influence. We might not be seeing troops landing in California any time soon but it’s a warning and we shouldn’t expect Xi will treat others around the world any better than he treats his own people such as Tibetans and Uyghurs. China has Orwellian layers on top of the racism, environmental, and other problems you see elsewhere in the world. 

Additionally, China is pushing boundaries with its grey zone actions. Individually they may not warrant a sharp response, but cumulatively they certainly do. 

So much of the world is entangled with China, and some reasonable degree of decoupling seems rational.  However, if China takes Taiwan, it will control the majority of current-gen chips made by TSMC. Chips required for the internet, phones, computers, vehicles, defense, and a host of other technology we all take for granted. China simply cannot control the world’s supply of semiconductors. That would be the stark opposite of decoupling. 

The CCP may soon eclipse the U.S. but it need not eclipse the free world. Every partner is crucial in tipping the scale in favor of the rights and values associated with democracy.

Could it be Russia’s culture that causes most of these problems?

But on the other hand, the Ukrainians with their adept command of mission control are a foil to this idea as they are much better than the Russians at mission control despite sharing very similar cultures and nearly identical cultural values. 

Could it be that the Ukrainians with their NATO training have in a way, overruled their natural culture “instinct” or does their information advantage, make it look that way? Or are they just heeding their NATO advisors and their style of command? This to me is a interesting question as to which aspect has more relevancy: does culture dictate command or does training dictate command or is it a mixture of the two?
