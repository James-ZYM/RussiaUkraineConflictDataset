You didn't disagree that it was a stepping stone to build up Russia's policy on force, you went on a massive tangent about how it also eroded Russia's trust in the west for no discernible reason (except possibly to justify that use of force).

I don't know if I'm buying this one. Russia has a demonstrated history of falsehood, duh. Ukraine hasn't demonstrated the same willingness to lie. The most Ukraine has done is be a little too aggressive in their public diplomacy, perhaps exaggerating kill counts.

[],False,,Norseman2,,,[],,,,text,t2_36zfy,False,False,"&gt;Number two I consider to be the frontrunner. Zelenskyy has already expressed his willingness to negotiate regarding NATO and territorial gains for the Russians. Basically, as much as Russia is hurting economically, Ukraine is hurting physically. I think at this point it's a question of will regarding Russian and Ukrainian losses. I don't think Zelenskyy is hard enough to keep going, unless he genuinely believed the alternative was probably his death and the destruction of Ukraine. My point is that I think he's willing to make significant concessions to Putin.

This seems dubious. Russia has shown no reason to be trusted. They signed the Budapest Memorandum giving security assurances to Ukraine which read (in part):

&gt;The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm their obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine, and that none of their weapons will ever be used against Ukraine except in self-defence or otherwise in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. 

But then Russia annexed Crimea, armed separatists to seize Donbas, then claimed they were doing military exercises on the border as a prelude to invade the whole country and start blowing up hospitals. Then they repeatedly attacked during supposed ""ceasefires"" for negotiations.

At this point, it is painfully obvious to all sides that Russia will not treat anything it says or signs as binding. Russia will do whatever Putin (or the next autocrat) wants to do, regardless of laws and treaties. Their assurances aren't worth a fart in a whirlwind.

I suspect Zelenskyy realizes this and wants to give people hope for a peaceful resolution. Realistically however, their only option for now is to keep fighting. With continued support for Ukraine and heavy sanctions against Russia, the Russian military may eventually be drained to such a point that they are no longer willing or able to attack Ukraine. When that happens, they could at least sign a ceasefire which could possibly last for a few years and try to get into NATO before Russia can recover. That's the only plausible way I see that the war ends for good.",369b07dd7264bac5c2ec13b8b6e5675ef7d446f0,True,False,,,,,0,1646941573,,0,{},i05avat,False,t3_tb0olp,False,True,t1_i04rjcn,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tb0olp/russia_changes_conscription_laws/i05avat/,1646941588,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646912773.0,

There's an interesting comment on /r/askhistorians let me see if I can find it...

[found it](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/t0gj2p/megathread_on_recent_events_in_ukraine/hyaegk6/) copying below


&gt; There's still a great deal of debate on this in political science circles, but it's hard to say from historical evidence that
sanctions alone work.

&gt; Hufbauer, Schott, and Elliot tried to do a database, [which you can find here](https://www.piie.com/summary-economic-sanctions-episodes-1914-2006).

&gt; The one that might look most promising on the table is in 1925 with League of Nations vs. Greece, where the League of Nations supposedly used economic sanctions to force Greece from withdrawing from Bulgaria (the so-called War of the Stray Dog) but unfortunately their table is in error here -- the tipping point was instead a show of naval force.

&gt;More typical for a success (and it does get a score of 16 on the table) is instead the Guatemala crisis of 1993. The President Serrano tried to suspend the constitution and dissolve the Congress and essentially make a totalitarian state. There was a great deal of protest, and this ended up getting combined with sanctions pressure (from both the US and Europe) to get business owners also concerned. The army also sided against the president. This was sufficient to cause Serrano to resign and flee. Notice this is essentially a case where popular sentiment was flowing one direction already and sanctions gave an extra push.

&gt;In the mixed-success category would be UNITA vs. MPLA conflict in Angola, tied in with the so-called ""blood diamonds"". There had long been a proxy war in Angola (funded by the US and USSR in the 80s) but in the 90s there was a return to conflict in '92, and the UN did sanctions with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1173 and later 1295 specifically targeting ""blood diamonds"" which reportedly were financing the UNITA effort. This led to the Kimberley Process Certification scheme which did significant damage to UNITA's financing, and after a great amount of desertion there was a major military win of MPLA against UNITA in 1999 before they collapsed entirely. This was a civil war where the sanctions helped reduced the ability of one of the sides to operate militarily, and there is no doubt this helped lead to the later victory.

&gt;I won't go through every example, but the basic thread is that economic sanctions alone only work if there's some other factor that causes a change. You can also try

&gt;Pape, R. A. (1997). Why economic sanctions do not work. International security, 22(2), 90-136.

&gt;and the arrestingly-titled sequel

&gt;Pape, R. A. (1998). Why economic sanctions still do not work. International Security, 23(1), 66-77.

There are two different paths here, at least as far as I am aware.

The first is the more micro level, which is that the more tied up a sector is in the global economy (especially in connection to Europe), the worse it will fare. Russia auto industry, for example, is already ceasing producing in some areas because they depend on Europe so heavily for parts. Civil aviation is another, and there is a reason why Russia is talking about nationalizing the airlines right now, because Aeroflot is basically nothing if they can't fly over European airspace and they will not survive to summer without government intervention. 

But that still leaves a lot of the economy and doesn't seem especially catastrophic, which is where the blocking sanctions on the central bank come in at a more macro level. Russia, like most governments, prefers to conduct business in Dollars or Euros, first because the Ruble is too unstable in normal times, and secondly because they get better rates do so than if they used Rubles. That is why the Russian central bank held, until recently, large quantities of Dollars and Euros in reserve. 

Right now, Russia and some of its state companies (think Rosneft, Gazprom, Uralkali) have debt coming due, and they have three choices. The first is to pay in Dollars or Euros, which is not a sustainable long term solution because Russia lost access to most of its reserves and cannot get more (which is why the government limited how much foreign currency people can withdraw, they physically need to keep western currency in their banking system in order to pay off debts). The second is to pay in gold, which involves amassing large quantities of physical gold, something Russia has been doing but is also not sustainable long term. The third is to pay in Rubles, which is sustainable long-term because Russia can just print more Rubles, but not without inflating the currency even more. It's essentially the same debt-trap that Weimar Germany found itself in. Hyperinflation is the end result.

If/when that eventually happens, any Russian industry that even remotely relies on imports will be hurt as the Ruble craters even lower than it is right now, and the import costs for Russian businesses skyrocket. The thing that I think some people are missing is that, while the sanctions are from the west only, the debt crunch and the declining value of the Ruble impact everything.

Meanwhile the Russian logistics train can not really supply more men and equipment they already have in Ukraine. Well, they can not supply what they have, but certainly not more. So reinforcements can and are still used to replenish losses, but not really to ramp up agression. And while sanctions do take time to making their presence acutely felt... it is time that Russia is running out of.

Ukraine obviously also has problems that are exasperated by time, in particular Mariupol.

[],False,,MercuryAI,,,[],,,,text,t2_l1rx2,False,False,"I think that's the point that the Russians cease to be able to continue viable combat operations, if not withdraw entirely. 

That's my gut talking, but I think there's a certain amount of logic behind it. 

After 2 weeks, Russia has failed in almost every one of its war aims. Most of the world has united against it, and there's no really effective way of getting around many of the sanctions that we've placed on them. At this point, I believe Russia is running on borrowed time. Their economy is on the verge of being about as relevant as North Korea's.

Well, what are the ways this ends?

1) Putin resigns

2) Putin pulls out of Ukraine, with or without some kind of peace deal involving territorial gains or political assurances regarding NATO/EU.

3) Putin is assassinated/deposed

4) The Ukrainian government collapses and organized resistance ceases

5) The Ukrainian government collapses, and long-term guerrilla warfare continues.

So, let's count out number four. Zelenskyy is probably so popular right now that as long as he's alive, It's likely that a coherent civil government will continue. In addition, if certain dubious sources are to be believed, Putin's own FSB keeps blowing the whistle on assassination operations against Zelenskyy. Barring luck, illness, or catastrophic reversal on the battlefield, the guy is probably going to stay alive.

Number five requires that same catastrophic reversal, and when that happens, this game gets measured in years.

I count number one as probably out. My read on Putin is that he feels that he has a personal Messianic mission to make Russia great again. In addition, Putin comes from a background where he learned a very hard lesson: ""It is political inaction that kills."" Remember, he was a lieutenant colonel in East Germany during the breakup of the USSR. When he saw the Berlin Wall fall (IIRC), he was calling for military support, and he was told ""We can't do anything without Moscow's say so, and they're not saying anything."" Assuming that he places country above self, he won't step down unless he's thinks Russia will be great. Assuming that he places self above country, he won't step down because it might get him killed.

So, numbers two or three are the two most likely ends. Number two I consider to be the frontrunner. Zelenskyy has already expressed his willingness to negotiate regarding NATO and territorial gains for the Russians. Basically, as much as Russia is hurting economically, Ukraine is hurting physically. I think at this point it's a question of will regarding Russian and Ukrainian losses. I don't think Zelenskyy is hard enough to keep going, unless he genuinely believed the alternative was probably his death and the destruction of Ukraine. My point is that I think he's willing to make significant concessions to Putin.

Number three is what a lot of people are hoping for. Here's the issue with this: there doesn't appear to be any leadership around which a coup could be organized. My belief is that Putin has rather effectively neutralized any opposition that could rally coercive force against him. The Russian minister of defense has no real military experience and his background is as a civil engineer. Allowing for parallels with the Chinese, this means that he probably wouldn't get a lot of respect from the military, and they wouldn't follow him. The oligarch types are interested in money. They can buy off a lot of types, but I don't see them as that aggressive. Basically, for number three to happen, we either need a disaffected/patriot fanatic, or an ambitious leader who can rally troops and crowds. There's no evidence that one is in being at this time. Russia has had a hard history with politics. During the Arab spring uprisings, you saw tests of demonstrations among the middle class. You're not seeing anything similar here, and I think that hard history with politics means that people feel that the nail that sticks up is the one that gets hammered down.

In short, I think this ends with a political settlement in favor of Russia within 2 months.",ee4077a8e35f73838d30397356b38a07529d0fa1,True,False,,,,,0,1646934115,,0,{},i04rjcn,False,t3_tb0olp,False,True,t1_i04n80q,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tb0olp/russia_changes_conscription_laws/i04rjcn/,1646934130,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646905315.0,

We'll likely see a resolution to Ukraine sooner rather than later (the Russian military cannot sustain this operation for long periods of time, nor does Moscow seem able to bear the costs of doing so).

&gt; ""They fled into the woods. Sometimes they're marodyory [looters, marauders]. Even according to our interceptions we can determine many are robbing civilian houses and occupying them.""

‚ñ™Ô∏è I will dwell separately on the informational provocation of the Kiev regime with the alleged ‚Äústrike‚Äù by Russian aircraft on Mariupol hospital No. 3 yesterday.

First of all, I note that the Russian Defense Ministry yesterday announced a ""silence regime"" for the safe evacuation of civilians in the city. Russian aviation in the Mariupol area did absolutely no missions of hitting targets on the ground.

‚ñ™Ô∏è The analysis of the statements of representatives of the Kiev nationalist regime, photographic materials from the hospital, leaves no doubt. The alleged ‚Äúairstrike‚Äù that took place is a completely orchestrated provocation to maintain anti-Russian excitement among Western audiences.

Medical institutions in Mariupol, including Hospital No. 3, stopped their full-time work at the end of February. All staff and patients dispersed by the nationalists. The hospital building, due to its favorable tactical location close to the city center, was converted into a stronghold of the Azov National Battalion. This is massively reported by residents of the city, who moved both to the controlled Kyiv and areas controlled by the Donetsk People's Republic.

‚ñ™Ô∏èPhotographs of the hospital grounds contain evidence of two separate staged explosions near the hospital. Buried underground and another small power directed to the hospital building.

The nature of the external and internal damage to the building can mislead the mass non-professional audience in Europe and the USA, for which this production was made, but not the experts.

A high-explosive aviation ammunition, even of a lower power, simply would not have left anything from the outer walls of the building.

‚ñ™Ô∏è All these and other war crimes in Mariupol are committed by punishers locked in the city. We have repeatedly warned that as the ring shrinks, the number of Nazi provocations will increase. There is nowhere for them to run.

The Nazis of the Azov Battalion deliberately and with particular cruelty destroyed the civilian population in the Donetsk and Luhansk republics for eight years.
    
‚ñ™Ô∏è In recent days, mercenary attacks on Russian doctors and medical special vehicles have become more frequent. The Nazis deliberately ambush ambulances marked with a red cross.

Sniper fire is being fired at medics evacuating wounded Russian servicemen in combat areas and medics providing assistance to local residents in settlements.

‚ñ™Ô∏è All this once again confirms the Nazi essence of the Kiev regime, which publicly calls for the killing of any Russians without exception, in",387ac5b303d8500f21070c889d13205c359037a8,True,False,,,,,0,1646930912,,0,{},i04j5tz,False,t3_tb199v,False,True,t1_i04ii8z,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tb199v/ukraine_megathread_march_10/i04j5tz/,1646930926,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646902112.0,

It's worth noting Ukraine and Belarus were in the exact same position in 1991, and Ukraine could have just as easily gone down the authoritarian path that we see in Belarus, and I don't think anyone thinks it would have been better to see Belarus and Kazakhstan also nuclear armed.

In 1991, the weapons weren't a deterrent (they could only target the far east.  In order to reconfigure them, Ukraine would need to start a nuclear weapons program in the midst of economic collapse, which would also have trigger sanctions, deepening the crisis. There was no money, and no real path forward to make these weapons useful before their service life expired (again without an extant nuclear weapons program) and, keeping it's arsenal (which is could not use), might have triggered Russian military intervention sooner than later, as Russia may not have seen that as a tenable position, from an IR perspective.

While it‚Äôs not been a main event highlighted in most content we‚Äôve seen, UA SOF has very sophisticated systems (many utilize GPNVGs similar to US and other NATO SOF). As a whole, night operations do not seem to be a large portion of the fighting, however I imagine that mush of the images seem are a direct result of that.

Flooding the Ukrainian military with Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), both small commercial systems and larger, strike capable, systems is obviously a huge boost in capabilities. Russia had claimed to have started modernizing their systems to incorporate UAS very early on, so far, this has not materialized. Ukraine adopting such systems allows normal citizens to act as ISR asserts and forward observers.

Small, quick vehicles. Systems like the Polaris MRAZR, heavily utilized by US/NATO SOF would be instrumental in allowing quick mobility across the battlespace. This would be critical for UA SOF attacking the rear support units of the Russian advance. 

I won‚Äôt speculate on what has probably already been done, but I have no doubt that Ukraine has been preparing its forces for asymmetric warfare and the probability of needing stay behind echelons in some locations. However, Russia cannot stay indefinitely. They are incredibly exposed inside an extremely non-permissive environments. Their ability to sustain their forces relies on mobility, so the anti-armor systems flooding the country currently fit the bill.

It's performance was significantly improved. And more improvements have been done since that war.

Generally speaking, the IDF ground forces' training and fire capabilities were greatly improved, as was coordination with the air force. 

The war also exposed the most critical flaw, the neglect of the reserve forces. Back then Israel tossed reservists who hadn't trained for years into combat, often poorly equipped to the point where they had to buy their own equipment and take canteens from enemy dead. That war caused an overhaul in the policy towards reserve forces. The units were cut in terms of personnel, while training for reserve soldiers greatly increased.

The 2006 war also helped push forward the Namer APC program (which had already existed before), and after the 2014 war proved that the M113 is a deathtrap, it further bolstered the IDF's determination to bring the Namer forward as a replacement and helped push the development of the Eitan AFV.

Your argument is a bit too simplistic and deterministic. Why hasn't Russia already nuked Ukraine if all that holds them back is retaliation ?  Ukraine has no nukes to retaliate with. The US is not at war with Russia and the same arguments apply to US nukes.

The reality is that there is bit of nuclear taboo, chances of condemnation (which won't bear much weight given Russia has already been sanctioned out the wazoo), other factors (having to make peace with Ukraine, who are very similar slavic peoples), fear of other transgressions in future. Uncertainty factor of retaliation - whether proportionate or disproportionate and of escalation.

I;ve been arguing for 3 comments that there is an uncertainty factor and risk of being unable to control response and escalation spiral.

A lot of fun has been poked at him for his use of giant tables and big spaces in his official meetings.  This and other isolating behavior has been tied to Covid.

Russia's Sputnik Covid vaccine has been seen as one of the less effective drugs, but it also seems likely that Putin could and would have been able to get ahold of Western mRNA vaccines which would have greatly reduced infection risk and thus reduced the need for extreme social distancing.  But these might not have been options if he was immunocompromised.

We won't know the truth until after the war is over, but the key points I've been able to put together are that they were ambushed by Ukrainian Spetznas while trying to escape the airfield, there are reports they were broadcasting in the open which would give away their position and situation, and the Ukrainians attacked the airfield *immediately* after one of their Buk launchers got hit by VDV.  The official reports is that survivors fled into the woods.

So there are two locations for a potential ambush: the buildings west of the airfield, which is the most likely as a kilometer west is a large wooded area people could actually disappear into. The smaller egress gets them caught against the Dnipro, but that larger woodland offers them a real option of escape. The huge area west of the airfield could have been set up to allow a gap for escape. 

Vul. Kotovs πkoho, a road, in Blystavytsya, west of the airfield, looks like a prime place to leave if it's under attack from the east. Plenty of cover and you could move in a straight line directly to a large wooded area you can evade in.

Making it look like the airfield is about to be encircled but that this route is still open wouldn't be difficult, and would allow you to set up an ambush.

So if the reports from the Ukrainians on what happened are true, that's the most likely location for it to have happened.

Now, they could be lying. Fog of war and all that.

There is a larger set of norms that ""we"" do any have abide by, the norms which the UN rules are supposed to be based on, which we h ave largely adhered to, or at least attempted to do so, prior to any interventions. Russia, on the other hand, has simply lied and ignored those rules, and has acted entirely based on their own great power ambitions. The two sets of actions are not comparable.

""We don't have a good answer to that"" is the exact same sort of statement, coming from the same place, as Trump marveling at Putin's ""genius"" when Putin justified his war by first recognizing the two regions as independent republics and then going in to ""defend"" them (and other Ukranians) against nazi's and genoicide. Trump, being a pathologic liar, and apparently you, are willing to overlook the blatant dishonesty of these statements compared to the facts on the ground, and are thus willing to equate these false claims to the various actions ""we"" have taken when there were actually dictators committing genocide, and other similar justifications. 

The reality is that the ""good answer"" to Russia's justifications is that they are lying about the facts on the ground, wholly, completely, and blatantly. The bad, Russian propaganda answer, is to ignore the facts and only compare the stated justifications, and decide that since the statements released by the countries give the same reasons, the Russian aggression cannot be contradicted.

Additionally, ""going to war with Russia"" is not what the article says we should have done. The issue is that Russia's aggression was allowed to go essentially unchallenged, and Russia was allowed to retain the benefit of that aggression. There are a wide range of possible actions that do not include actual direct combat, and even direct combat does not necessarily equate to ""going to war with Russia"" when it happens between troops of two nations in a third-party country where both are intervening; such things are commonplace throughout history under the old rules of international behavior that Russia is insisting are still in place.

When an RPG hits statistical armor and detonates like you think it should that detonation causes _more_ damage than if that armor was not there. The article I shared works an example showing 20% more damage. Statistical armor _only_ works as it should when it prevents RPG detonation.

To justify your wrong belief you found a passage and quoted it out of context. Here is your quote with more context with relevant passages emphasized:

Forward attacking modern ATGM designs mount the warhead quite far back on the missile, such as in the MBDA MMP diagram above, in large part to optimise standoff. This does mean that detonating on or before the statistical armour array is likely to be detrimental to penetration, _however ATGM boast radically higher penetration capabilities than an RPG owing to their much larger dimensions and that most designs are tandem warheads with precursor charges almost as large as most RPG main warheads._

This penetration can be enormous, in excess of 1,200 mm of RHA armour in the latest guises, and _so radically overmatches almost anything it will encounter when it comes to statistical armour_ packages, which are generally placed on the sides and rear of vehicles where the armour is thinnest.

https://www.tanknology.co.uk/post/statistical-armour has a section titled ‚ÄúThings people commonly get wrong‚Äù below is a quote from it. 

BeginQuote

There is one critical myth that is most routinely repeated about statistical armour, which is that its intent is to initiate an RPG on the armour and thus 'nullify the shaped charge jet before it can reach the vehicle'. 

This is completely wrong, despite how widespread its belief is. So pervasive is this myth, it even crops up in official engineering oriented documentation, such as the UK Defence Standard 23-10 Design Guidelines for Ministry of Defence Specialist Vehicles and Plant Equipment which, despite being totally wrong, says:


""Stand off armour or cage armour is designed to withstand an attack from anti-tank rocket propelled grenades (RPG). It functions by placing a rigid barrier around the vehicle which causes the shaped charge warhead, which uses a shaped explosion rather than kinetic energy, to explode at a relatively safe distance. "" Defence Standard 23-10


As explained earlier, the specific method of defeat for statistical armour is to allow an RPG to pass through the holes in the grid and then damage the structure of the warhead, critically damaging its function as a fuze component. The intent of the armour is not, in any capacity, to present a spaced armour layer that initiates an RPG at a distance from the defended vehicle.

The reality of this myth is actually more significant - detonating the warhead on the bars can be at least as bad as if it had hit the defended vehicle and, in some cases, actually a worse result for the defended vehicle.

EndQuote

I just don‚Äôt understand the logic of anyone using nuclear weapons when you can‚Äôt really distinguish the use of nukes from when they are tactical to just full blown apocalypse. US talked about using nukes as well in Vietnam. It‚Äôs just a dumb idea. Too many hours of COD here. 

It escalates the situation to an extent where the US would have to do something, or pretty much every able country on Earth will start building them, and now that it‚Äôs allowed to use them as tactical weapons, they see it not just as a defensive but as an offensive weapon. 

It is literally in no one‚Äôs interest, Russia, China or the US to make anyone think that using nukes in such a manner is permissible. The nuclear states want to keep nukes the way they are - a very exclusive club of countries that can‚Äôt be invaded or seriously threatened by one another. We‚Äôve had nukes since 1945 and ever since the USSR made their own in 1949 the policy has been the same ever since - nukes are for the purpose of ensuring total annihilation at the edge case of total war between superpowers. That edge case is so destructive that no one wants to do it ever. 

This whole ‚ÄúRussia is going to use nukes‚Äù take is also coming from the idea that Russia is somehow losing this war. They are not, the southern advance by itself is doing very very well, and virtually all major Ukrainian cities outside of Lviv are encircled or almost so.

While a nuke is a nuke , the target, and the launch mechanism differentiate between strategic and tactical

A 0.3t bomb delivered by a F35 against a tank regiment or a naval carrier/cruiser is a very different proposition from a 1.x Mt warheads flying from SLBM/ICBM against Moscow.

There are also plenty of people in the US who do not believe the ""nuke is a nuke"" argument (eg  arguing for  prompt global strike,' 'tactical' warheads etc).

This isn't the red army of 1941. They took greater casualties because the attacker always does, and they were on the attack pushing the Germans out.

The whole human wave myth is a misunderstanding of soviet deep battle theory. 

The Soviets preferred shock troops armed with PPSH machine guns. Their tactics were recon-in-force followed by a full attack. They'd send light infantry and light tanks forward to engage German positions, usually from cover. Once they'd mapped out all the German positions, they'd retreat, and then the heavy infantry and shock troops would move in, supported by tanks.

It seemed to the Germans like it was human wave tactics. In their minds, they fought off an attack in the morning, only to get slammed with artillery and then overrun by infantry and tanks. But those infantry and tanks were able to overrun them with aggressive attacks because their positions had all been noted.

In the case of Ukraine, their military knows this tactic because they were part of the red army, and they've been trained by NATO who designed theory to defeat those tactics. 

So they've engaged in a fighting retreat which pulls Russians into pre-prepared ambushes. They're having a bad time. As the Russians advance they've got to assume that every road is mined, every copse of trees hosts javelins, and behind every blade of grass sits a rifle barrel. The Ukrainians have rapid response divisions of infantry equipped to kill tanks and helicopters.

Ghostomel is indicative of this. The Ukrainians moved mobile SAM launchers into position in order to take out the Russian invasion force in the air. When the VDV realized this, and killed one of the SAM launchers, the rapid response groups moved in and took the airport. As the VDV started running low on ammo, they retreated along the only path that seemed open to them. What I've read says they ran smack into Ukrainian SOF who'd prepared an ambush in that spot, and who had plenty of ammo, and were more than happy to share some with the VDV.

We see this over and over again. The Ukrainians retreat into fatal funnels and wreck Russian columns. 

Even if the Russians were using the recon in force tactic - they're not, they just don't have the personnel to carry that out - the Ukrainians are making sure there's no one left alive to report their positions, and they're highly mobile.",2cf8c1c7ebbcda458836285f41ce00a1875ce6b3,True,False,,,,,0,1646888728,,0,{},i02kr0l,False,t3_ta6y4o,False,True,t1_i027o78,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ta6y4o/ukraine_megathread_march_9/i02kr0l/,1646888741,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646859928.0,

Like many of you, I have read a lot of articles out about the war in Ukraine. Many are uninteresting, unnecessarily long and add little to my understanding. But this one was direct with supporting points in support. Some good quotes from a short article.  

&gt; ""Putin‚Äôs madness tactics"" can be also traced back to the 1999 Kosovo events, specifically to the Pristina incident. That was the first time after the Cold war that the Kremlin used simple tactics to put troops on the ground, then watched the West (or NATO) retreat and accept the situation. Russia repeated the trick in Georgia 2008, in Ukraine 2014, in Syria 2015, and now in Ukraine. Thus Putin is neither mad nor irrational but rather draws on past experiences to guide his actions. The Russian leadership has learned its lessons and is doing now what it was previously allowed to do.

&gt; ‚ÄúI remember 2008 quite well.‚Ä¶ This experience showed that it would be difficult, but after a while [the West] would get tired of this situation and would themselves ask to return to the negotiations, because the Russian Federation means more to the world community than Ukraine.‚Äù

&gt; At least two observations support the argument that Putin viewed his actions as a ‚Äúspecial operation.‚Äù First, the Russian army units entered the territory of Ukraine in close marching formations, as if they planned to take territory without meeting any resistance. And second, the attacking Russian army groups that moved toward Kyiv and Kharkiv were followed by Rosgvardia units, the National Guard, equipped with riot police gear to immediately control occupied cities.

&gt; The first days of the Russian invasion showed that the actual state of the Russian army was significantly worse than that promulgated by official Russian propaganda but also worse than many military experts‚Äô assessments. For example, there were reports that some of the Russian tanks sent into Ukraine were older versions from the 1970s and lacked even dynamic armor. Some experts have also suggested that the results of the first days of the Russian invasion revealed high levels of corruption in maintenance chains and even among those involved in the development of new Russian combat vehicles. The actions of the Russian attacking forces in the second week of the war demonstrated huge deficits in everything from logistics to psychological preparedness.",5619b3b16de8a28ac5cd3b65e96f0aa0ef6c562b,True,False,,,,,0,1646881612,,0,{},i027074,True,t3_taoug6,False,True,t3_taoug6,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/taoug6/putins_miscalculations_by_borys_kormych_of_the/i027074/,1646881624,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646852812.0,

&gt;  
&gt;People really don't get that Russia takes its perceived spheres of influence very seriously.

Your argument contradicts itself. If the idea of NATO forward basing as a casus belli is bullshit then why does Russia take its perceived spheres of influence so seriously? It wouldn't if it thought NATO was harmless to such a concept, yet here we are. 

It's important to recognise that Russian forces' previous military interventions this century, in Georgia and Ukraine, occurred only once it became clear that these countries were irrevocably set on increasing their co-operation with the West and especially NATO, which as former SSRs with important strategic value was from the Russian perspective complete anathema. 

The Russo-Georgian crisis had essentially been bubbling away for years before war actually broke out, while what occurred in Ukraine throughout the so-called Euromaidan period is well-documented at this point. In both cases, pro-Western governments replaced - or attempted to replace - pro-Russian governments in an effort to move closer to the European Union and eventually, most importantly, NATO. In both cases Russia engaged in destabilising activity in order to sabotage these attempts.

We obviously shouldn't trust the Russian government on everything they say, but I do believe we should take their word for it when they claim that NATO is the reasoning behind their offensive against Ukraine, not just because the military history supports that analysis but also because it's ultimately the only halfway-plausible answer to the flood of questions that assume the shape of something like ""where does Russia see the strategic value in this"".",18d39690cbd0657ed6611fc5441c4c2fba65ba23,True,False,,,,,0,1646878900,,0,{},i0213co,False,t3_ta6y4o,False,True,t1_i00siit,/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ta6y4o/ukraine_megathread_march_9/i0213co/,1646878913,1,False,True,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,r/CredibleDefense,public,,0,[],,1646850100.0,

Exactly, the war in Ukraine is not like command and conquer, where the Ukrainian military can't win until it destroys 100% of the Russian units on the map.   


Someone can correct me if I'm wrong but in a regular military unit, once 20-30% of the personnel are dead, wounded, or captured, the unit can no longer function as a unit. Because a real war isn't call of duty, you don't have tens of thousands of 'armies of one' running around, you have companies that trained and fight together and have defined roles and if those roles aren't being fulfilled, you don't have a functional unit anymore.   


Even if the Russian military resorted to 1940's Soviet style human wave tactices, like the commenter you replied to is implying, that would work in the Ukrainian favor with their modern weaponry.   


I don't want to get ahead of myself, I'd hate to see my comment referenced in an aged like milk post, but the Russian, I guess you could call it, expeditionary force might be heading for collapse within a month. As evidenced by Russia requisitioning masses of civilian vehicles, trying to get Syrian mercenaries in, and abandoning thousands of vehicles, they might be effectively scraping the bottom of the barrel already.

They'd have a good point too considering how much fallout would blanket their territory.

Had I come across my comment at the outset of this conflict, or before it for that matter, I would've been very sceptical as well. But with the way the situation has panned out, it's occurred to me that actually it's becoming increasingly likely. Let us not forget at any moment that Putin has deployed unconventional weapons in the past in his pursuit of individuals such as Litvinenko and the Skripals, using Polonium and Novichok respectively. One might think that assassinating individuals is very different to assassinating a city but the difference is merely one of scale; both target sets represent Putin's enemies. Moreover, with how out-of-control the conflict has become, unpredictability of the Human element rises and instability along with it.

As for the specifics of a reaction in Poland's case, I wouldn't say easily exactly. Yes they could regard a nuclear strike against Lvov as requiring an Article V intervention, due in large part to radioactive fallout as you rightly pointed out, but I suspect not quite everyone in the alliance would see it that way, in the sense that governments in, for example, Hungary, Romania and so on would not actively argue for a sustained conventional (or otherwise) response for fear that their country really would be struck next.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Russia only nukes Lviv if Putin wants to murder-suicide the whole planet

Is that what he wants? Is he willing to sacrifice Russia if it means destroying NATO? Alas, we don't know, we don't have the facts as they exist in his mind.

I guess that‚Äôs an angle. But his minimum terms would likely be a land grab in Eastern Ukraine and a promise not to join NATO/EU. 

Regarding the first: Donbas and Crimea are given, and I think that Ukraine might even agree to these terms now if Russia set this as the sole condition for withdrawal. Chemical weapon terrorism for the sake of just Crimea/Donbas seems pointless if these terms are already basically favorable for Ukraine as it is. 

But the lack of a land bridge to Crimea is problematic for Russia, most notably due to water supply issues. So this would likely be the point of negotiation/contention, and maybe what Putin is hoping to coerce via terrorism.

It's being sold to the Russian Public as the latest in the 'justification carousel' (terminology taken from translated Russian forums). It also offers at least part of an excuse to normalize relations towards Russia from non western aligned nations post war with less souring of relations between second and third parties.

It's using a fabricated justification sure, which likely won't be believed by much more than a subset of Russians at best, but that doesn't matter as evidenced by the USA's successful use of this line of reasoning and process.

It's essentially fair play now courtesy of the USA barring admission recent past actions were not actually justified. Dirty, sure, yet it's OK from a realpolitik standpoint for nuclear powers to preempt real or imagined WMDs. No one has to truly believe it beyond enough of the domestic public. 

This is a no loss thing to toss out for the Kremlin. Pretend WMDs work even when no one believes it. What is gained by using it as justification for nuclear attack vs using it as war justification domestically and a partial scapegoat internationally to look past Russian actions (again, Iraq precident). Huge risk, little gain, massive short and mid term ramifications vs a safe play that could give the Kremlin it's answer to it's current attempts to find what actually sticks with their public as justification after the liberation angle fell so hard.
