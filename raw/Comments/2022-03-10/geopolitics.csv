If NATO gets involved and the conflict escalates, holding onto power will very quickly become a much lesser concern than nuclear war.

There are two important questions here. The first question is  what the effects be on food security in Central Asia will be. The sanctions on Russia [were already going to cause harm to these states.](https://blogs.worldbank.org/peoplemove/russia-ukraine-conflict-implications-remittance-flows-ukraine-and-central-asia) I can't imagine this will help stability in this region, and it'll likely be Russia or China who'll end up having to deal with any messes made.

Also, the Baltic States were never Russian. They even enjoyed special status in the Soviet Union and lacked the deep ties held between Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. 

I would be prepared to bet, that if the situation was flipped between Belarus and Ukraine, we'd see the exact same reaction from the Russians. 

So the two key factors are: Russian capability to intervene, and how centrally the country figures into the Russian strategic/cultural sphere. 

If Russia was far far far stronger, they probably *would* have escalated over the Baltic States.

It will take YEARS before this kind of gas supply can be sourced elsewhere without catastrophic supply-chain shocks and the like. Some commentators have stated 4-5 years, others longer.

Truth be told, the fears about escalation ignore the reality of Putin being more scared of our weapons than we are of his. Sure, his nuclear weapons will make us just as dead as ours will him. The difference is that he is worth $200-$300 billion, has a $1.4 billion dollar house, a $140 million boat, a $4.7 million seaside cottage, more women that he can count, and a myriad of life’s other pleasures, and neither you nor I can match.

Yeah, I absolutely agree with you, and that's why I don't see it happening.

There is a delicate dance going on right now. Are economic sanctions an act of war like Putin says? Depends who you ask, but Putin can't justify responding with nukes. Is supplying arms to Ukraine an act of aggression against Russia? Realistically yes, at least while they are actively fighting a war with Russia, but can Putin justify responding with nukes? Not really.

When you get into actually sending NATO planes into an active war zone where Russian troops are operating, and try to tell Putin he's not allowed to use his airforce...then, you are getting into territory where the risk of nuclear retaliation becomes too high.

The real question is not whether actions or offensive or defensive, it's exactly what you pointed out: how much can you help Ukraine without risking nuclear war with Russia? As much as NATO would love to help out Ukraine, they need to walk that line carefully and a NFZ is just too risky from that perspective.",61fc97320995b66725beef22f6bccd0039c5d72f,True,False,,,,,0,1646950414,,0,{},i05x5tx,False,t3_tavpto,False,True,t1_i05b7hi,/r/geopolitics/comments/tavpto/why_did_russia_not_escalate_when_latvia_lithuania/i05x5tx/,1646950429,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646921614.0,

1. The 'routes' in the Korean War you are referring to included unsustainable levels of losses for the PLA &amp; relied almost entirely on sheer weight of numbers to overwhelm unprepared UN positions. This isn't an option for expeditionary warfare.

2. Despite many of the front line units fielding improved domestic designs, much of the PLA's equipment is still based on Russian designs. While this is changing, the new Chinese designs are yet unproven. There's no real way to evaluate their effectiveness in combat yet.

3. The PLAAF's 'large stealth fighter force' is still less than 20% that of the US stealth fighter force and while both are growing, the PLAAF is not expected to field similar number to the USAF, USN &amp; USMC combined. This also does not mention quality. Most estimates pit the J-20 in the same RCS category as the F-18 or Eurofighter, not on par with the F-35, which itself isn't on par with the F-22.

4. Your political analysis is way off. Saying Taiwan needs China as a market is fair. But believing that Taiwan will agree to unification with the PRC is not grounded in public opinion polling which continues to trend against that option. As the older pro-unification population ages out, anti-unification parties and policies are likely to strengthen.

5. On the topic of the original post, yes, lacking combat experience is likely to be a significant factor in any Taiwan contingency operation. Conducting an opposed amphibious landing in contested airspace &amp; seas, and into mountainous and urban terrain, with a hostile population using massive combined arms tactics is probably the single most difficult military operation you can think up. Doing so with little real world military experience in the last 80 years, no expeditionary or amphibious operation experience, and heavy political influence of military decision making seems destined to be monumentally difficult.

Separate nationalism from the situation. If you assume everything you hear from China is fake, their strength is fake, their capabilities are fake, well then whether it is true or not would a governing body responsible for the wellbeing of 30m people want the risk of underestimating their adversary or overestimating? Clearly the latter as what responsible head of states do. Step foot across the strait and see how far these fake things can take a nation; going from an agrarian to a peer competitor of a superpower in one generation is no joke, and doing it with fake things all the more impressive.

Incentives are derived from game theory; and the system compels states to act in ways that are not in their interest. Just as Barack Obama's platform advocated for restraint on foreign policy given the long wars in Iraq, he could not help himself but to overthrow Gaddafi, add troops to Afghanistan, and be the president who dropped the most bombs on foreign soil at the time; just to be surpassed by Trump who also advocated for restraint.

So to address your section on why did these minor states place in leaders and change their sentiment to China? The answer if you want to model the situation with IR theories, is that is China is rising. These states would then balancing the situation in response (Look up balance of power theory), and US is obliged to sponsor that.

To put it plainly, as apparently being well read and unconventional may be provacative as it doesn't follow common narratives, applying these models suggest an outcome where SK will face economic attacks from a rising China and military attacks from NK. These would come in the form of policies that block SK goods to the Chinese market, or missle demonstrations from NK to bring SK to the negotiation table. If SK or US continues to ignore and inflame the red lines, these states would be cornered to act aggressively to seek security (Russia/Ukraine as a recent example). 

Then the question is, if I believe this to be the penultimate outcome, would I personally want to avoid that? Yes! I'd hate for people to unnecessarily die or be radicalized to defend the great powers behind the minor powers. China is SK's neighbor, they gotta live with them forever. US is an ocean away and insulated from any attacks on their soil; The product of the Monroe doctrine and marshall plan.

[],False,,RainbowApple,,,[],,,,text,t2_90tdr,False,False,"&gt; I'm not prepared to accept that perception dictates reality in a circumstance like this when the perception in question is driven by Putin's narrative control of Russian state media.

I disagree with this on a number of fronts. To keep it simple, I'll boil it down to this. 

First, in 2008, NATO announces they plan on exploring membership options being offered to Ukraine to Georgia. Russia is enraged by this, they call this a a ""serious threat"". The logical conclusion from this announcement is: Ukraine and Georgia are vital, strategic interests to the US and NATO, right? Clearly they must be, if we're willing to stick our necks out and offer them safety in this defensive umbrella from... who? Russia. Let's keep in mind: there was *zero* perceived threat at this point from Russia. I invite you to find sources that demonstrate a profound and necessary threat that necessitated the including of Ukraine and Georgia into a defensive alliance with the West, pre-Bucharest Declaration. Only *after* this declaration does Russia invade Georgia in 2008. Let's keep this principle in mind as I go through this too: *I do not support invasions*. I would never myself go to bat for Putin and his wars anywhere, and I certainly did not support the Iraq War in 2003 either. 

Second: My argument is resting on a key assumption: great powers will go to great lengths to maintain their regional hegemony. See: the US and Cuba, Imperial Germany, Imperial Japan, etc... With this in mind, I believe it is quite obvious who Ukraine is more important to between the US and Russia. Ukraine shares a massive border with one, and rests thousands of miles away from another. 

Third: Let's be honest and say it like it is, it doesn't matter what Ukraine wants here. They have a very unfortunate geographical position in being nestled immediately next to Russia. This puts them in their sphere. This means, integration with the west is a direct threat to Russia. Let me be very clear here, too. *It does not matter that this is the will of the people, or that Ukraine has ""earned"" its right to be in NATO or the EU. Russia does not want this to happen*. As I said before, great powers will go to great lengths to preserve their influence. 

You said this is about security. I completely agree. So now let me circle back to the original extension of NATO membership to Ukraine and Georgia. If these two countries were so vital to NATO, why are we not defending them now? And no, don't give me the reason that it's because they're not apart of the alliance. If these countries were so vital to NATO and western interests, we would be there, defending them ourselves. Why were we willing to extend article 5 guarantees in the first place, if we can't actually stomach defending them when they need it the most! The answer is obvious. Regardless of - again - what Ukraine and Georgia wanted, the west was simply using them as pawns to further contain Russia. Of course Russia has reacted since so strongly. And now, we all continue to pile on the Russians, once again calling them the aggressors of Europe and the arbiters of our potential future demise, when - in my honest opinion - we've been antagonizing them for decades now. 

I don't support invasions. I don't support violence. I live in Canada, I am so unbelievably sheltered from the prospect of war. But if you're telling me that Russia is wrong to act this way and they are principally at fault, when the United States has been doing the exact same thing for decades (preserving their hegemony), we are the problem.",71327c6fdadab3c8c302237dc36a483566a9a19d,True,False,,,,,0,1646942153,,0,{},i05cce6,False,t3_tavpto,False,True,t1_i057b8n,/r/geopolitics/comments/tavpto/why_did_russia_not_escalate_when_latvia_lithuania/i05cce6/,1646942165,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646913353.0,

Of course that is only if sanctions are united and significant, a few slaps on the wrist by a few select countries is probably not going to affect anything.

The other point ofc is that China doesn't gain any benefit from invading and occupying Taiwan. Unlike Russia and Ukraine where there is legitimate strategic and economic benefits to a Russia aligned Ukraine, Taiwan is of no real strategic importance and has no natural resources of note.

1) The 1939 invasion of Poland did not use a blitzkrieg strategy or blitzkrieg tactics. German High Command was extremely conservative in their planning and didn't want to risk mechanized columns with exposed flanks. The strategy they utilized was very traditional, focused on mass infantry maneuvers with mechanized units supporting them. The WWI German High Command would have used pretty much the same plan. The first true blitzkrieg strategy was used in the Battle of France, and mostly against objections from German High Command.

2) The Polish Army had already lost the war two weeks into the invasion. The majority of its forces were defeated or being enveloped, with remnants hoping to regroup towards Romania for a final stand, but the majority of Polish cities and the Polish population had already been lost. On the 17th though, the USSR invaded, and any hope of a sustained defensive effort (already very small) was dashed.

4) Russia has failed to capture major Ukrainian cities, has failed to defeat major formations of the Ukrainian army, and has failed to prevent other powers from supplying Ukraine.

5) The initial Russian attack consisted of airstrikes, rapid mechanized advances with paratroopers trying to capture key location ahead of the advance. This is classic blitzkrieg. What was not classic blitzkrieg was that Russia only sent one wave of attackers, so when Ukraine was able to stop them and hit their supply lines (the exact weakness that Germany feared with this tactic), the attacks fell apart and were halted with substantial losses for Russia.

[],False,,ornryactor,,,[],,,,text,t2_gicmz,False,True,"&gt; Do you have a single solitary fact to back that up?

Modern Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus all claim the Kievan Rus' as their cultural ancestors. The region was inhabited for centuries (maybe millennia) before the Rus', but there is little remaining cultural trace of those inhabitants.

The Kievan Rus' are generally agreed to have begun around 862 CE, when the Vangarians captured the city of Kyiv (which obviously already existed) and rapidly turned that into the capital of what would become a significant geopolitical player for the next ~400 years.

However, the Rus' are only half of Ukraine's cultural origin story, covering the northwestern half of the modern country. The southeastern half had already been dominated by the Khazars for more than 200 years at that point (starting in ~650 CE), and the Khazars existed next to the Kievan Rus' until nearly 1000 CE. Due to the proximity, there was quite a lot of intermarriage between the Rus' (who were Slavic or Norse) and the Khazars (who were Turkic), both among peasants and royalty/elites. Because of this, even after the Khazars lost their independence when they were conquered by the Kievan Rus', they received autonomy within the Rus' empire and continued to live in the region even as more Rus' moved there. The cultures blended together and evolved as a singular society for the next 1,000 years.

On the other hand, the cultural core of what is now Russia didn't emerge until the mid/late 1200s. Moscow was a small isolated village at the time, buried deep in the forest and populated only because its location on rivers with easy access to the Black Sea and Baltic Sea made it useful as a trading outpost. The area belonged to a principality called the Grand Duchy of Vladimir-Suzdal. In 1263, the duke carved out the Moscow area into a subdivision of its own and gave it to his youngest son, Daniel, to start building it up as a way to solidify control and expand the duchy's influence against the nearby and rapidly-growing Grand Duchy of Lithuania. This growing Moscow of the late 1200s was the beginning component of what is now Russian culture, though other significant components came much later (particularly during the 1500s).

&gt; The Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic was one of the four core constituents of the Soviet Union's founding. 

Yes, against the clearly-demonstrated will of Ukrainians, and to the delight of the Russian Bolsheviks. 

Ukraine being a founding member of the USSR is not evidence that Ukrainians had any interest in being part of it. It was done at *literal* gunpoint.

Ukraine had also been part of the Russian Empire against the will of the Ukrainian people, and when the Bolshevik Revolutions overthrew the Tsar, Ukrainians jumped at the chance to declare themselves independent. That independent Ukrainian state managed to do just fine until the Russian civil war (which had been continuing the whole time) spilled into their laps. 

The Russian Bolsheviks backed a minority faction in eastern Ukraine who wanted to rejoin Russian control. (Sound familiar?) With Russian help, that faction formed tone-deaf breakaway governments despite outrage from the local population, and fought a war against the Ukrainian government. (Sound familiar?) Facing an enemy alliance that outnumbered and outgunned them, the Ukrainian government pushed Europe to help. (Sound familiar?) They did get help, but unfortunately it came from the Central Powers fighting World War 1. That support lasted about as long as the war did, but once the Central Powers were defeated, their support for the Ukrainian government ended. That allowed the Russian-backed uprising to win the war, seize control of power, and push Ukraine into the USSR.

&gt; Korenization saw the growth of Ukrainian within the Ukrainian SSR

Yes... for 10 years at the beginning of the USSR. Then the Holodomor was committed on Ukraine, killing millions and millions of Ukrainians. By the time it was over, Lenin had changed his mind on korenization (nativization) and reversed course, implementing stronger and stronger Russification efforts over the next ~15 years. By 1950, Russification was in full swing and non-Russian ethnicities were having their cultures wiped out, their languages made illegal, and often their peoples being forcibly deported to some hinterland.",6076f3b03304a7009d980cd2c80b0db3e11b2454,True,False,,,,,0,1646941739,,0,{},i05bam1,False,t3_tavpto,False,True,t1_i04q8ja,/r/geopolitics/comments/tavpto/why_did_russia_not_escalate_when_latvia_lithuania/i05bam1/,1646941750,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646912939.0,

Not eventually, now. China already puts out more tonnage than the US. Now it's less impressive, when we remember that US already has a massive navy and thus cannot and should not be putting out more than China.

The fact remains, however, that China is catching up on the tonnage part. Large destroyers, LHD, LPD, and carriers.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;China is much more powerful than Russia

China's navy has ""AEGIS"" destroyers, AIP subs, LPDs and LHDs, and this year, CATOBAR carriers. Chinese air force has more and more variety of special mission air crafts, more modern bombers, 5th gen fighters in mass production, AESA radars on its 4th gen fighters. 

From what I can gather, China is disappointed in the Su-27 line of fighters, as the J-10's ability in aerial combat to win even with inferior radars than the J-16 is a surprise. 

I'll admit, Chinese online military watchers had a high opinion of Russian army, but looking at the current Russian army in Ukraine, it is old. China's Brigade Combat Teams are all built in the last 10 years or so, with some older artillery. China is updating its infantry soldiers equipment to western standards as we speak. 

&gt;Waiting for a China friendly KMT government.

That might have been a dream at one point, but now. Not so much. 

&gt;US allies won't intervene.

China isn't building its navy to intimidate Taiwan. What it has now is enough. It's clearly meant for someone that actually has a powerful navy.

&gt;Experience overrated.

No it isn't. But unless you are volunteering to die first for PLA, then I guess China just isn't going to have experience. 

&gt;It will be like Crimea, short and easy with few casualties. It will be clinical and textbook.

Who said it would be like Crimea? It's a completely different scenario. Also, if that's what China expected, why did it still order an additional 20 052Ds and 8 more 055s.

Well, unless you consider *why* they don't see it that way.

I'm not prepared to accept that perception dictates reality in a circumstance like this when the perception in question is driven by Putin's narrative control of Russian state media.

There was a time when NATO and Russia were allies under the Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security. Cooperation between NATO and Russia ended with the annex of Crimea.

You don't get to use government propaganda to create a foreign boogeyman, and then justify invading foreign nations on the basis of the perception you built.

&gt;Another point, do I blame Russia for responding? No. Why? Because the United States would and has done the exact same thing. Cuba and Iraq are the most obvious examples.

First of all, two wrongs don't make a right.

Second of all, if Russia wanted to economically sanction the Ukraine, the way that the US has with Cuba, they can go for it. That is a very far way from shelling children's hospitals.

Iraq isn't really the same sort of situation. It is obviously very much not in the US' neighbourhood. Nevertheless, the US did invade Iraq, and I disagreed with that war. But, when the conflict was over, they left, and didn't incorporate parts of Iraq into the US. Is Putin planning to return Crimea, Donbas or Luhansk?

&gt;Why are NATO and the US so eager to be eyeball to eyeball with Russia here? Why couldn’t they have left Ukraine as a “buffer zone” between them. Let Ukraine make trade deals with both countries and leverage that position.

This is the perspective issue: you seem to be totally ignoring what Ukraine wants, and accepting that Russia's concerns should override Ukraine's concerns.

Does Ukraine want to be a ""buffer zone""? No, they have very clearly wanted to join NATO and the EU for years. This isn't something that was started by NATO, it was started by Ukraine, who were in position to be NATO members until Putin's puppet Yanukovych scuttled it. Ukrainians rose up and booted him from office because of that.

The Ukrainians elected Zelensky, who has never been shy about his aspirations for closer ties to the West. 

Your perspective seems to be that the big powers should be able to make decisions for smaller countries. Ukraine doesn't get a vote about their own future because they happen to be next to a larger, more powerful nation?

If NATO were trying to forcibly annex Ukraine, then yeah, they would be in the wrong. If Ukraine really wanted to be a neutral nation, like Finland, they could go for it. NATO hasn't done anything to stop Finland and Sweden from being neutral. That's not what Ukraine wants, though, and they have been pretty clear about that.

Also, just to be clear, NATO countries are more than welcome to trade with Russia, and do so pretty extensively. If they weren't, then the current NATO sanctions wouldn't mean a whole lot.

This isn't about trade, it's about security. The question is: does Ukraine have the right to choose its own path? Or does a foreign government get to decide their fate?

Ironically, this is a bed that Putin made for himself. Back in the day, after the fall of the Soviet Union, Ukraine voluntarily gave up its nuclear arsenal (which they obtained during soviet times) on the basis of security guarantees from Russia.

They were a neutral buffer zone, and there was a pretty solid divide between the pro-Russian east of the country and the pro-EU West of the country. Then, of course, Putin decided to go and take Crimea.

Taking Crimea showed the Ukrainian public that those security guarantees from Russia weren't worth a whole lot, and demonstrated exactly why they needed protection from outside.

Even worse for Putin, he took a pro-Russian part of the Ukraine, tilting the electoral balance in the country even farther towards the pro-EU West, and basically ensuring that the electoral math would favour pro-Western candidates.

Putin really did make his own bed in this case.",961f7c07c1f4286b1ade485f76e4a6cae64f14a1,True,False,,,,,0,1646940160,,0,{},i057b8n,False,t3_tavpto,False,True,t1_i04tex2,/r/geopolitics/comments/tavpto/why_did_russia_not_escalate_when_latvia_lithuania/i057b8n/,1646940176,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646911360.0,

Russia has made the argument that it has assertively in its “near abroad” to protect the interests of ethnic Russians in the breakaway republics. Well it is currently slaughtering them en masse in the eastern parts of its Ukraine. It has argued that it needs to seek economic integration with its neighbours and the West is trying to cut those away. Well now Russia has self-inflicted an economic would on itself far worse than anything America could have inflicted unilaterally as is now functionally on the way to a North Korean-style autarkic regime. It has argued that America and NATO represent an existential threat to its country and that it needs to stop the eastward expansion of its old Cold War rival by any means short of war. Well now it’s bogged down in its own version of Vietnam and NATO has received the biggest propaganda benefit in the history of its existence while previously weak country like Germany are boosting their military spending and decisively aligning with the alliance.

It is thus clear that none of these factors actually motivated Russia or at least its current regime. Instead Putin seeks absolute unilateral hegemony over Ukraine and possible even further abroad than that. In which case aligning with those ostensible interests I previously mentioned  would not have appeased Putin whatsoever and indeed would have made it easier to effect a complete annexation or at least ‘puppetisiation’ further down the line.

In /r/Indonesia they actually [had a person from the defense industry (verified) talk about the Indonesian military,](https://www.reddit.com/r/indonesia/comments/b80pm6/iama_i_work_in_the_indonesian_defense_industry/)

It's embarrassing a forum that thinks of itself as one for serious discussion has lower standards than one that is filled with memes.

How difficult is it to get a retired PLA officer living in Fresno, California to spill the beans?

What I find when talking about the Chinese military is people here focus on the order of battle and specifications.  Not stuff like logistics, doctrine, urban combat, jungle warfare, political / information warfare, infiltration, and [cooperation between the two militaries.](https://www.csis.org/analysis/assessing-chinese-russian-military-exercises-past-progress-and-future-trends) Why? Because they don't know or care, and more importantly it doesn't involve fancy equipment and is nitty-gritty.   I guess the Chinese wasted all that time training with the Russians.

Before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, people would use Crimea as an example of what the PRC military is capable of in Taiwan. Now they dismiss the Russian military and say China is different.

[],False,,LemmingPractice,,,[],,,,text,t2_1hfhp15q,False,False,"&gt;NATO expansion has occurred regardless of Russia's actions. NATO's two biggest post cold war expansions happen when Russia was arguably at the apex of it's relations with the West.

Sure, but cooling Russian relations with the West doesn't mean that countries in Eastern Europe were ready to trust the country who had dominated them for decades.

If I remember correctly, I think Poland and/or the Baltic states were applying for NATO membership at the same time Russia was being considered for membership, so those admissions can't even really be considered hostile actions towards Russia.

Russia decided not to join, because NATO was seen as being founded as an anti-Russian alliance...which, of course, it was, and instead pursued the Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security, for an alliance with NATO. Cooperation between Russia and NATO continued until Russia annexed Crimea, so I feel like the thaw in relations there was pretty much entirely Putin's fault.

&gt;And you act as if American outreach is almost benevolent. This is far from the case as it is entirely self-serving which to be fair is the same with most countries actions in geopolitics.

Like I mentioned, it's certainly not entirely benevolent, but, as you allude to, international relationship never are.

I think you need to view geopolitical actions in the context of the historical norms. In a vacuum, US outreach isn't entirely benevolent, but when you compare it to historical empires like the Russians themselves, Ottomans, Romans, British, Spanish, Portuguese, etc, the US look pretty damn benevolent. 

&gt;Finally soft power is still power friend. Who needs to park a battleship along a country's coastline when sanctioning them works just as well to get your way?

Sure, I don't disagree. I still don't see the problem with this.

Certainly, a cold war, using economic means, seems like a much preferable approach than hot wars.

So far, NATO has said they won't go in to implement a no-fly zone, but I don't think for a second it would be a problem with the organization's defensive nature if they did.

They would be implementing a no-fly zone at the invitation (ie. desperate pleading) of the country who holds sovereignty over that airspace.

Let's also be honest here, implementing the no-fly zone would be defending the sovereign airspace of a country who is currently being attacked specifically for pursuing NATO membership. 

NATO hasn't done it, because any collective action outside of the territory of current member states requires unanimous consent, and that isn't in place, but if they chose to take it I don't remotely see it as an offensive action.

This isn't like the invasions of Iraq or Afghanistan (which were US operations that NATO didn't participate in specifically because they were offensive actions, not defensive ones). This is a country's sovereign airspace which is being violated specifically because they were trying to joint NATO.

So a lot of people are speaking Russian on top of their native language, thus making impression that its similar etc. 

My native language is Ukrainian btw. I grew up speaking Ukr at home and in the school classes but we were speaking Ru outside (in Kyiv), there were instances were even young teens spoke Ukr on the street, but many others made fun of them for it. I'm glad that latest changed over the years.

Russian language including grammar etc. started in 3d or 5th class in our schools back then, don't remember exactly. There were also Ru schools around but we had also some pupils from Ru speaking families, who sent them to ukr schools to learn the language.

I can understand polish only barely and only if it's very slowly spoken/written. But unlike Ru, I never learned it.",9f109d108d2676585b48b7efea08d6b2965558cd,True,False,,,,,0,1646935332,,0,{},i04up2v,False,t3_tavpto,False,True,t1_i04oc28,/r/geopolitics/comments/tavpto/why_did_russia_not_escalate_when_latvia_lithuania/i04up2v/,1646935343,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646906532.0,

""How true is the imminent threat to Russia's survival ?""
Well, was the US's survival in threat when missiles were placed in Cuba? Probably, but the issue was the threat itself.  One could argue that Russia already has Americans and/or NATO military installments near their borders on several fronts.  Having Ukraine join NATO would invite military to the Russian border, this understandably is a threat.  I think we would feel the same way.

""Is Russia incapable of living by adapting to conditions ? how much is due to the social/political system ? ""  
I've been to Russia a few times for different reasons but in all alike, I walk away with the conclusion that they are just wired differently than us in the west.  Their history of brutality and suffering just makes them hardened people.  The type of people that kind of want to be left to their ways and not messed with.  If you know any Russians, you know exactly what I'm saying.  We cannot rewire them any more than we have been able to do so in Iraq and Afghanistan.  So perhaps its better to keep them close, rather than making them the enemy all the time.

""worse than US 2003 Iraq invasion, as Hussein was actually pretty nasty to his people""
There are worse people than Hussein.  That does not justify the war we caused and subsequent social and economic disaster we left behind.  All caused under totally false premise.  We know that now after the fact.  I suspect in a few years we will find out exactly how much our State Dept was involved in causing the current conflict as insiders retire and/or decide to speak about the inner workings of our foreign policy during this time.

NATO is essentially an anti-Russian alliance, and always has been, but I think Russia needs to ask themselves why their neighbours are so eager to join.

NATO hasn't expanded by force, they have expanded because all these countries applied to join. Countries like Poland, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia were shamelessly opportunistic...and rightfully so. Most of Central and Eastern Europe has spent generations being unable to advance their standard of living because they have been used as pawns stuck between more powerful neighbours.

The improvement in the quality of life of people living in Poland now vs 30 years ago is immense, all because joining NATO and other western institutions gave them the freedom that comes with having national security. 

People love to dump on the US, but practically every historical empire that has achieved this level of power has done so by exploiting the countries it has power over. The US invests a whole lot of money to maintain the ability to protect countries halfway around the world that have no relevance to the security of the US homeland. Sure, it's not entirely benevolent, and the US gets a lot of benefit from the arrangement, but it is an arrangement that still benefits the member states more than it benefits the US.

The US has security, whether NATO existed or not. It has the world's strongest military by a mile, and its mainland is an ocean away from any country that could even pretend to threaten them. Estonia doesn't have that luxury, and that's why it celebrates the day it joined NATO on the level of a national holiday.

I think the idea that the West (which is basically the US and its allies) is ""shamelessly opportunistic"" ignores the fact that NATO doesn't force anyone to join, and grows its influence by being a good neighbour and providing huge benefits that weaker countries couldn't achieve on their own.

If you want to talk about real opportunism, it's walking troops into a foreign country and annexing part of their territory because it is a strategically important port.

Putin has tried to argue this, but I just don't see how it is credible.

First of all, NATO is not an offence force. It's mandate is purely defensive, and initiating a conflict could even remove the requirement of mutual defence from other NATO members. When the US invaded Iraq or Afghanistan, the vast majority of NATO sat those ones out.

Second, there has been nothing at all to indicate any intention on the part of the west to actually attack Russia itself. The West didn't do so during the Cold War, didn't do so when the USSR fell, etc. And, there hasn't been direct conflict between two nuclear powers since nuclear weapons became a thing.

There is no realistic survival element beyond Putin's propaganda. For Putin this is about power. This is about protecting their oil and gas trade from Ukrainian competition. This is about regaining the sphere of influence of the old empire. This is about Putin trying to lash out and increase Russia's power before the demographic crisis severely weakens the nation's ability to do so.

Russia is the largest country on the planet, with the world's richest reserves of natural resources. They don't *need* their boot on the necks of their neighbours to ""survive"", and they know that. Putin *wants* his boot on the necks of their neighbours because he is power-hungry. End of story.

Nothing about this conflict has anything to do with actual or perceived survival of Russia. If anything, by exposing themselves by committing their military abroad it *risks* the survival of Russia more than it ensures it, because of the massive sanctions that it brought, and because having so much of the military committed outside of Russia increases the risk that independence movements among ethnic minorities in disputed regions will take advantage of the opportunity (eg. Chechnya).",bd2320c8953da70e09a75f63f8f6df67335f2612,True,False,,,,,0,1646932495,,0,{},i04naki,False,t3_tavpto,False,True,t1_i046da2,/r/geopolitics/comments/tavpto/why_did_russia_not_escalate_when_latvia_lithuania/i04naki/,1646932506,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646903695.0,

Russia doesn't *like* that NATO troops are 100 miles from St. Petersburg in the Baltics. But looking at how easy it was for Russia to cross the borders, from the reverse perspective Ukraine was always going to be the bigger problem. And the bigger prize - for strategic importance of its location (assured access to the Black Sea, strategic depth, wheat and resources, etc) and its position in the Russian imperial psyche as an integral part of the Russian world.

For quite some time, Russia was able to use its security services and economic diplomacy (i.e. threats to cut off gas and cross-border economic ties) to cajole Kiev away from west and keep its NATO ambitions in check. And to some extent, the carrot of shared cultural and familial ties. They believed that it was inevitable Ukraine would look eastward, and that once it was they would be able to set their sights on the less mortal issues of the Caucuses, Central Asia, and the Baltics (more or less in that order).

The Russians have been in 5 wars since Putin was put in charge for example, and even invaded Crimea in 2014, which could be said to be a perfect tutorial for invading Ukraine.

By now however, it is clear that they failed to meet any of their military objectives, being now forced to grind away at it in a pyrrhic manner, so even with all the experience they had, and many numerical advantages, they still drastically failed by any objective measure. 

To me what their failure showed is actually that having a strong economy to maintain a strong and adaptive military infrastructure (supply lines are key) that can handle many circumstances on the other hand is what truly matters. Especially as we are entering a new period of military tech revolution, i.e. drones, cyber, social media propaganda warfare.

The many Russian failures seemed a direct consequence of having spent a long time cutting corners, and not maintaining and updating their fleet due to their relatively poor economic situation.

Point is, every war is different, so experience is overrated without at least competent generals that learn from this experience, something that you won't necessarily have. In this case, Russia clearly didn't, who knows about the Chinese generals.

Instead, on a more practical level having a well funded adaptive military infrastructure, and so on is much more valuable than having a 'veteran army' with lots of 'experience'. IF China is as economically powerful as everyone thinks, their military should be funded well (even with a decent level of corruption) before the invasion hence, we can't expect them to fall apart as easily as it happened in the Russian/Ukraine situation.

Also, if a China Taiwan war actually happens any time soon, the war will probably be expected to be short (to minimise social/diplomatical problems), in the same way the Russians probably expected to take Ukraine quickly. In short wars, what matters more is objective calculations and strategy than 'experience'. All plans fail in the long run, but they can be very reliable in the short run - so in their scenario, it'll all depend on how well the Chinese generals calculate all the variables.

Moving across open terrain is something entirely different from taking cities and they are slogging through trying to do the former.

This is not a ""fact"" at all; this is one of Putin's core propaganda claims.

From their own national census, 17% of Ukrainian citizens reported themselves to be ethnically Russian. 73% reported themselves to be ethnically Ukrainian.

Claiming that Ukraine is culturally Russian is saying that ""there is no Ukrainian culture"", which is observably and *objectively* nonsense. Ukrainian culture predates Russian culture by nearly 600 years. By the time the Russian Empire subjected much of what is now Ukraine, the Ukrainian culture was so strong and so un-Russian that the empire spent most of its existence trying to repress it. (That's part of the reason that the Ukrainian and Russian languages have so many differences in vocabulary: Russian absorbed lots of foreign influences from rubbing elbows with the elites and royals in Germany, France, and elsewhere; Ukrainian did not.) Despite the Empire's efforts, Ukrainian culture persisted. When the USSR enslaved Ukraine, it *also* spent over half a century trying to crush Ukrainian culture, with mixed success but failure in the end. If there was no such thing as Ukrainian culture, then Russian slavemasters wouldn't have needed to spend 200+ years trying to eliminate it.

One notable difference is that China's economy is massive compared to Russia's (by some metrics, it has already surpassed USA's).  Especially in general manufacturing, China dwarfs everyone.   Even if the hardware isn't battle tested, they can field far more of it, if they desire.   
 Their economy is also far more influential, and can't be hurt by sanctions the way Russia's has (well, it is not invulnerable, but because of China's influence, those sanctions would hurt the imposers far more than Russia; when's the last time you bought anything made in Russia?).

The Russians can certainly try to shoot them down over Ukraine, because they currently control the airspace.
Aside from propaganda reasons, their justification for doing so doesn't really matter, given that they've already violated international law and several treaties by taking over that air space. War is war.

&gt;Since they already are are at war with Ukraine, they would be destroying Ukranian weapons then, not NATO ones ?

It depends who is flying the aircraft and what markings they display. Polish pilots in Polish MiG-29s means Poland would become involved. This could then trigger Article 5.

If Ukrainian pilots can somehow collect the aircraft from airbases in Poland and fly them back with Ukrainian markings, then it becomes feasible.

Alternatively, Polish pilots could fly them to a secret location (with a working airfield) near Ukraine where they could transfer them to Ukrainian pilots.  

However, the potential risks of doing this must be weighed against the benefits because how much difference will these extra aircraft really make to the Ukrainian war effort? 

The feasibility of the above options and their cost vs benefit could be what NATO is currently discussing.

&gt;It should be problem if they were to destroy those planes 'before' they get into Ukraine

The german military brass aka the leadership isn't much better sadly. As one can imagine, the past defense ministers were ""hesitant"" to solve these problems, so the problems grew with every year.

This lead to billions being wasted on unnecessary or overly expensive equipment or systems, which weren't actually helpful for the armed forces nor useful in a modern day conflict (e.g. Tiger helicopters without traversable guns or the Marder IFV which is way too expensive to be used), or completely unnecessary things, like bases that made no strategic nor training sense kept running, or millions being spend on repairing an officer training sail ship.

Coupled with the past onservative governments obsession with ""financial responsibility"" aka saving money wherever possible, despite the glaring needs for investment, the Bundeswehr has grown a huge backlog of things that are just missing, e.g. ammunition, weapons, warm clothes, vehicles that don't fall apart, etc.

On the other hand, forces in Poland is quite weak. Poland has about 120k active force and they are in need of modernization (they fly Soviet vintage mig 29).  NATO only has a token tripwire force stationed in Poland.  It is true that NATO members have total military strength far larger than Russia, but it is not positioned to block Russian invasion into Poland. 

A recent war game simulating full scale Russian invasion called ‘Winter-20’ showed that Russian army could overrun Warsaw in less than a week. In fact the results were said to be ‘worse than 1939’. Poland has since made a huge commitment to modernize and expand its military. But for now, Poland stands quite vulnerable. 

Furthermore, if you look at the map, Russia can strike airbases within Poland from Kaliningrad.  The moment Poland decides to send Migs to Ukraine, you can bet Russian cruise missiles or ballistic missiles will be flying from Kaliningrad to Polish airbase. 

So of course, Poland is afraid of Russian wrath.  

In the end, Putin will not care what decision process the West went through to give Migs to Ukraine, or how they are transferred. He has already stated that sanctions are akin to act of war, and anyone who interferes with operations in Ukraine will suffer consequences. He will calculate the damage to be caused by Migs vs damage/cost he will suffer as consequence of striking NATO.

""Invasion going slower/more painfully than expected"" =/= ""will lose the war"".

The Russian army having poorer equipment/logistics than anticipated doesn't mean they can't pound the country with its superior artillery and air capabilities until Kyiv agrees to peace terms according to which they formally lose, since the alternative is to have their country become 100x the apocalyptic hellhole it is now. 

In Ukraine: The government's and (most) people's dream, as far as I can tell, was for Ukraine to become over the next decade or two a less corrupt, more 'nice normal EU Eastern Neighbourhood' country on track to membership. You can't have that if you're fighting a permanent Afghan-style insurgency in a country that looks like something out of the Terminator movies. In that sense, Putin wins just by keeping the war going. ""Ukraine doesn't want to be with Russia? Fine. It'll never be an EU country, either.""

In Russia : a) the kind of Russians who support this in the general population are the ones who can tough sanctions out and didn't expect much out of life in the way of McDonalds etc anyway; b) the ones who do will either leave as part of the (accelerated) brain drain diaspora, or else lose hope and get with the grimmer new normal; c) those were the general population. For their equivalents in the elite: group 'a' are the *siloviki* in political/military power, group 'b' are the business oligarchs. As for Putin, I don't really see a future where any of these four groups kicks him out of the Kremlin. Apart from the West, much of the world will be happy to do business as usual with Russia. 

I'm not happy about any of this. I just want someone to point me to a comprehensive, realist explanation as to how Ukraine gets back to any kind of normality and Putin loses.

You overestimate the importance of BRICS. First of all, Russia's biggest economic relationships are with the EU. Secondly, the combined BRICS (and whoever else) economy is nowhere big enough to replace the Western countries, either as a market or as a provider of capital, even if Russia magically, in a flash, replaces all its Western relationships with a BRICS one. Maps and population cartographs are not an accurate representation of economic and political influence. 

Last but not least, no one is going to give any quarter to Russians on the global market, BRICS or no BRICS. The entire world knows that Russia is in a desperate spot, and that dealing with them at the moment might earn the ire of the West.

Ukraine pursued a third option: to join the EU and/or NATO in order to put a stop to Russian pressure (political, economic, covert, and military), with the belief that Russia would be reluctant to escalate.

Once EU and/or NATO membership was achieved, they hoped Russia would step down for fear of military conflict with the West.

Most of the West, meanwhile, also did not believe Putin would choose to escalate to the extent that he did, assuming him to be a rational actor driven by geopolitical and economic concerns rather than someone driven by emotion and revanchist ideology.

Thus, they opened a slow path to EU and/or NATO membership, but without the urgency and commitment that might have allowed those things to act as a deterrent for Russia.

This can only be achieved with the help of a neutral major power which isn't supporting any sides in this conflict (no NATO member) and that is clearly China. The elephant is in the room, sooner or later the West will have to recognize this and the US will not be happy about it.

My only fear is that the US is going to continue to play a dangerous game with Putin and try to bleed him out with sanctions to increase pressure from the inside. But Putin's reaction to inner pressure has mostly been outer aggression, so he needs at least a tie or a way to make it look like a victory that was worth the cost and the power to grant him his wish lies mostly within the hands of the EU, Ukraine and China (which has already been threatened with sanctions by the US which further increases pressure on Russia).",ebbb5e3b2ee7311c983d1fe6ce60a4a92482cef2,True,False,,,,,0,1646872511,,0,{},i01n24q,False,t3_t0cgvt,False,True,t1_hzz0po4,/r/geopolitics/comments/t0cgvt/ukraine_megathread_all_new_posts_go_here_so_long/i01n24q/,1646872528,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646843711.0,

Russia used economic pressure not just to get Yanukovych to abandon signing the Association Agreement, but to get him to integrate Ukraine with the EAEU.

Even if Yanukovych had somehow resisted the second part of that demand, it should be clear that Russia was aiming for more than just neutrality. Which means that with every new Russian-leaning president that might have followed Yanukovych, Russia would have attempted the same thing again.

At some point, it would have succeeded. And after that, any attempts by Ukraine to leave would have resulted in Russian intervention.

Again, Putin made many statements about Ukraine comprising ""historical Russian lands,"" and some of those statements predate Euromaidan by years.

For example, [here's an article from 2008](https://jamestown.org/program/putin-pays-homage-to-ilyin/). Two excerpts:

&gt; *According to Shevkunov, Putin cited Denikin’s suggestion that ""No-one must be allowed to interfere in relations between us, ‘big Russia,’ and ‘little Russia’ -that is Ukraine. This was always a purely Russian affair."" Putin added that Denikin viewed any movement toward disunity between Russia and Ukraine as ""impermissible."" Shevkunov also told the journalists that Putin ""recalled reading Denikin’s memoirs in which the latter said that despite his hostility to Soviet power, even to think about the dismemberment of Russia was a crime …especially when talking about the little Russian land – Ukraine""*

&gt; [...]

&gt; *Putin has always been contemptuous of Ukrainian statehood. In April 2008, Putin was quoted by the Moscow-based Kommersant as telling President George W. Bush: ""Ukraine is not a state. What is Ukraine? Part of its territory is in eastern Europe, and another part – a significant part – was given to it by Russia.""*

Putin has given exactly zero indication of being willing to actually respect Ukrainian as a neutral but sovereign state. Rather, he gave every indication in his words, deeds, and demands that he wanted Russia to effectively control Ukraine.
