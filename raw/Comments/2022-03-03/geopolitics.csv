I suspect Putin &amp; company believed that the current government, overawed at the enormity of being invaded by Russia, would quickly flee the country; that the Ukrainian army would thereafter put up little or no resistance. This would make Putin’s propaganda have an air of reality to it (he characterized the Russian operation as a “special military action” and not, by any means, an “invasion”, designed to free Ukrainians from their oppressive “neo Nazi” government). 

If things had gone to plan, a new Ukrainian government would have been quickly installed, and no doubt would have duly parroted Putin’s claims that the previous government were a bunch of neo-Nazi crooks. That would muddy the waters enough so that the usual ‘useful idiots’ in the West and elsewhere would be able to pass the whole thing off as a sort of necessary police action. 

It wasn’t a crazy plan - only, as is now obvious, it ignored the actual state of Ukraine after eight years of being bullied by Russia. This has led to a considerable rise in nationalist feeling in Ukraine, including among Russian-speakers (it is notable that the current Ukrainian leader’s first language is Russian, and he’s put a lot of effort into overcoming the linguistic-nationalistic divide between Russian and Ukrainian-speakers).

BERLIN, March 3 (Reuters) - Germany is considering supplying 2,700 anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine as it seeks to defend itself against an invasion by Russia, a government source said on Thursday.  
  
German news agency DPA reported earlier that the economy ministry had approved supplying the **Soviet-made Strela missiles**, part of the inventories of the former **German Democratic Republic's army**.  
  
A source told Reuters that the Federal Security Council had yet to approve the move. ""The missiles are ready to be transported,"" the source said.

1) Loss of trust in the dollar. The strength of the dollar is it's use in trade across the globe. Sanctioning and cutting off SWIFT such a major resource exporter will send waves in the ability to trust the reliability of the dollar. If they're willing to do it to Russia over a ""perceived whim"" (remember, the US isn't even directly involved in the conflict), what's to say that other actions that do not meet the US approval won't meet the same date? We've already seen Saudi Arabia starting to make moves to decouple its business from the dollar by doing more business with China.
2) Inflation due to resource scarcity. Keep in mind Russia is a major exporter of energy resources, grains, and fertilizer, among others. Resource scarcity will lead to increasing global prices - we've already seen the oil price skyrocket. As somebody who works in the oil industry, I can say that we're already creating multistage plans to increase gas prices in the US in order to keep up with margins. Food prices will most likely grow as well.

What's confusing to me about this whole sanctioning process is that China gets to benefit the most out of this.

For example the Middle East. It's a large grain importin region. They buy import wheat, rice, and corn.  as long as what they sell (ie oil) goes up it shouldn't be a problem. 

Oil is far more important than wheat for food consumption. Basically, when we eat food today, a good % of our calories is dependent on oil. Oil for pesticides and fertilizer. Modern agriculture is chemically intensive.

You really don't understand how modern agriculture works. Wheat can be substituted for other foods.  But oil used to make agricultural inputs can't.

That is the main reason why for the US, Ukraine isn't important as ME for food supply.

[],False,,Malthus1,,,[],,,,text,t2_130z0h,False,True,"I would say from a geopolitical and military perspective, the invasion had proved a failure, even though it is only a week into it. 

Why? 

Because it is pretty clear from the evidence we already have what Putin’s plan was - a quick decapitation of the current Ukrainian leadership, the installation of a puppet regime, and then a withdrawal - “de-nazification” completed, with Ukraine throughly vassal-ized. 

Only this plan makes sense of the early Russian military moves, such as dropping special forces at key locations around the country, then driving columns deep into Ukrainian territory. 

The plan itself wasn’t totally crazy. Something like it worked for them before - they were able to seize Crimea without much trouble; the West slapped them with some sanctions, but they decided the price was worth it. They simply figured they could do the same again, on a larger scale. The west would be pissed but would get over it, when faced with a *fait accompli*. Maybe some sanctions would remain, as a lingering expression of disapproval (as they have over Crimea), but Russia could live with that. 

It is now clear that this plan has indeed totally failed. The Ukrainian government was not decapitated. The military and political failures on the ground ensured that, despite a lot of initial hesitations, the West imposed much more severe sanctions. It now appears that the invasion has taken on the features of a battle for national survival on the part of the Ukrainians, rather than (say) the mere replacement of one leader for another, in which the population may have little true interest. 

This does not mean the war is over or that Russia has lost it - it just means the Russian plan for the war has failed. They must now pursue a new plan, one that they are not that well suited to - a more grinding conquest of the entire country, city by city, against a committed enemy population. This sort of fighting is very expensive in terms of men, money and morale. 

Russia could (and unless something changes, presumably will) still “win” that war - but the cost is likely to be ruinous, even without the impact of Western sanctions. It is not at all clear that the Russians have so far committed enough troops for a true war of occupation. The Ukrainians can count on lots of economic and material support from the outside world, meaning that the battle could drag on for a long time - while Russia is bleeding money (and men and morale). They may be faced with problems elsewhere. 

In summary, the initial Russian plan appears to have already failed; the new plan open to them is deeply unattractive - even if (or when) they eventually succeed in purely military terms, the political and economic fallout will be much more severe than could reasonably have been expected under their original plan.",02f2b0114cb73da054f19181c7f0220c76d54b7b,True,False,,,,,0,1646333329,,0,{},hz7t4g9,False,t3_t5u0p1,False,True,t1_hz7iw68,/r/geopolitics/comments/t5u0p1/invasions_are_not_contagious_russias_war_in/hz7t4g9/,1646333345,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646304529.0,

&gt;On March 3, Russian President Vladimir Putin held a meeting with permanent members of the Russian Security Council, which was dedicated to the special operation of the Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine.  
  
""On February 24, a special military operation began in Ukraine. Fulfilling the tasks set to protect our people in the Donbas, to ensure the security of our Homeland, Russian soldiers and officers act courageously, like real heroes,"" TASS quotes Putin as saying.  
  
According to the head of state, Russian servicemen ""fight bravely, with a full understanding of the rightness of their cause."" ""Even after being wounded, soldiers and officers remain in the ranks, sacrifice themselves and their lives to save their comrades - in-arms and civilians,"" the President said.  
  
He also added that the special military operation is proceeding strictly in accordance with the schedule and according to the plan, and all the tasks set are being successfully solved.  
  
In addition, Putin made a number of other statements:  
  
The Russian Armed Forces provided corridors for civilians in all places of clashes in Ukraine. But the nationalists do not allow them to leave, also placing heavy weapons in residential areas.;  
Nationalists and foreign mercenaries in Ukraine hide behind civilians as a human shield;  
Families of servicemen killed in the operation in Ukraine will receive more than 7 million rubles, and the wounded — an additional payment of 3 million rubles.;

This isn't whataboutism, I'm just trying to suggest that changing the UN into a more powerful institution won't necessarily always benefit 'your side', and could result in longer term unintended consequences.

Currently as other posters have mentioned it allows from casual dialogue and 'polling' and signalling intent, all valuable things that encourage diplomatic solutions (peer pressure) versus worst case scenarios. Making it more serious could end up causing a lot of fracturing, and it won't necessarily be 'your' side that wins.

No, they are literally part of the govt. When talking about the Lebanese govt, you are also talking about Hezbollah. It's called ""The party of God"", not the ""Militia of God"". 

Hezbollah is first and foremost a Lebanese political party with a paramilitary wing. That paramilitary wing was empowered and is such a strong force today precisely because Israel has on numerous occasions violated Lebanon's sovereignty and territory. 

Israel invaded Lebanon during the Lebanese civil war and organized and participated in the genocide of Palestinians in Lebanon before Hezbollah was a thing. 

It's precisely because of Israel's invasion and occupation of Lebanon in the civil war that Hezbollah exists in the first place.

Now you're contradicting yourself. Is Hezbollah attacking Israel against the govts wishes? or is it just for political show? Make up your mind, you can't have it both ways.

The Lebanese people will never accept Israel until Israel stops its immoral actions and genocide and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people. And it's govt, rightly follows that sentiment. Though I imagine that Israel would prefer a brutal mass murdering dictator if that means they could score PR points on another fake ""peace deal"" just like with Sudan, Egypt, Bahrain, and the UAE.

Israel is evil, because its actions are completely immoral. It's ethnically cleansing Palestinians, that's evil.

No, it hasn't. Anti-Zionist politics is derived from the people's will, not the govts.

That goes both ways. There's a reason why the West never imposed these sanctions over what China did to the Uyghurs. Such sanctions would crash the global economy.

What's not really covered here is how shifts in the international environment change the thinking of the Taiwanese electorate.

Chinese repression in Hong Kong destroyed the campaign of the last KMT candidate for president and changed the way everyone in Taiwan talks about China. It used to be blue, pro-China leaders could be very open about their efforts to further integrate Taiwan with China, but after Hong Kong, KMT had to try to reinvent themselves by looking for younger up and coming legislators who didn't put their pro-China biases front and center, and the party's language as a whole regarding China has changed dramatically.

People never talk about it, but in 1991 Taiwan ratified additional articles to the constitution that changed the language regarding territory to distinguish the islands under ROC control from China, and in 2005 it ratified amendments to the additional articles that allowed for changes in territory via referendum. Essentially Taiwan has been quietly salami slicing its way toward cutting itself off entirely from China and the trend in attitudes among the electorate is clear. Hong Kong accelerated that.

It remains to be seen how the Ukraine situation will play out in the Taiwan electoral landscape, but DPP has never won back to back presidencies, most observers really don't like KMT's chances in 2024, and a very likely DPP candidate is going to be the vice president William Lai, who went to Shanghai in 2014 and urged students at Fudan University to recognize and study the student movement that led to Tiananmen and said to them, in China, that the independence movement in Taiwan will only gather momentum. He is what some consider to be an independence activist who just ten years ago may have been considered unsuitable as a candidate for president.

Now, people might think this has nothing to do with Xi's calculus. But Xi should look at Ukraine and observe how threats of war, belligerence toward others and actual invasion have affected Ukrainian people's attitudes and their friendliness toward Russian rule. And he should understand that there is a calculus in the other direction too that is gauging strengths, weaknesses and geopolitical openings for movement in the direction of genuine security from Chinese threats.",1f9301cecf6167070fd2256c15d0b82ff9903a17,True,False,,,,,0,1646326524,,0,{},hz7b7wr,False,t3_t5u0p1,False,True,t3_t5u0p1,/r/geopolitics/comments/t5u0p1/invasions_are_not_contagious_russias_war_in/hz7b7wr/,1646326543,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646297724.0,

I don't get the impression this was read very carefully. Does it talk about Ukraine? Yes, but it recommends *against* trying to ""drag Russia into a war with Ukraine"", citing the high risk and cost associated with it.

From the **Overview and the Central Argument of the Report**:
&gt; We are not recommending all of these measures, nor any particu-
lar combination thereof. The purpose of this study is not to propose
a policy for dealing with Russia, only to evaluate a range of options
available to the United States should it choose to intensify competition
with that country. 

From the section **Providing Lethal Aid to Ukraine** in Chapter 4
&gt; Conclusion
The option of expanding U.S. military aid to Ukraine has to be evalu-
ated principally on whether doing so could help end the conflict in the
Donbass on acceptable terms rather than simply on costs it imposes on
Moscow. Boosting U.S. aid as part of a broader diplomatic strategy to
advance a settlement might well make sense, but calibrating the level
of assistance to produce the desired effect while avoiding a damaging
counter-escalation would be challenging.

From **Recommendations** in Chapter 4
&gt; Extending Russia through geopolitical competition is a fundamentally
difficult and dangerous proposition. One might bait Russia into extend-
ing its foreign commitments, but only at the risk of serious setbacks to
local U.S. partners. Even if such efforts succeeded in generating Russian
withdrawals, the result would be the opposite of an extension (Table 4.1).

And from the **Implications and Recommendations for the Army** from Chapter 9
&gt; Ultimately, the task of “extending” Russia should not fall primarily to
the U.S. Army or even the U.S. armed forces. Indeed, the most-prom-
ising ways to extend Russia—with the highest benefit, lowest risk,
and greatest likelihood of success—probably fall in the economic and
information domains rather in the military domain. Moreover, as this
study has argued, Russia is not seeking military parity with the United
States and might simply choose not to respond to some U.S. military
actions (e.g., shifts in naval presence), while other U.S. military actions
(e.g., posturing forces closer to Russia) could ultimately prove costlier
to the United States than to Russia. Nonetheless, there are at least three
major implications of this work for the U.S. Army.
First, the Army should rebuild its expertise on all things Russian,
including foreign area officers, linguists, and intelligence analysts. If
Russia does indeed pose a long-term threat, then the U.S. Army needs
to develop the human capital to engage in this strategic competition.
Second, the Army should consider investing—and encourag-
ing the other services to invest—more in the handful of capabili-
ties (e.g., ATACMs, IFPC2, longer-range anti-air defense, and other
systems designed to counter Russian A2AD capabilities) that could
extend Russia. The U.S. Army also might consider spending some of
its R&amp;D resources on less mature, more futuristic systems (e.g., swarm
unmanned aerial vehicles or remote ground vehicles). While these
measures would likely be insufficient in and of themselves to extend
Russia, they would benefit U.S. deterrence efforts and could augment
a broader whole-of-government policy.
Conclusions 277
Third, even if the U.S. Army is not directly involved in “extending
Russia” per se, it will play a key role in mitigating the consequences.
As already mentioned, all the measures to extend Russia incur some
degree of risk. As a result, enhancing U.S. deterrence posture in Europe
and increasing U.S. military capabilities (e.g., an enhanced Javelin or
active protective systems for Army vehicles) might need to go hand-in-
hand with any move to extend Russia as a way of hedging against the
possibility of tensions with Russia escalating into conflict.",54c6e0cfcf6efe99e58c1547c2b08e531203b784,True,False,,,,,0,1646326471,,0,{},hz7b2tk,False,t3_t5shvp,False,True,t3_t5shvp,/r/geopolitics/comments/t5shvp/confirmed_us_imperialists_wanted_to_drag_russia/hz7b2tk/,1646326486,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646297671.0,

Whatever happens in this war the Ukraine won't be allowed to join NATO for example, because to join these major unions, you have to satisfy certain economic/political conditions, and these conditions would take a minimum of probably a decade+ to accomplish for them. Only strong stable nations with a good track record of good management would be allowed into NATO for obvious reasons - a flaky country could cause the start of ww3. Joining the EU is not as strict as NATO, but it's still not that easy.

The UK on the other hand could, but what's the major incentive for it to do so currently?

The UK and EU are trading partners, so as long as the UK continues to be friendly with the EU, in the long run the two will strengthen their trading ties, and in the long run 'idealistically' a lot of the negative trading consequences of brexit will slowly disappear as both sides will aim to optimize for maximum $ on both sides. (arguably this war will benefit the brexit side, as it will encourage european friendship, making the fallout from Brexit be 'forgotton')

Meanwhile, this war could result in a major refugee crisis in the EU, and even though currently the Ukrainian's have all the support, combined with the middle eastern refugee crisis, the EU could undergo a decade of cultural upheaval and 'ideological' infighting over this. Along with a lot of other potential unknown second order affects that aren't obvious yet.

This is probably the biggest issue. Indonesia still has a lot of issue on this aspect due past government making many mistake in decision such as centralized development and selling raw resources instead of processing them to have higher values.

Indonesia needs to develop the infrastructure and invest in other island. A lot of people still prefer to move to Java due to the lack of development in other island. Causing the difference of islands in development to escalate even further

There is also issue of electricity share, a lot of village still use Solar PV instead of being connected to main power grid. As developing country Indonesia needs to make sure to keep up with its energy demand hence why it should still use fossil energy. As comarison. Indonesia EMission per capita is only 2%, while US and Australia has more than 10 %. It is not possible for Indonesia to focus only on renewable energy yet.

I think Indonesia made good decision to limit its export like coal. It should focus to industrilize itself and strenghtening its foundation before starting to be involved in International politic. 

Indonesia first president did mistake by being too patriotic and focusing on politic instead of economy when our base is not strong yet while the second regime is very corrupt and basically a Western Block henchman*(Communist party genocide and Invasion to Timor has support from West Block)*.

NATO has a bit of an Achilles heel: its expansion eastward has caused it to incorporate countries that the US and western europe may not have a strategic interest in defending. 

Understand that no one has really tested article five of the charter. This is why there have been debates in defense rags about the enforceability of article five since the 2000s. These are arguments that have never been in public discourse.  It's abstract talk until it's real. Then what ? I have no doubt the US would defend the western bloc.  But the eastern bloc? I'm not so sure. Article five does not explicitly state force will be used, but the invocation of it heavily implies the use of force. I have a feeling that if Putin took that risk and NATO responded with anything less than force, eastern europe would understand this as an explicit admission that the US will not risk military conflict over the eastern bloc. That really changes the lay of the land.

If this is the madman ploy then we may not be reading this right at all. Putin has made some mistakes, but I'm not sure western media really understands his goal. Truthfully,  I can only guess. Most of us can't understand this because our leadership is restrained by short term considerations. You have to get re-elected - Putin doesn't. He can make moves that have long-term payoffs.

The Russian essentially claim that the Ukrainian forces have been killing citizens of the breakaway republics for years. However genocide doesn't cover the intent to destroy political groups and I haven't seen any evidence than Russians are systematically targeted in Ukraine outside of the breakaway republics, so the idea that Ukraine is trying to destroy its Russian (or Russia-leaning) minority seem unfounded.

* Russia will surely take some losses but considers Ukraine an existential fight. Loses have been priced in and success is rapidly approaching. Ukraine is almost a landlocked country now that Kherson has fallen and their Azov Battalion nearly encircled. 
* The expulsion from SWIFT means that Russian oil will now be sold in Yuan. This dramatically harms the future of the petrodollar and USD's reserve currency status
* Pivot to Asia is dead. The more involved the US becomes in Europe the more likely China will find an opportunity to take Taiwan. For this reason China will not allow the Russian economy to fail. 
* Countries that have not joined sanctions on Russia include China, India, Brazil, Iran.  Each of these are top tier players in their region and represent almost half the world's population. Russia may have just divorced from the Western economy but the decades of prosperity in the 20th century now mean that there a plenty of fish in the sea (not literally, unfortunately) 
* Russia and Ukraine are 30% of global wheat exports. Eygpt is the largest importer of wheat, giving the growing Eastern Block a formidable player in Africa. Other countries that import wheat will continue to do so or face famine. 

If Putin and the Russian economy can limp on long enough for the new Eastern Bloc to reorganise their economies the West, a civilisation predicated on cheap labor, easy capital, and unlimited resources, will find itself in an environment where labor is less global, capital is more scare, resources are limited, and inflation around food and energy are rampant.

I just don't see how in the modern world you can truly compete being isolationist. You can try, but your industries will suffer because they are only competing against themselves. Authoritarian regimes can survive if they pay the piper in the west and give other countries things they cannot provide for themselves. With Russia it has traditionally been gas, oil &amp; industrial chemicals.

However Ukraine is different and could potentially really come under full control of Russia, as its government would be that dead set on having it. But guarding those territories from dissent might be difficult for the Kremlin and the heavier sanctions such a move would imply, might really bring down the Putin government.

In reality what might happen is similar to what you suggest, in that there will be a compromise reached where probably a good portion of eastern Ukraine is seeded to puppets or directly to Russia, with maybe a NATO peace talk summit to determine the fate of Kyiv and western Ukraine, which is extremely uncertain at this point.

Either way the downfall of Russian credibility will reduce them to just a regional power, with potential internal instability and coups. Many of their neighbors are turning either westwards or eastwards at the moment, but any such change remains to be seen.

Personally my scare is not that russians would support Putins war, as much as it is that russians stay passive and not take to the streets. It seems from my limmited understanding of russia that Putin have succeeded in making common man in Moscow indifferent or ill informed about the war and global politics in general.
   
It only takes a very small fraction of a country to form a powerfull army that could touple another country.

Heres a few interviews with some russians, where they mostly say ""we will make it"" as if they are **powerless**, or they say ""we didn't have a choise"" as thats the truth whole truth.

I hadn't heard of this yet. It's usually a long process to gain access to the EU. Still that's quite interesting, I will be following to see if the EU approves and then if they offer expedited membership.

Worth pointing out that joining EU is a defensive move. Georgia wants to protect itself I think, like a porcupine. The EU might require they renounce claims on the disputed areas Russia stole from them as a precondition of membership. (They 100% would have before if they even bothered to consider Georgia for membership. Might be a different story now)

&gt;Second, though global opinion may be turning against Russia at the moment, unless we get rid of putin and his inner cadre we are talking major global instability for the foreseeable future.

I mean, I support the goal, but how do you achieve this? USA can't just drop a bomb on him without starting a nuclear war (also we might have to use nukes to dig him out of a bunker). An internal coup would be great, but we can't just sit around waiting for that to happen. 

&gt;Also putin's belligerence, aggressions and the discord he fomented in the West the last several years has got to be answered. That bill is due and the current Russian domestic situation is probably the best opportunity we will have to collect

I feel the same. Putin's Russia has become a global menace. Same question though, how? I think at a minimum you would need unanimity across all the other nuclear powers, especially China and India. 

&gt;Third, Turkey, for the most part, has closed off the Bosphorus Straits to the Russian and has supplied drones and other arms to Ukraine, amongst other negative rumblings from Erdogan towards putin shows, in my opinion, a willingness from Turkey to act against putin's empire ambitions.

This is all true. However the situation seems a bit more complicated. Their economy is in bad shape right now, 50% inflation last year, and Russian tourism and trade is a big part of that. They also have adjacent military interests in Syria, which connects to a lot of Turkey's worst nightmares (militarized Kurdish state, militarized Islamist state, total anarchy and refugees). [This link gives some interesting context.](https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/.premium-the-biggest-winner-in-ukraine-so-far-turkey-s-erdogan-1.10645588) I'm sure Turkey would love to be the heroic mediator/peacemaker of the hour, and also happy to expand its influence. I just want to point out that given their dual economic and military vulnerability, it's fair to expect a continued cautious approach from them. (They haven't joined on sanctions)

&gt;Though I spent some time in the military, I am by education and trade a scientist and will fully admit that I may have a couple naive notions when it comes to geopolitics. Though I still do not see how it would not be in the West's interest to incite Georgia and Azerbaijan to distract putin away from making sound decisions in Ukraine and domestically.

This has been a valuable discussion for me. This is a good time for normal people and non-experts to discuss world events.

I see a possibility of this conflict spiraling into madness. Looking at the strategic map, I think Putin goofed up bigly. He singlehandedly shattered decades of German pacifism and reminded everyone why NATO deserves to exist. Even if he conquers all of Ukraine (for a time...), the Russian economy will wither and die under sanctions and withdrawal of western investments. 

I guess that makes me lean towards containing the conflict and pushing other nations to confront, isolate, denounce and sanction Russia. I feel that expanding the scope of conflict is unwise. War is being fought around multiple nuclear reactors, in a region that feeds much of Eurasia. No step back, this aggression must be checked. But, we should also be responsible global leaders and minimize suffering once the threat is quarantined.",8e303dd693f5259189091ca6a429e739ad74bf5a,True,False,,,,,0,1646291625,,0,{},hz5lxxj,False,t3_t0cgvt,False,True,t1_hz4n0a2,/r/geopolitics/comments/t0cgvt/ukraine_megathread_all_new_posts_go_here_so_long/hz5lxxj/,1646291642,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646262825.0,

[],False,,Wanghaoping99,,,[],,,,text,t2_t6g13xr,False,False,"Eritrea is a tad of a pariah state as of now (They are officially ranked below North Korea for human rights). The government has been sanctioned by the West for a very long time for human rights abuses, including forcible prolonged conscription and suppression of media expression. These sanctions were lobbied for by the Ethiopian government, which had been fighting an on-and-off proxy war with Eritrea following the disastrous Ethiopian-Eritrean War. Ethiopia had capitalised on the Global War on Terror to gain primacy in the Horn of Africa, exploiting the undiscerning support of America for counter-terrorism by alleging that it's political enemies were supporting terrorism to gain American assistance. Ethiopia's accusations that Eritrea was secretly backing the Somali terror group Al-Shabaab against the Ethiopian-propped Transitional Federal Government also inspired these sanctions.  Djibouti backed up Ethiopia due to their own ongoing border conflict with Eritrea, and since Ethiopian commerce largely flowed through them to reach the international shipping lanes, making Ethiopia a primary customer of Djibouti's port services.

Faced with a lack of economic opportunities with the West, which threatened to cripple the functioning of Eritrean society, the ruling party needed to seek alternative lifelines. Russia and China hence came into play. As dictatorships concerned primarily with the idea that each country's government should be completely unfettered in its administration of matters pertaining to that country alone, they were less concerned about little scruples like ""democracy"" or ""human rights"". Indeed they were likely to sympathise with Eritrea's condition, themselves having faced the possibility of economic harm from Western sanctions and the support by Western politicians for counter-establishment figures.  Moreover, the two were likely to be eager for new partners in the Red Sea. Both were wary of the American-led coalition that even now patrols the waters of Somalia for piracy. Most of the MENA had ties to the Americans. Djibouti was staunchly pro-American due to the benefits that international trade had provided for them, including foreign bases. The two nations worried that American vessels could stop their own shipping in the Red Sea, and needed a local stakeholder that could help protect these lanes. With Sudan and Eritrea being completely rejected by the West, they could be relied upon to do so out of their own desire for self-preservation. If they did so, Russia and China would be willing to deploy vessels to these countries. This in itself would provide jobs for the maritime industry, which would go a long way to revitalising the moribund ports of Eritrea. In addition, earning goodwill would entail further economic cooperation that could help sustain the Eritrean economy. Eritrea had resources, but not enough money to extract and process them. Hence Eritrea naturally gravitated towards Russia and China. 

Although sanctions were lifted in response to the 2018 peace agreement with Ethiopia, more have been subsequently imposed, particularly in response to the Eritrean occupation of parts of Tigray, which have been viewed as an invasion and have been a catalyst for further war crimes against the Tigrayans. Faced once again with economic isolation, Eritrea has turned again towards the major players of Russia and China. Hence, they have been reluctant to turn on one of their only reliable lifelines(In my frank opinion the West really messed up by antagonising the Horn of Africa states at a time when the Indian Ocean is increasingly contested).",9490e06eefebdb2ca39377ca46b17d2c226a7490,True,False,,,,,0,1646289597,,0,{},hz5izvp,False,t3_t597fe,False,True,t3_t597fe,/r/geopolitics/comments/t597fe/why_did_eritrea_vote_against_in_the_draft/hz5izvp/,1646289613,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646260797.0,

[],False,,Wanghaoping99,,,[],,,,text,t2_t6g13xr,False,False,"I think the fate of people even as high up as Boris Bezerovsky is sufficient to inform the oligarchs that loyalty is their best bet for survival. The oligarchs are, befitting their status as businessmen, not entirely unified as a class. As Roman Abramovich's betrayal of Bezerovsky to gain favours from Putin shows, the oligarchs are competing for power, and there is simply no guarantee for any one of them that the others would not turn on them for their own benefit. Until the situation gets really dire, I doubt they'd even be able to find a candidate successor that's acceptable to all of them. Even then, finding any support at all would be hard. Just about everyone in Russia recalls what they did in the 90s, or is repulsed by their close connection to Putin. A government installed by them would have face a two-fronted opposition from the Putin loyalists in the state and the anger of people tired of minority grandees imposing political solutions on the public. The oligarchs always had to leverage agents to act on their behalf since they themselves had very little legitimacy. Putin offered them a Faustian pact. Either obey and be conferred rewards under the auspices of the state, or be completely stripped of everything they owned. Or in some cases, found to have commited ""suicide"". Today, the oligarchs rely on the state provide them a continued tenure in their positions. Their power is thereby intrinsically connected to the state, to Putin. Hence I do not think they will be wiling to turn on Putin by risking their lives. 

While Putin may rely on oligarchs to perform day to day operations of Russia's industries, he controls the levers of power relative to the corporations. Companies were merged together based on their sector, justifying the creation of new overseeing bodies to coordinate these disparate companies , bodies that oh so happened to be stacked with officials loyal to the state. One may also imagine that the state keeps tabs on the oligarchs . Furthermore, Putin can have other means of compulsion. He could simply relieve them of their positions by using the State Duma. Non-cooperation might lead to criminal investigations. A lack of contracts might cause the company to of their own volition remove the oligarch (not that there would be any love lost). Hence the oligarchs are beholden to the state, not the other way round. 


The oligarchs have lost control over the levers of power that could allow for a legitimate ouster. Putin has created the GONGOs , which allow him to penetrate civic organisations. His patronage of United Russia has turned it into a powerful political organisation that is deeply entwined with the Duma itself, and extends across the empire such that even the leaders of ""autonomous"" republics either are members or are affiliated to the party. Putin has also had time to reorganise the party, ensuring both it and the various heads of Russia's federal subjects are loyal to a fault (observe for instance Kadyrov's incessant boasting of actions in Ukraine as realty to Moscow. Though I'm not sure if he's employed his own Kadyrovtsy secret police). The state also has murkier non-electable institutions. The Siloviki for instance are unlikely to accept an oligarch takeover, and will actively try to stop it from jeopardising their own influence. Nor indeed would they fancy an ex-KGB man, who looks out for them, being ousted from office (Putin also had a short stint as Yeltsin's director of the FSB). There are also other bodies like the council of Security Advisors, in which Medvedev currently participates , that would likely act against them to restore Putin using their shadowy but immense power over the armed forces.

Doesn't matter how long the invasion will take whether another 1-2 weeks. Russia will win. But the myth that Putin created is broken. The Western media bought into the myth that the invasion would be a cakewalk. That was what the Russian media was pumping out. The Chinese media also.  Don't blame the West for gobbling it up.  Everybody was saying the Russians will do what they did in Crimea. Even the Russians recruits themselves believed they would be created as liberators.

What is happening right now is reality. People in the US military wargamed it, and what is happening right now is similar to what they predicted. The Russians tried to do a lightning blitz on Kyiv to decapitate the leadership, the wargamers did exactly that.

&gt;In his speech on Sunday to a special session of German parliament, Scholz announced emergency funding of the German military to the tune of 100 billion euros while also pledging to boost defense spending to above 2 percent of gross national product.

As for the individual calculations of Western politics, who cares. They didn't launch the attack, Putin did.  If I hit you, can I blame it on you for being obnoxious? That is what you are arguing about Putin.

You need proof. You don't have any. China was still sanctioned by the US in the 1970s.

We are at 10 days into this war with Putin only yet to start seiging the main cities because he wanted his narratives unlike what US did in Iraq, basically reducing to rubble any city that stood in its way.

Clearly COVID put a massive wrench in Putin's plans for Ukraine since the previous US government would have supported him and they certainly had to delay their attack. 

I'm sure the sanctions will have an effect but I can't imagine China not propping up Putin's Russia under the table. And what will happen with the sanctions once Ukraine stops fighting? Ukraine may have financial and moral support, but they are still fighting alone and are suffering for it; as far as I can tell the Russians are gradually encircling them and cutting off their supplies and I doubt this will go on for more than a few weeks. 

I imagine that while this armed conflict is only between Russia and Ukraine, the peace treaty will have to be negotiated between them without any outside intervention and that's still a position of power for Putin. I can't see resistance being enough for Russia to lose this war and leave all of Ukraine - expecting that means hoping that Putin's regime will fall before Ukraine taps out and for all of the dissent in Russia, that's misguided. Once peace is signed, whatever the terms, will there still be a justification for sanctions from the West? Moreover, once a peace deal is signed, and resistance is pushed underground, Putin can justifiably label their actions as terrorism. Any moral high ground will be lost.

I hope Putin loses, but this also means Ukraine sacrificing itself for as long as it takes. And if Putin achieves some of his objectives, the current world order denouncing him will look very impotent. I can't help but think NATO has to show a will to escalate to military action, by moving troops around, to help Ukraine negotiate.

""Tribal"" countries like Saudi Arabia where once it was hard to form any state at all have constructed some form of national identity today.

Afghanistan is a conquest state. It's diversity stems from its origin as an outward expansion by the Pashtun people. The old feudal arrangement of royal power lasted into the seventies, due to Afghanistan being excluded from the political upheavals of their neighbours. After that, the tumult of decades of conflict hindered the formation of any communal structures that could bond the people together. It's hard to situate yourself in a nation when said nation fails to provide even basic necessities for you, as though the nation were completely absent. Want water? Looks like the canals got silted up. Need to travel to Kandahar to sell produce?  The road has potholes that have not been maintained. Oh and the local law enforcement would like a few bribes for you to pass the tollbooth. You complained to the government about the local councilman skimming tax dollars to fund his house? Nothing will be done about it because prosecution is mediocre, plus you just made a powerful enemy who can make life miserable for you. 

Fundamentally national identity arises from common involvement in social groupings. If there are few mediums by which Afghans across the country may engage one another then they cannot form bonds of connections, be it camaraderie or friendship, so they cannot relate to each other intimately.  If the Afghan state were allowed a modicum of peace, as well as conscientious government, it could create a social imprint by bringing together citizens in social activities like work and entertainment, which could then foster the national identity.",2a185fa8905bb68fa1e7a5d0f8e4b21c042b20ff,True,False,,,,,0,1646277105,,0,{},hz4wpvq,False,t3_sujq2u,False,True,t1_hyhhcuk,/r/geopolitics/comments/sujq2u/how_likely_are_there_conspirators_in_afghanistan/hz4wpvq/,1646277119,1,True,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0,[],,1646248305.0,

Of course there are some Asian allies (Japan, Korea) who are helping boost the economic sanctions and might provide some weapons, but it is unknown how long they will be willing to keep that support up.

Second, though global opinion may be turning against Russia at the moment, unless we get rid of putin and his inner cadre we are talking major global instability for the foreseeable future. Best case scenario in the near future for Russia and the West is a nastier Cold War 2.0. I was around for the Soviet Union and grew up with duck and cover drills, spent my childhood and early adult life on military bases during that time, and the last several years have been worse on my nerves than any US/Soviet tensions I grew up around. Also putin's belligerence, aggressions and the discord he fomented in the West the last several years has got to be answered. That bill is due and the current Russian domestic situation is probably the best opportunity we will have to collect. I know it is a spicy meatball of a term but regime change in Russia is the only thing that is going to turn down the global temp for any meaningful period.

Third, Turkey, for the most part, has closed off the Bosphorus Straits to the Russian and has supplied drones and other arms to Ukraine, amongst other negative rumblings from Erdogan towards putin shows, in my opinion, a willingness from Turkey to act against putin's empire ambitions. Erdogan smells blood in the water and I think it would be in the interest of global stability to let him fill up a decent part of the region's upcoming power vacuum.

Though I spent some time in the military, I am by education and trade a scientist and will fully admit that I may have a couple naive notions when it comes to geopolitics. Though I still do not see how it would not be in the West's interest to incite Georgia and Azerbaijan to distract putin away from making sound decisions in Ukraine and domestically.

Gladly. The Mueller report is the most well known. Mueller was a prosecutor assigned as Special Counsel Counsel look for the 2016 hack. It's a huge pdf available on the senate intelligence and DoJ sites, but here's a web version that loads fast:

USA charged 12 Russian agents for cyber crime. Specifically these were the agents involved with phishing and malware against DNC and RNC. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44825345.amp

The hack didn't involve directly attacking voting machines or the like. That would probably count as an act of war.

The French Revolution, for example, often presented as the ideal European revolution, ended in bloodshed, total anarchy and eventually a personalist and militarist dictatorship. The American Revolution was really just a war of independence/decolonisation, it didn't topple the existing authorities. The post-communist transitions are the best examples of ""velvet revolutions"", really, but these are the exceptions to the rule.

Hedging on Putin being ousted is a really risky strategy. Both because it's unlikely and because the potential consequences could be equally disastrous. 

The best bet is that public and elite dissatisfaction will somehow factor into Putin's calculus. If he wants to build a legendary status for himself, it may show that continuing this war is harming his reputation more than it is helping. If he wants to make Russians feel safer, sanctions show that it is making the situation worse. If Putin is afraid of democratic pressure from Ukraine, protests show that this pressure is higher with the war than without.

&gt; Within a week, Germany has undergone a dramatic transformation, shedding its reluctant and dovish foreign policy and committing itself to drastically increase defense spending. (...) A country that has been criticized by its allies for doing too little, too late has jumped to the front of the pack to take on a leadership role in European security. Germany now seeks to isolate and punish Russia after decades of appeasing and accommodating it.

The authors illuminate the remarkable process in which longstanding foreign policy dogmas and taboos fell within days, with thunderous applause from almost the entire political spectrum as well as public and media discourse.

Not only is Germany transforming; the perception of Germany is too.

Georgia doesn't have the military strength to mount the kind of resistance Ukraine is putting up. They aren't part of EU or NATO and can't be easily resupplied. Russia could crush them, maybe not right now but soon. They will probably lay low for this conflict. Even if Georgia was willing, USA might want to avoid perceptions of warmongering. Global opinion is turning against Russia and that will ultimately do far more damage to their economy (leading to optimal pressure for a just peace).

Armenia is different case and even bigger no. Militarily, yes Azerbaijan could probably cause big issues. But Russia is guarding the key road directly with its own troops, so it risks immediate escalation.

The thing is that my analysis didn't establish any value judgements on the invasion being good or bad for Russia, in fact I repeatedly pointed out how it would probably have catastrophic effects upon the Russian economy, I simply framed my argument on the geopolitical implications of the invasion. China's growing influence upon Russia is one such implication. Not for nothing, American think-tanks are already talking about the need for the US to prepare for wars in two fronts: The Eastern Europe and Asia-Pacific fronts. An Sino-Russian convenience alliance will greatly benefit China, which will emerge strengthened from all of this not only because of the influence it will exert upon Russia but because it's securing badly needed energy resources.

From the WSJ: ""Entente Multiplies the Threat From Russia and China. The misguided idea that the U.S. needs to ignore one to focus on the other intensifies the danger.""

Russia might not be an economic powerhouse or a superpower in any sense of the world, but somehow we are constantly made to believe that it is able to put presidents in the most powerful country of the world, finance protests that bring a city like Ottawa to a standstill as well as all sort of subversive activities all over the world, have a powerful propaganda machine that can influence minds and needs to be shut down, be experts at fifth generation warfare that can bring down strategic services all over the world, exert influence in a number of countries in Central Asia, and in fact completely destroy the whole world order. So what is it?

This is what Fiona Hill has to say regarding specifically this.

https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/02/28/world-war-iii-already-there-00012340

In any case, whatever catastrophic even the invasion will have on Russian economy does not negate the negative economic impact that it will have on the rest of the world and the long-term effects it will have upon the US/Nato block. I mentioned Syria particularly because, if you have followed the conflict you probably remembered how that country was completely in ruins just a decade ago and somehow it managed to survive. Russia will probably have to eat offal for a long time, and yet, the strategic damage done to SWIFT and the bolstering of CIPS/SPSF after this war won't be undone. I'm talking strategic long-term consequences here.

&gt;Lavrov's severing of diplomatic ties is far from an act of strength, and more likely the realization that few want to listen to him

That's simply your opinion. I saw yesterday a video of delegates walking out of the UN session during Lavrov's speech and I found it hilarious. That to me shows weakness for two reasons: throughout history diplomatic channels have been maintained even between the most ardent enemies even when you know they are lying through their teeth, it's basic common diplomatic sense; but also, is part of a growing trend which puts feelings and perceptions above pragmatic realism. There are still countries that want to listen, and these countries happen to host the majority of the population of the world. If we are to take democracy as a guiding principle and we understand democracy as the will of the people, then we should accept that walking out of the room is the opposite to democratic.

The truth of this is that, regardless of the cost to Russia, Ukraine will not be part of NATO, neither de jure nor de facto as it was happening already and will not be part of Europe either. It is *fait acomplit*. Also it sets an interesting precedent in which the NATO-US alliance did not get it's way (probably a first) which strategically is important, if only because of its effects in peoples' psyches.

Finally, it is starting to show a clear North / South divide in how the invasion is being approached by other countries, hinting perhaps at a Cold War 2.0? The difference is that it will not be fought between a US unscathed by WWII and a country under despised economic regime that suffered 30 million deaths in such war, but by a US which is showing cracks all over and the emerging powerhouses that will overtake it soon:

EDIT - Oh! and I forgot, the casualties sustained by Russia have only been because of their approach toward invasion. Russia could obliterate Ukraine through shock-and-awe if it wanted to, but they are not doing it. Whatever cost they are assuming is calculated. We'll just have to wait and see who is right and who is wrong here.
