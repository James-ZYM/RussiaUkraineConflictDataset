I would like to take this opportunity to highlight a book I have read recently, about a secret mission conducted by Israel's Defense Forces in the late 2000s. **""Shadow Strike: Inside Israel's Secret Mission To Eliminate Syrian Nuclear Power""** (St. Martin's Press, New York, 2019), by Yaakov Katz. Mr. Katz is the editor-in-chief of *The Jerusalem Post* and co-author of *Weapon Wizards* and *Israel vs. Iran*. He previously served as a senior policy adviser to Israel's minister of Economy and minister of Diaspora Affairs and as a lecturer at Harvard University. In 2013, he spent a year at the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University.

The book is the most detailed publicly available account of **Operation Outside the Box**. Operation OTB was a covert operation conducted by the Israeli Air Force in 2007 to destroy Syria's sole nuclear reactor in the final stages of construction in the desert near Deir ez-Zor, in Eastern Syria.

Few people know that in the 2000s, the Syrian government began the construction of a nuclear reactor, on Syrian soil, with North Korean technical assistance. As the author explains, the Syrian government was seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, which it viewed as a security guarantee against Israel.

The book relates how the Israeli government discovered the presence of the Syrian reactor and the connections between the Syrian government and the North Korean government, how Israeli agents conducted a covert raid on Syria's top nuclear scientist in Geneva, Switzerland, how the Israeli government communicated this intelligence to the United States, and how the military operation was executed.

The author explains the scope of the book:

&gt; This book tells - for the first time and from the perspective of Jerusalem and Washington, DC - the full and true story behind Israel's daring operation to destroy the al-Kibar nuclear reactor, which was being built under a tight veil of secrecy in the Syrian desert, in September 2007. It is a tale of espionage, political courage, military might and psychological warfare on a national scale.

&gt; It is also a story that brings Israel's powerful military and diplomatic alliance with the United States to life. It reveals what happens behind the closed doors and heated debates in the Oval Office in Washington, the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem and the underground military command center beneath IDF headquarters in Tel Aviv.

&gt; It is a story of extreme importance and relevance, as these two countries remain united in a nonstop battle to prevent nuclear proliferation, to defeat Islamic terror and to curtail Iran's attempts to spread its hegemony throughout the Middle East. While this story takes place in 2007, the ramifications of what happened in Syria continue to impact the world we live in today.

&gt; The events of September 6, 2007, were, for the most part, a success. Israel discovered a threat, took action, neutralized it and avoided a larger conflict. But it could have been different. Had Israel not learned of the existence of Syria's reactor, what would the Middle East look like today? It is scary just to think about.

At 295 pages long in its hardcover version, including the endbook notes, the book is not particularly long, or technically complex, and is very readable. It reads like a thriller, except that everything is true and really happened.

Here are the first few pages of the first chapter, to give you an idea of what the book entails.

&gt; **1: A RAID IN VIENNA**

&gt; In the middle of April 2007, a short, bald and burly man with a limp and a cane walked into the West Wing of the White House. He carried a small briefcase with a few folders chaotically jutting out.

&gt; The man showed his diplomatic passport at the entrance. He was under the impression that he would be brought directly to the Oval Office for a private meeting with the president but, instead, the guards were under orders to keep his name off the official visitor logs and to clandestinely escort him to the office of National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley. Inside, two other men were waiting: Hadley's deputy, Elliott Abrams, and a surprise guest, the vice president of the United States, Dick Cheney.

&gt; The man the trio had gathered to meet was Meir Dagan, the renowned and feared head of the Mossad, Israel's legendary foreign spy agency and the equivalent of the CIA. A few days earlier, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert had called President George W. Bush and told him that Dagan would be coming to Washington with some important information. ""I'd appreciate if you could meet him,"" Olmert told Bush.

&gt; The request, phrased in a way that seemed urgent, took Bush and his staff by surprise. Heads of state - even close allies like Olmert - don't usually ask the president to meet the directors of their intelligence agencies alone. If they ever do meet them, it is almost always according to diplomatic protocol and in the presence of the foreign leader.

&gt; So, the president's aides decided to stick to protocol. They would first meet Dagan, evaluate whatever information he was bringing with him, and, if needed, take him to see the president. Cheney was briefed about the pending visit and decided to sit in on the meeting. He knew Dagan and figured that based on Olmert's special request, it must be urgent.

&gt; Dagan took a seat on the couch. Cheney settled into a large blue wing chair to his right. Not one for small talk, Dagan got straight to the point.

&gt; ""Syria is building a nuclear reactor,"" the Mossad chief said in his thick Israeli accent. ""For Syria to have a nuclear weapons program, to have a nuclear weapon, is unacceptable.""

&gt; Dagan then pulled the first folder out of his bag and spread a number of color photos on the coffee table. Cheney lifted one. Hadley and Abrams took another. They could clearly make out a concrete building under construction with some large pipes being installed inside. There was nothing yet that showed the building to be a nuclear reactor. It didn't have the typical dome or smokestacks, the trademarks of nuclear facilities.

&gt; ""That is the nuclear reactor,"" Dagan told the group. It was a gas-cooled graphite-moderated reactor, he explained, used to produce plutonium, and was being built as an almost exact replica of the Yongbyon nuclear reactor in North Korea. The concrete building on the exterior was a fa√ßade being built to hide what was really happening inside.

&gt; The Americans were speechless. There were dozens of photos. Cheney, Hadley and Abrams just watched and listened as Dagan pulled out one after another and explained in detail what they were. One of the photographs looked too good to be true. It showed two men posing in front of the concrete structure. One of the men, of Asian ethnicity, was wearing a blue tracksuit. The man he was standing next to, Dagan said, was Ibrahim Othman, head of Syria's Atomic Energy Commission.

&gt; Dagan then showed his hosts another photo. It was the same Asian man, although this time he wasn't wearing workout clothes but a tailored suit and black tie. From their intelligence experience, the Americans knew what they were looking at. It was a photo taken at a recent meeting of the Six Party Talks, the negotiations America and other Western superpowers were conducting with North Korea in an effort to stop its rogue nuclear program. The man in the photo, Dagan said, was Chon Chibu, one of the scientists in charge of the Yongbyon nuclear reactor.

&gt; The news was earth-shattering. Until then, there was no evidence in the US intelligence community to support what Dagan was claiming. None. Everyone knew about North Korea's nuclear ambitions - the hermit country had tested its first nuclear weapon just a few months earlier in October 2006 - but there was nothing to even hint that Pyongyang was proliferating its technology and helping Syria build a nuclear weapon. It wasn't just shocking. It was a strategic nightmare of worldwide proportions.

&gt; Dagan continued to pull additional photos out of his bag. It was an intelligence treasure trove. There were photos of the vertical tube openings at the top of the reactor used to hold control rods and another of the reinforced concrete reactor vessel with its steel lining.

&gt; Israel, Dagan said, had already found the facility. It was buried deep in the desert in northeastern Syria in a region known as Deir ez-Zor, along the Euphrates River. The Syrians, he explained, had used the river to help conceal their rogue nuclear activity. They had built the reactor in a *wadi*, a valley, so it couldn't be seen by passing cars or hikers. The outer square structure that surrounded the reactor was built to look like an old Ottoman-era fort, no different from the countless other old guard posts scattered throughout the desert.

My impression of the book is that it is a very detailed and serious account of this story. It offers an interesting glimpse into the real decision-making processes of the US and Israeli governments and of the tradecraft Israel is capable of. The book explains how political factors, on both the American and Israeli sides, influenced the military planning, and, conversely, how military factors and the available intelligence affected the political decision making.

The book is relevant today because the Israeli military is [presently conducting a major exercise to simulate an attack against Iran](https://breakingdefense.com/2022/05/israeli-military-exercise-to-simulate-attack-on-iranian-nuclear-targets/)

&gt; As Israeli leaders sound the alarm about what they say is an acute, active threat from Iran‚Äôs nuclear program, Israel plans to conduct a major military exercise, with some US participation, part of which will simulate attacks on Iranian nuclear targets, according to Israeli officials.

&gt; The exercise comes as Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz alleged Tuesday that Iran was ‚Äújust a few weeks‚Äù away from having enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb.

There has been talk of war between Iran and Israel since the 2000s, at least, but the odds are growing that a real war between Iran and Israel could erupt within the next 12 months, especially if the nuclear talks with the United States collapse. If Israel were to launch an attack on Iran's nuclear sites, it would undoubtedly draw from its experience in Syria in 2007, as well as from its experience destroying the Osirak nuclear reactor in Iraq in 1981, an event which this book sometimes alludes to but doesn't cover in detail.

This book is essential reading for anyone who wants to gain a deeper understanding of Israel's military and intelligence capabilities, the internal debates surrounding Israel's threat perceptions, and the modern history of the Middle East. Even as the U.S. withdrew from Afghanistan and is pivoting to the Western Pacific, I think we haven't finished hearing about the Middle East, and the region has at least a few more surprises left for the rest of us in the future.",False,False,False,CredibleDefense,t5_2y5ib,57842,public,self,"Book Spotlight: ""Shadow Strike: Inside Israel's Secret Mission To Eliminate Syrian Nuclear Power"" by Yaakov Katz.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uwcmav/book_spotlight_shadow_strike_inside_israels/,some_ads,7,1653317511.0,,,,,
