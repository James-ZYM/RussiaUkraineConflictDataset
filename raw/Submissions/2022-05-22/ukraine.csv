Zaporizhzhia – Two sisters quickly packed their stuff and rushed out the door when Russian troops stormed into their hometown Enerhodar. 

They knew that their lives would be in danger after having spent years working as volunteers to help supply the Ukrainian military on the eastern front during the eight-year-long war. 

Maria, 48, and her older sister Anna, 52, went into hiding, trying not to settle in one place for too long.

The sisters were already frightened after the Russian troops began firing at Europe’s largest nuclear power facility standing within visible distance from where the sisters lived. 

The attack on the plant led to international outrage with memories still fresh of the 1986 explosion at Ukraine’s Chornobyl nuclear power plant, the world’s worst nuclear accident. 

Though paralyzed with fear after seeing the smoke rise in the sky, Anna and Maria didn’t know that the worst was yet to come. Shortly afterward, Russian troops surrounded and seized the facility in early March, then captured the city itself without much resistance. 

The sisters’ decision to hide from the incoming Russians was proven right. Weeks later, their friends told them that they were on the Russians’ list of wanted residents. 

“These are the execution lists,” Maria told the Kyiv Independent. 

The sisters knew that some people, particularly ex-military personnel, went missing after Russian soldiers came to search their homes and scare off their relatives. 

Even as grocery shopping became a difficult task and cash was running low, their friends always found a way to bring them food so that Maria and Anna didn’t have to leave the house. 

The variety of food was very limited, with open-air markets mostly selling Russian-branded grains and pasta brought from Russian-occupied Crimea, Maria said. 

In late March, Russian soldiers kidnapped Enerhodar’s first deputy mayor Ivan Samoidiuk and were patrolling the city as though they owned it, according to Maria.

She added that they were mostly walking in groups of three, with a gun in their hands. “It was really hard to live there,” Maria added. 

Residents continued to organize peaceful protests against the Russian occupation, but the invading troops would come and disperse such meetings by detaining activists or threatening them with weapons.

Despite that, Maria said that the residents were still hoping that “our army would come and free us” and this was only going to last for a couple of weeks. 

“But then, we began to understand that it wasn’t so simple,” Maria admitted. 

Once the sisters saw an opportunity to escape their hometown, they took the chance. 

Getting to the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia wasn’t easy either. The Russians were particularly aggressive near Enerhodar and they were all drunk, Maria said. They would check all belongings in the car and make everyone get out of the car at checkpoints, she added. 

The sisters also saw how Russian troops forced a group of three women and two kids (three and six-year-olds) to get out of the car and then just took the vehicle away. At another checkpoint, they saw the Russians taking away two buses, and “they were just looting,” Maria said. 

What is usually a two-hour journey between their hometown Enerhodar and Zaporizhzhia turned into a nine-hour drive, but the sisters made it to the Ukrainian-controlled territory safely. Their phones were searched but they were allowed to keep their devices. 

“We don’t know how we survived,” Maria said. 

Fleeing to freedom

Maria and Anna are among hundreds of Ukrainians arriving in Zaporozhzhia’s reception center on a daily basis to escape Russian occupation. 

The city became a sanctuary for those fleeing the Russian occupation of southern Ukraine. At present, about 70 percent of Zaporizhzhia Oblast is in the hands of Russia, while neighboring Kherson Oblast is almost entirely controlled by Moscow.

Meanwhile, in Zaporizhzhia, a large white tent in a shopping center parking lot awaits evacuees, with volunteers handing out food, clothes, medicine, and other essential needs.

Further along, a noticeboard is filled with announcements offering to transport evacuees westwards and photos of missing relatives. 

Behind the crowd of evacuees lining up for a plate of a warm meal is a man sitting in silence. Despite having spent a week in Zaporizhzhia already, he seems to have difficulty processing the horrors that they lived through in his hometown Melitopol.

Melitopol, the second-largest city in Zaporizhzhia Oblast now in the hands of the Russians, has faced a similar fate as Enerhodar.

“It’s impossible to live there,” Dmytro, 41, told the Kyiv Independent. 

The city of over 150,000 people lies on a stretch of southern Ukraine that Moscow has been eyeing since 2014 when it annexed the Crimean peninsula. Russian forces attacked Melitopol on the morning of Feb. 25 and captured it in early March after days of heavy fighting around the city.

As the Russian troops began shelling administrative buildings of Melitopol, local residents took shelter to keep themselves safe. Like many others, Dmytro’s family lived in the basement while the active fighting lasted and then eventually went back to live in their own apartment once the fighting ceased. 

The loud days faded away following Russia’s seizure of the city but occasional shelling continued, Dmytro said. He was especially worried about the safety of his family so his wife and daughters (7 and 11-year-olds) stayed at home while he would go out every single day to go buy food. 

“We tried to survive and protect our children,” he said. 

Like in other occupied cities, Russian soldiers patrol the streets of Melitopol in cars and armored vehicles marked with the “Z” symbol that denotes the Kremlin’s occupying force. 

The only place where residents could buy food was in open-air markets but there were only a few in Melitopol, Dmytro said. There was no more food left in grocery stores and it was difficult to live there, especially as medicine also became scarce, he added. 

People could only use the little cash that they had left since it wasn’t possible to withdraw cash from ATMs anymore and credit card payments weren’t an option, according to the evacuees. 

“We weren’t ready at all,” Dmytro admitted. “The war is spontaneous and like everyone, I had little (money) in my pocket.” 

Ukrainian internet services and mobile networks have either been shut down or rarely appear in the occupied parts of Zaporizhzhia Oblast.

Dmytro said that he couldn’t access the internet at all during the first month of occupation, which left him perplexed about the events unfolding in Ukraine. Neither his mobile network nor TV worked, so he had no way of accessing information, he explained. 

“For a whole month there was practically no mobile connection, nothing,” he said. “In March, there was no information at all.” 

Amid the uncertainty, Dmytro didn’t know if it was even possible to escape Melitopol. But once the internet gradually came back, he began to have more hope. 

A local volunteer, who has made a Viber group chat to coordinate evacuation plans for remaining residents, persuaded Dmytro’s family and many others to leave together. Still, in awe of the act of kindness, Dmytro said the volunteer stayed behind to continue arranging evacuation plans for more people. 

Dmytro, a former professor, remembers the escape with great pain. 

“We were leaving at our own risk, with fear,” he said. “There are mines on the roads and they (Russians) could shoot you.” 

Russian troops were especially hostile both physically and morally towards Ukrainian men at checkpoints, he said. They were firing guns, while sometimes families had to wait for days inside the car or find a shelter if heavy fighting suddenly broke out along the way. 

“This was happening in front of children,” he said painfully. 

Dmytro said that even when they saw vehicles burning, it was impossible to stop the car and step outside to have a look because “step left into the field, step right, it can be mined.”

Russian oppression 

Similar to the events unfolding in other occupied territories of Zaporizhzhia Oblast, the Russians have torn down Ukrainian symbols from all buildings in Melitopol. 

In a further attempt to fake a pro-Russian sentiment in the Ukrainian city, Russians have also tried to gather local residents to celebrate May 9 Victory Day but failed, the city’s mayor Ivan Fedorov said. 

Russian troops instead forcibly moved about 3,000 people from occupied Crimea, Luhansk, and nearby villages to take part in the “Immortal Regiment” march to boast about the Soviet defeat of Nazi Germany, according to a local publication.

Amid weeks of Russian oppression, local residents are taking risks to flee Melitopol even as Russian occupiers opened fire on them and tried to prevent them from leaving the city, according to Fedorov, who himself spent days in Russian custody.

The mayor, who was kidnapped by Russian forces in early March and held for five days, stressed that despite the “great demand” from civilians to be evacuated from Melitopol, Russians have not agreed to a centralized evacuation for a month. 

Fedorov said that it remains “a real challenge” for people to leave the city by private transport, with many of them driving over 10 hours while having to drive under fire. Some columns have to wait for a couple of days until they are allowed to pass through. 

Over 60% of residents have fled Melitopol, which leaves about 60,000 to 70,000 people in the city, according to the official. 

Back in April, Fedorov also reported that Russians began forcibly mobilizing Ukrainian men into their army and blocking them from exiting the city. 

He said that a full-scale mobilization into the Russian army had begun and they were also offering Ukrainian men to join the Russian Armed Forces at checkpoints. 

From one region to another

Zaporizhzhia became a safe haven for those fleeing Kherson Oblast, as well.

Sitting at a long table under the marquee in Zaporizhzhia’s evacuation center is a family of five, eating warm soup prepared by volunteers. Originally from a small village in Kherson Oblast occupied by the Russians since the early days of the war, the family still seems to have difficulty coming to terms with reality. 

“We had good lives until they (the Russian occupiers) came,” 47-year-old mother Svitlana Ivanova told the Kyiv Independent. 

Their peaceful village life was gone in just days since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. 

Even after the Russians had seized most parts of Kherson Oblast, their village was “very loud” with the sounds of missiles and airplanes flying above them, Ivanova said. Living near the annexed Crimea where many actively-used Russian air bases are located, the family heard the planes almost every day and missiles being launched from there. 

“At half-past five in the morning, you are sleeping at home and then hear a terrifying roar. You jump out and (learn that) four missiles hit somewhere in Ukraine.” 

“It can be in the morning, in the evening,” she continued. 

As a mother, Ivanova was worried that her four-year-old son would develop a trauma after living weeks under constant threats. She said he was too little to understand the loud sounds of warplanes and missiles over his head, but “he was very scared when he saw (Russian) soldiers and saw (their) tanks.” 

After long consideration, Ivanova’s family decided to leave their hometown. It was especially difficult during the first weeks when shops were empty and they were baking bread with the flour that they had left. 

Thankfully, the family also raised chickens so they had plenty of eggs. 

“We ate eggs every day, probably ate enough for the rest of our lives,” grandmother Vera Ivanova, 73, told the Kyiv Independent. 

Eventually, Russian-produced goods began appearing and staple foods such as bread, grains, flour, and sugar were sold at open-air markets though they were highly overpriced and limited in variety, the family said. The prices were inflated sixfold, Ivanova added. 

Banks no longer had cash for the locals to withdraw but some open-air markets were accepting credit card payments, according to Ivanova.

The former teacher, whose pre-war salary was also small, said the family struggled to remain afloat. Her husband is a driver, and neither of them could work since Feb. 24, and yet they had two children to raise. 

Amid continuing sounds of warplanes and missiles reminding them of the war each day, the family soon headed to occupied Melitopol, about 80 kilometers from their hometown, before they eventually arrived in Zaporizhzhia. 

“We left all our bags at home, took (some) things, and drove off,” Ivanova said. “It was difficult to decide whether to stay or not. They (both) were very scary.”

**Ukrainian army volunteer center "" Center for Assistance to the Army, Veterans and Their Families""**  
I am a 20 y.o reddit volunteer, if i can say so :) 2 month ago I created a telegram channel with combat footage and was promoting it on Reddit by adding red watermarks combat\_ftg ([https://t.me/combat\_ftg](https://t.me/combat_ftg)). You have probably seen my videos a few times )

Now it has grown to almost 10 000 subs. In total I got about 20 000$ for our soldiers by gathering donations, selling “Russian warship” stamps, selling military patches and signs for rockets. We bought many thermal scopes, some cars, night vision device and other equipment.

 

*Processing img e0dzf3r9x2191...*

 **The biggest part of our volunteers are women. Every day they deliver packages with equipment and food for soldiers at the front. You could see the video of them almost getting shelled:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/udse70/exclusive\_video\_from\_our\_volunteers\_under/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/udse70/exclusive_video_from_our_volunteers_under/)  
Also our volunteers and the sound of artillery shells in the background:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSyo0stke\_k&amp;t=169s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSyo0stke_k&amp;t=169s)   


#  Most of our female volunteers have husbands and brothers at the front.

**A few weeks ago a Ukrainian hero Roman Gribov, the soldier who said the most famous words in Ukraine “Russian warship go fuck yourself” visited our volunteer center and signed our envelopes to help us to get some money by selling them on the Internet.**  
Also a few days ago I spent 40 hours getting to Lviv and back, and met Boris Groh, the artist who painted a picture for stamps. He also signed our envelopes and we got some exclusive and very rare variants of them.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img flvjcyjk03191...*

Previously a first day cover envelope with Roman\`s sign was sold for 6000$, but our center hopes to get more money as it\`s a charity auction and a very little amount of envelopes were signed together by the artist and the soldier.

**All money from these sales will be spent on equipment for Ukrainian soldiers. You will also receive photo reports.**  
You can see the auction with our envelopes here: [https://www.ebay.com/itm/Unique-FDC-Kyiv-envelope-signed-by-Roman-Gribov-and-Boris-Groh-Russian-warship/304495116761](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Unique-FDC-Kyiv-envelope-signed-by-Roman-Gribov-and-Boris-Groh-Russian-warship/304495116761)

Or one cheaper(because first day envelopes with a seal are the most expensive) at a fixed price: [https://www.ebay.com/usr/big-trout?\_trksid=p2047675.m3561.l2559](https://www.ebay.com/usr/big-trout?_trksid=p2047675.m3561.l2559)

**Our center bought a car for Roman\`s military unit as a thankful gift for his signs. Soon Roman will return to fight and continue defending Ukraine from invaders.**

She is a badass war reporter, who spent the last months documenting Russian war crimes and Ukrainian victories. The last week, she traveled in the region around Kharkiv, shadowing the Ukrainian army as they pushed back the Russians in the region. Her work got the attention of the Russians and put her in some [unwanted spotlight.](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2022/05/wthe-russian-propaganda-machine-transgender-journalist/)   


We will open a thread on Monday evening (European time) to give our timezone-challenged redditors a chance to get their questions in. AMA will run through Wednesday morning (European time) for the same reason.

Lawmakers gave a standing ovation to President Andrzej Duda, who thanked them for the honor of speaking where “the heart of a free, independent and democratic Ukraine beats.” Duda received more applause when he said that to end the conflict, Ukraine did not need to submit to conditions given by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“Unfortunately, in Europe there have also been disturbing voices in recent times demanding that Ukraine yield to Putin’s demands,” he said. “I want to say clearly: Only Ukraine has the right to decide about its future. Only Ukraine has the right to decide for itself.”

Duda’s visit, his second to Kyiv since April, came as Russian and Ukrainian forces battled along a 551-kilometer (342-mile) wedge of the country’s eastern industrial heartland.

After retreating from northern Ukraine, Moscow has made the battle for Sievierodonetsk a priority as it tries to capture the entire Donbas, and it has deployed heavier artillery and armored vehicles in an effort to break through Ukrainian defenses.

DONETSK REGION, Ukraine — Two fighters jets flew low over Ukrainian positions in the eastern part of the country on Sunday afternoon, dropping flares, then sweeping around in an arc and disappearing. Ukrainian soldiers crouched low, watching and waiting, unsure if the jets were friendly or enemy aircraft.

Half an hour later, the sounds of incoming mortar fire whistled further along the hillside.

After failing to secure a quick victory in northern Ukraine early in the war and retreating from areas around the capital, Russian forces have shifted focus and firepower to the east.

Russian troops are pushing south from the city of Izium and from positions to the east in an attempt to encircle the Ukrainians and seize the entire Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, which consists of Donetsk and its neighboring province, Luhansk.

The battles have been bloody, but neither side has been able to move the frontline substantially in their favor throughout the chaotic battlefield, a landscape dominated by farmland and small mining towns and villages that are mostly deserted.

For weeks, Ukrainian and Russian troops have been engaged in a grueling war of attrition, often fighting fiercely over small areas, as one village falls into Russian hands on one day only to be retaken by the Ukrainians a few days later.

On Sunday, Ukraine’s military said Russian forces had attacked several locations along the front line in the east. In an assessment of the war published early Sunday evening, it described intensive artillery bombardments on mostly deserted towns and villages.

To the north of the city of Sloviansk in Donetsk, which Russian forces have been seeking to capture, Russian artillery bombarded Ukrainian positions and staged probing attacks that were rebuffed, the Ukrainian military’s report said.

Farther to the east, Russian forces attacked two frontline villages — Prudnovka and Aleksandrovka — with mortar and artillery fire but also failed to advance, according to the assessment.

“They are trying bit by bit, all the time,” said Oleh, 56, the commander of a unit of volunteers manning positions south of Izium, a Russian-controlled city that Russia is using as a staging ground for its offensive in Donbas. He asked that his surname and the location of specific frontline positions not be identified, according to military protocol.

Frontline positions were under persistent artillery fire, he said, “but we are holding.”

Ukraine has released few details about military casualties, but President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday that “from 50 to 100” soldiers are dying each day in eastern Ukraine, according to Ukrainian media.

Oleh, the commander, said that Ukrainian troops had held their positions for two months and that he was confident they could stave off further attacks — as long as Western military assistance keeps coming.

“We are ready for anything,” he said, “but we need more heavy weapons, and on this we rely on our allies.”",True,False,False,ukraine,t5_2qqcn,724681,public,confidence,self,Grueling battles on Ukraine’s eastern front fail to shift the war’s momentum. - Washington Post update an hour ago,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/uvkyqz/grueling_battles_on_ukraines_eastern_front_fail/,no_ads,0.0,1653226913.0,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '52mWgnKCyPyjaT9XrmxWmayIILBWT5YKgDn0nwA6ZFU', 'resolutions': [{'height': 56, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/SI0cjWsgJQV2yuZ8mIRMuf_a0gm3xs3upqgyMw05ZLA.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=465c719a46acbf4aec91a640722e535fb66c1294', 'width': 108}, {'height': 113, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/SI0cjWsgJQV2yuZ8mIRMuf_a0gm3xs3upqgyMw05ZLA.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0cee1ebecc98a2a790a801f70d1146462399a52', 'width': 216}, {'height': 167, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/SI0cjWsgJQV2yuZ8mIRMuf_a0gm3xs3upqgyMw05ZLA.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f388d5d096523c04fc5dbbfba5d3868c781017f9', 'width': 320}, {'height': 335, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/SI0cjWsgJQV2yuZ8mIRMuf_a0gm3xs3upqgyMw05ZLA.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ff4736de16d774d8bc85d8614c7f8e0e4b36a6f', 'width': 640}, {'height': 502, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/SI0cjWsgJQV2yuZ8mIRMuf_a0gm3xs3upqgyMw05ZLA.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e2990e92fa7f9af5e8b13b17cb1690847168bbd', 'width': 960}], 'source': {'height': 550, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/SI0cjWsgJQV2yuZ8mIRMuf_a0gm3xs3upqgyMw05ZLA.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=599d646dc801ec37dd96e89a8bb699d649e6a3dd', 'width': 1050}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,

Updates from key battlefields: Strikes on Severodonetsk; Russia eyes Slovyansk

Donbas, under assault, faces ‘extremely difficult’ situation, Zelensky says

Ukrainian leaders are warning of an increasingly dire situation in Severodonetsk — one of the last major cities in eastern Luhansk province still in Kyiv’s control — with a high-ranking official saying it is becoming “a new Mariupol.”

Military analysts say Russian forces are attempting to encircle the strategic city in a bid to control all of Luhansk. Russian troops destroyed a bridge into Severodonetsk on Saturday, making it harder to evacuate people and bring supplies in.

The region’s governor, Serhiy Haidai, said Sunday that “if they destroy one more bridge, then the city will be fully cut off, unfortunately.” He said about 10,000 people remain in Severodonetsk, which had a prewar population of more than 100,000 — and most “are almost constantly in bomb shelters.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the only way out of the war will be through diplomacy — in addition to a win for Kyiv on the battlefield. Meanwhile, a delegation of U.S. diplomats is traveling to The Hague on Sunday for talks with allies on “atrocities committed in Ukraine,” the State Department said.

Here’s what else to know

Polish President Andrzej Duda delivered the first in-person address by a foreign leader to Kyiv’s parliament since the war began. He stressed Ukraine’s right to determine its own future.

Russia is likely to have deployed its only operational company of BMP-T “Terminator” tank support vehicles to Severodonetsk, Britain’s Defense Ministry said.

Zelensky said Sunday that as many as 100 soldiers are killed in hard-hit eastern Ukraine each day. His government has released relatively little information on battleground deaths.

This war is against the whole civilized world.      
Intimidating the world, he resorted to madness - hunger. He decided to blockade Ukrainian ports and all Ukrainian exports. According to the United Nations, one-fifth of the world's population is starving.
The issue of lifting the Russian blockade is no less important for our cooperation with the West than the supply of weapons to Ukraine.      

We offer a comprehensive program, an agreed plan for the implementation of ways to unblock Ukrainian ports and blockade Russian export cargo.      

✅ The first way is the UN position on counter-blocking Russia's merchant fleet if Ukraine is not unblocked.      

✅ The second way is that NATO member ships with a mandate can escort trade convoys to help unlock. And an attack on a NATO member ship will be seen as an attack on NATO. With the corresponding destruction of points from where the enemy tried to attack Ukraine.      
If Russia continues to block Ukrainian ports and impose an embargo, we can unite with the world to block Russian merchant ships and chartered vessels carrying Russian cargo.       

✅ The third point is the immediate supply of anti-aircraft, anti-ship weapons. Every air target, every naval target, every coastal battery, missiles that will attack peaceful trade convoys will be destroyed by the Ukrainian military.       

✅ And the fourth component of this plan is the construction of dry ports on railway infrastructure centers and hubs. To this end, we expect joint investments for the construction of dry ports and grain wagons.

First is this reasoning from the Royal United Services Institute for Defence Studies, a British defence and security think tank.  [https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/war-still-presents-nuclear-risks-especially-relation-crimea](https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/war-still-presents-nuclear-risks-especially-relation-crimea)  The author steps through a very plausible set of scenarios to conclude that the risk of NCD use by Russia is relatively low but goes up significantly when Russia's occupation of Crimea is threatened.  I agree with the piece as far as it goes.  It's quite plausible that the conclusion in the last paragraph is true.... as Russia's control of Crimea is threatened, the increased risk of NCD use might very well make it easier for both sides to talk about a ceasefire that leaves Russia in Crimea - at least for now.   Without saying if that's a good idea or a bad idea, the fact is, this poses an increased risk and an increased risk increases the pressure to find an alternative - in other words, to again consider appeasement.  Objectively, as the risk of NCD use goes up, so does the pressure to make  this choice.   Reading this first piece just at face value, it is well-reasoned and this American nobody (i.e., me) agrees with all of that.   The problem with this piece is that reading between the lines, it seems the author is subtly advocating Ukraine to choose appeasement.   From my safe living room overseas, I think that would be a lousy choice  and here is why.....  

The second analysis is an op-ed  that appeared in the Atlantic Council, [https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/appeasement-is-the-worst-possible-policy-for-both-ukraine-and-russia/](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/appeasement-is-the-worst-possible-policy-for-both-ukraine-and-russia/)   Here the author condemns the west's misunderstanding that Russia's primary motivations are NATO expansion (a responsive motivation), instead of Russia's centuries-old racist imperial ambitions (an inherent proactive motivation that has nothing to do with NATO).    Appeasement validates and feeds the Russian propaganda of racial superiority and its ""victimization narrative"";  helps ordinary citizens avoid self-reflection of their nation's dysfunction; precludes improved relations and economic advantages of better relations with neighbors, leaving  ordinary Russians ""mired in the repressive governance and economic stagnation that are the trademarks of the Putin regime.""   Russia will also have to maintain the crackdown against resistance, making liberalization even more impossible.   Finally, the author believes appeasement's devastating impact on the Russian economy will result in China acquiring stakes in devalued Russain companies,  ""accelerat(ing) Russia’s transformation into a de-industrialized resource  appendage locked to authoritarian China with poor prospects for future  democratization.""

My personal view is that someone, somewhere, needs to tell Russia ""this far, and no further"" despite Russia's possible use of NCD.   To walk the post-WWII talk of ""Never again!"" and ""Not on my watch!""   sitting safe at home in America, it is easy for me to hope that the world will ask Ukraine to be the one to stare down the Russian imperialistic bully, but it is not my family asked to face possible use of tactical NCDs.   So all I can say is if the rest of the world asks Ukraine to be the time and place,  we need to have Ukraine's back, no real questions asked, as far as it goes and as much as it takes.

The residents of Kharkiv were required by emergency decree to darken their homes at night, so as not to provide Russian planes or artillerists with targets. If they had to keep a light on — if they were lucky enough to have electricity — they covered their windows with blankets or plastic tarps or shards of broken furniture.

Kharkivites may have known to do this anyway, without the decree, and not only because the war had knocked out their windowpanes, along with their power, and heating, and water. They just seemed to have an instinct for how to act under siege.

So when the rocket struck Lesia Serdiuka Street after sunset, in the last week of March, a month into the war, the sky above the city was not like an urban night sky, but more rural, the ambient light absent. The starlight was obscured by the sodden cloud cover of early spring.

The rocket hit a gas main, and the blast reverberated through the city. It shook the panes of my hotel-room windows two miles away. The flames rose and were reflected in the clouds, turning the sky a hellish scarlet.

The gas was still burning the next morning when the photographer Paolo Pellegrin and I arrived at the site of the explosion, in the Saltivka district. Fire licked the lip of the rocket’s crater. The trees along Serdiuka Street were branchless and blackened. On one side of the street, faintly visible through the sooty mist, was the steeple of an Orthodox church, its brass onion dome pierced by shrapnel. On the other, residential towers were charred from shelling. Many were in flames. Whole exteriors had been shorn off, leaving the homes smears of plaster and flooring and wallpaper.

People were still living in Saltivka, some by choice, most because they had no choice. They tried to go outside as little as possible. But in the early mornings, when there were lulls in the shelling, they ventured out for groceries or to walk their dogs. They stepped around the craters and through the debris. If the lull was long enough, they stopped to talk. And what was there to talk of but the war?

“Ninety percent of these rockets go into residential areas,” a man said as he watched the flames. He had with him an attentive Doberman pinscher pup, her ears bound in white medical tape. “Look at Druzhby Narodiv Street. Obliterated. The whole area, destroyed. There is nothing military there. The closest thing is a firehouse.”

Kharkiv has been under continuous attack for nearly three months. The second-most-populous city in Ukraine and the gateway to the country’s east, Kharkiv is strategically important.

It is also symbolically important. The historian Volodymyr Kravchenko calls it a “borderland city” not just because it is so near the border. As long as Ukraine has been independent, it has been a place of divided loyalties, partly a forward-looking nation, partly a backward-looking onetime Soviet republic.

Kharkiv has lived this divide like no other Ukrainian city. That is why I went to see the war as it was experienced there.",True,False,False,ukraine,t5_2qqcn,724183,public,confidence,self,"In Kharkiv, residents had an instinct for knowing how to survive under siege. - NYTimes today",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/uv275p/in_kharkiv_residents_had_an_instinct_for_knowing/,no_ads,0.0,1653159719.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

**Ukrainian army volunteer center "" Center for Assistance to the Army, Veterans and Their Families""**  
I am a 20 y.o reddit volunteer, if i can say so :) 2 month ago I created a telegram channel with combat footage and was promoting it on Reddit by adding red watermarks combat\_ftg (https://t.me/combat\_ftg). You have probably seen my videos a few times ) 

Now it has grown to almost 10 000 subs. In total I got about 20 000$ for our soldiers by gathering donations, selling “Russian warship” stamps, selling military patches and signs for rockets. We bought many thermal scopes, some cars, night vision device and other equipment.

The biggest part of our volunteers are women. Every day they deliver packages with equipment and food for soldiers at the front. You could see the video of them almost getting shelled: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/udse70/exclusive\_video\_from\_our\_volunteers\_under/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/udse70/exclusive_video_from_our_volunteers_under/)  
Also our volunteers and the sound of artillery shells in the background:

#  Most of our female volunteers have husbands and brothers at the front.

**A few weeks ago a Ukrainian hero Roman Gribov, the soldier who said the most famous words in Ukraine “Russian warship go fuck yourself” visited our volunteer center and signed our envelopes to help us to get some money by selling them on the Internet.**  
Also a few days ago I spent 40 hours getting to Lviv and back, and met Boris Groh, the artist who painted a picture for stamps. He also signed our envelopes and we got some exclusive and very rare variants of them.

Previously a first day cover envelope with Roman\`s sign was sold for 6000$, but our center hopes to get more money as it\`s a charity auction and a very little amount of envelopes were signed together by the artist and the soldier.

**All money from these sales will be spent on equipment for Ukrainian soldiers. You will also receive photo reports.**  
You can see the auction with our envelopes here: [https://www.ebay.com/itm/Unique-FDC-Kyiv-envelope-signed-by-Roman-Gribov-and-Boris-Groh-Russian-warship/304495116761](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Unique-FDC-Kyiv-envelope-signed-by-Roman-Gribov-and-Boris-Groh-Russian-warship/304495116761)

Or one cheaper(because first day envelopes with a seal are the most expensive) at a fixed price: [https://www.ebay.com/usr/big-trout?\_trksid=p2047675.m3561.l2559](https://www.ebay.com/usr/big-trout?_trksid=p2047675.m3561.l2559)

 **Our center bought a car for Roman\`s military unit as a thankful gift for his signs. Soon Roman will return to fight and continue defending Ukraine from invaders.**

1. As I wake up next to yet another severed violated mother's head.
2. I transverse around the ruins searching for the next piece of bread.
3. &amp;#x200B;
4. From far away it looks like we are surprised and desperate trying to run from this condition.
5. But the cold reality is that fighting monsters is a historical repetition.
6. Living is important but life under them is a silly superstition.
7. Holding and shooting invaders is how we shall sign our resistive petition.
8. Just like our great ancestors, we shall honor this tradition.
9. Every small defeat is just a temporary reposition.
10. To every Ukrainian alive, oppression is the battle-engine ignition.
11. &amp;#x200B;
12. Between us, no condition.
13. We want peace. They competition.
14. Destroying what we are, that's their mission.
15. You have injustices, so you know our position.
16. Zelensky once was offered a tactical transition.
17. To which he promply replied:
18. I don't need a ride, what I need is ammunition.
19. &amp;#x200B;
20. For each of us, 10 orcs. 
21. They thought that ratio was scary. They thought it was their force. 
22. Interpreting our own way, we agree and reinforce:
23. For each of us, 10 orcs.
24. Hate is your shoe but courage is our horse.
25. You are big but empathy is our force.
26. By speaking truths to the world we gather more and more support.
27. The orc's heads are always heavy, ours know no remorse.
28. In our homeland, the fight will always follow our course.
29. You can burn and tape our mouths, but our hearts know morse.
30. You alone created the generation that will be forever anti-orcs.
31. The news of our victory will have only our flag as the source.
32. Justice and our future shall never ever see divorce.
33. After all these war crimes we will for sure meet in court.
34. Let's see when this ends how much will you export.
35. &amp;#x200B;
36. For the right to live and for our motherland, we fight.
37. Your shells bring the dark, but saint javelin the light.
38. The blue and yellow show the path of who in this is on the right.
39. You are putin stains in a flag that now everyone spite.
40. You took down our internet but underestimated Zelensky's sight.
41. Due to true diplomacy Sir. Musk became a knight.
42. Linking our stars to and through the stars even when not at night.
43. &amp;#x200B;
44. After the ultimate sleep, no one has any need.
45. So much loot in your pockets, but no sunflower seed.
46. You claim to have allies, but on the field, I see no Chinese.
47. So many of your troops gave up to fight for us and that's prior lend-lease.
48. Hoping for a disruption you threaten nuking every day indeed.
49. The only result of this is the growing feeling we should be freed.
50. &amp;#x200B;
51. Freed from tyranny and expansion. From what today you represent.
52. From the evil that an evil dictatorial government can present.
53. That can schedule a victory parade without the winning side's consent.
54. That can lie about the dead to not have to pay a cent.
55. That can rape babies on social media for likes and promoting content.
56. That can glue mines between children and their mothers with murderous intent.
57. That can order shelling to civilians only to generate torment.
58. That can kidnap more than 120.000 kids without telling where any of them went.
59. That invade our people's houses without never ever paying rent.
60. That moved millions as slaves claiming to be a savior and a saint.
61. I wonder if Hitler expected a matching successor to such a high percent.
62. &amp;#x200B;
63. I will say something impossible, hard to understand.
64. A message really really crazy, even harder to send.
65. Is it really that much impossible to imagine a neighbor as a friend?
66. Is disregarding your strategy until the very bitter end?
67. Is it really that confusing to know who attacks and who defends?
68. If your classes didn't call us monsters, would you even attend?
69. If you liked the food we cooked, would you even recommend it?
70. Do you really believe that from the blood of others yours can ascend?
71. Could from indignation a new anti-war culture in you ever transcend?
72. How many more of your children will your mothers for this war spend?
73. &amp;#x200B;
74. Those who sing the truth online are celebrative, modern, real-life bards.
75. We celebrate the internet support while holding our traumatized children in our arms.
76. We will continue to celebrate holidays even among your bombards.
77. Fighting and buying peace every day under our own graveyard\`s credit cards.
78. &amp;#x200B;
79. The world looking at us as the new brave European guards.
80. Buying peace for everyone.
81. Everyday.
82. In this forsaken, cruel, and unjust war.
83. With our graveyard\`s credit cards.

I was caught thinking a lot about Ukraine. Wanted to take some of my thoughts and feelings from my system and decided to write a poem/song about this war. 

I can't really sing nor have a nice voice for this but would like to see some interpretation of it. These kinds of things reach better those who need them when in sound/video format.
