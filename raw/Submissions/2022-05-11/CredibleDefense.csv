&gt; * Force Design began in response to known and anticipated changes in the operating environment, many of which were described in the 2018 National Defense Strategy… 

&gt; * The changes driving FD 2030, however, originated long before. They are rooted in the 31st Commandant’s Hunter Warrior (1997) and Urban Warrior (1998 – 1999) experiments and the 33rd Commandant’s Concept for Distributed Operations (July 2005). 

&gt; * Each of these helped shape the direction I gave in my Commandant’s Planning Guidance (CPG) of July 2019, when I identified Force Design as my top priority.

&gt; * …I expanded on the need for change in the articles “The Case for Change: Meeting the Principal Challenges Facing the Corps” (Marine Corps Gazette, June 2020) and “Preparing for the Future: Marine Corps Support to Joint Operations in Contested Littorals” (Military Review Online, April 2021), among others. 

&gt; * Today, world events emphasize our need to rapidly adapt in order to help the joint force deter, and if necessary, defeat, a peer competitor. 

&gt; * The tenets of the strategy—integrated deterrence, campaigning, and build enduring advantages—call for fresh thinking with respect to military capabilities. 

We are building a force capable of executing our concepts, not a force exclusively tailored to them. The Marine Corps remains an expeditionary crisis response force. 

&gt; * The outcomes of its wargames, analyses, experiments, and exercises underpin our investment and divestment decisions, 

&gt; * The security environment is characterized by proliferation of sophisticated sensors and precision weapons coupled with growing strategic competition. 

&gt; * Our FD 2030 communication has not been effective with all stakeholders. While we are modernizing the Marine Corps using the pacing threat as our benchmark, we have consistently said that a modernized Marine Corps must still be capable of performing global crisis response operations. Regardless, we must do better in explaining to all stakeholders the analytic rigor underpinning our Force Design choices, and how a modernized Marine Corps will perform our traditional roles and functions in the future. 

&gt; * As a complement to maneuver, deception is a core capability necessary to enhance survivability when operating forward regardless of assigned mission. This will require materiel and non- materiel solutions, to include a focus on refined tactics and associated training. 

&gt; * Campaign of Learning activities, such as our ENIGMA and EXPEDITIONARY WARRIOR 22 wargames, revealed gaps that inhibit the FMF’s ability to conduct steady- state RXR campaigning to enable MAGTF, naval, and joint awareness, threat characterization, and posture. 

&gt; * Maritime maneuver is of supreme importance. Littoral mobility remains a significant gap, a conclusion repeatedly validated across Campaign of Learning activities. 

&gt; * Sole reliance on armored ground vehicles for reconnaissance is too limiting, especially in complex littoral environments. 

&gt; * Fielding Multi-purpose Anti-armor Anti-personnel Weapon Systems (MAAWS) and loitering munitions within our small units provide the close-combat lethality enhancements long-envisioned by infantry Marines. While our company commanders will retain access to 60mm mortars for use depending on their estimate of the situation, force-on-force training repeatedly demonstrates the range, precision, and lethality of the new systems outperform 60mm mortars. 

&gt; * Logistics will be contested—in some respects, it is being contested now—by peer and near-peer competitors, along the entire length of the supply chain. 

&gt; * Through our “divest-to-modernize” approach, we deactivate legacy formations and retire systems that are less relevant to create new capabilities 

&gt; * Our divestments over the past two and half years resulted in $16 billion for reinvestment. 

&gt; * As we move aggressively to modernize the force, it is also important to make clear what is not changing. The Marine Corps’ congressionally mandated role as a balanced combined arms team that is “most ready when the Nation is least ready,” our ethos, our discipline, and our maneuver warfare approach is not changing.

*Momentous Changes in the U.S. Marine Corps’ Force Organization Deserve Debate. Retired generals raise telling questions about the current commandant’s radical new ideas.*

https://www.wsj.com/articles/momentous-changes-in-the-marine-corps-deserve-debate-reduction-david-berger-general-11648217667

&gt; * But what happens if a policy coming from the top of the chain of command is insufficiently tested or intrinsically flawed?

&gt; * Among Marines there are serious questions about the wisdom and long-term risk of dramatic reductions in force structure, weapon systems and manpower levels in units that would take steady casualties in most combat scenarios.

Among other decisions, Gen. Berger’s “Force Structure 2030” plan includes these provisions:

• Elimination of three infantry battalions from the current 24, a 14% reduction in frontline combat strength.
• Reduction of each remaining battalion by 200 Marines, taking an additional 4,200 infantry Marines from the frontline combat capabilities.
• Elimination of two reserve-component infantry battalions of the present eight, a 25% reduction of combat strength.
• Elimination of 16 cannon artillery battalions, a 76% reduction, to be replaced by 14 rocket artillery battalions, for use in “successful naval campaigns.”
• Elimination of all the tanks in the Marine Corps, even from the reserves.
• Elimination of three of the current 17 medium tilt-rotor squadrons, three of the eight heavy-lift helicopter squadrons, and “at least” two of the seven light attack helicopter squadrons, which were termed “unsuitable for maritime challenges.”

&gt; * After several unsuccessful attempts by retired senior officers to engage in a quiet dialogue with Gen. Berger, the gloves have now come off.

&gt; * Gen. Berger’s announcement came during the Covid restrictions, when much of Congress had gone remote, and serious examination and oversight was extremely difficult. 

&gt; * If Gen. Berger’s new ideas were well thought out and tested, we would be seeing 90% of retired generals enthusiastically supporting them instead of expressing concern.

*A View From the Trenches on the Debate Wracking the Marine Corps*  May 6th 2022

https://warontherocks.com/2022/05/a-view-from-the-trenches-on-the-debate-wracking-the-marine-corps/

&gt; * The character of war has changed. We will either adapt or perish.

&gt; * This debate has provided many perspectives that are all important for the Marine Corps and the United States, but surprisingly the debate has overshadowed what Force Design 2030 is already doing at the tactical level…

&gt; * This is the American way of war. We do not kill civilians intentionally. So I asked again: “What now, Lieutenant? You don’t have fire support, and only organic machine guns against a numerically superior enemy who has massed fires. So, what now?” He broke his gaze from downrange and stared at me in shock and said that we had to break contact — to retreat.

&gt; * The timeliness and responsiveness of fires, and their release authority, have always plagued light infantry units. These problems have only been exacerbated by technology and the ability of the higher headquarters, focused on the strategic and operational levels of combat, to have direct involvement in tactical decisions and actions.

&gt; * Light infantry units have been overly dependent on non-organic fire support that has only fallen victim to kill-chain micromanagement.

&gt; *  General Berger’s decision to take advantage of the democratization of airpower, providing these weapon systems to the Marine infantry, proved to have similar effects for Alpha Company. Instead of marines only being able to “suppress” the enemy reserve element during their attack, they were now able to “destroy” it, at ranges far exceeding the engagement criteria set in planning.

&gt; * The speed and lethality that was delivered by 1st Battalion, 2nd Marines with their hyper-enabled small units is all part of the experimentation being conducted by the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory in support of Force Design 2030.

&gt; * In 2021, however, a young captain involved in the experimentation presented a problem to the training control group that runs the range that now, miles away from Range 410, even from Camp Wilson, with organic intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and targeting drones and precision loitering munitions, the marines can destroy every target on the range from beyond line of sight, so the dilemma fell on the control group, what now? How do we evaluate platoon attacks with platoons that have these types of capabilities?

&gt; * Now, when asked “What now, Lieutenant?” you get a sheepish grin, and a “Watch this, Gunner.”

*Chief Warrant Officer (Marine Gunner) Stephen W. LaRose is a member of the Close Combat Lethality Task Force. He is also a veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as various other operations around the globe. He is the recipient of two Bronze Stars and was awarded the 2013 Hulbert Trophy for outstanding leadership by a Marine gunner. The opinions and views expressed here are not those of the Close Combat Lethality Task Force, the Marine Corps, the Department of Defense, or the U.S. government.*

*The Marine Corps’ Radical Shift toward China* March 25th 2020 

https://www.csis.org/analysis/marine-corps-radical-shift-toward-china?fbclid=IwAR3Fl1vg8SMaBOt1iaz_ZmV11fymgoNL770NSWD07l48EYWCI530XNXqE94

&gt; * Last July, General Berger electrified the national security community with planning guidance that proposed to align the Marine Corps with the National Defense Strategy (NDS) by making major changes to forces, equipment, and training.

&gt; * For many years, strategists have yearned to refocus the military services on the Pacific and China. China, with its growing economy, modernizing military, and evident desire to reassert regional hegemony

&gt; * …the National Defense Strategy (NDS) called for changes in military forces: “We cannot expect success fighting tomorrow’s conflicts with yesterday’s weapons or equipment.” 

&gt; * The NDS also signaled that modernization was more important than the size of the force, implying a willingness to get smaller in order to build the capabilities needed for great power conflict. 

&gt; * General David Berger became commandant of the Marine Corps on July 11, 2019. He immediately published his Commandant’s Planning Guidance , which laid out his vision for where the Marine Corps needed to go. New service chiefs typically produce such documents, but most are exhortations to seek excellence in the services’ traditional missions and to implement a few targeted reforms that the new chief desires to focus on. General Berger’s vision was different in that it implied major changes in many areas.

&gt; * Central to Berger’s vision is the ability to operate within an adversary’s (read China’s) bubble of air, missile, and naval power (which the Marine Corps calls the weapons engagement zone, or WEZ).

&gt; * The concept is that the Marine Corps will be a “stand-in force” that will operate within this WEZ, not a stand-off force that must start outside and fight its way in.

&gt; * This requires developing “low signature, affordable, and risk worthy platforms” because existing ships and aircraft are the opposite—highly capable but expensive, few, and highly visible.

&gt; * Thus, small Marine forces would deploy around the islands of the first island chain and the South China Sea, each element having the ability to contest the surrounding air and naval space using anti-air and antiship missiles. Collectively, these forces would attrite Chinese forces, inhibit them from moving outward, and ultimately, as part of a joint campaign, squeeze them back to the Chinese homeland.

&gt; * A third element was institutional: the Marine Corps would leave sustained ground combat to the Army and focus on the littorals. Ground wars in the Middle East, North Korea, and Europe would be Army responsibilities.

&gt; * …unlike in the previous five years, when rising budgets allowed new investment and stable force levels, trade-offs would now be necessary. If the Marine Corps wanted to invest in new capabilities, it had to cut some existing units.

&gt; * Implementation will be a 10-year effort that makes the radical changes that the guidance implied. 

&gt; * Radical change brings risks, and this effort is no different. If the Marine Corps has misjudged the future, it will fight the next conflict at a great disadvantage or, perhaps, be irrelevant.

&gt; * Although the NDS allows hedging against other adversaries and conflicts—North Korea, Iran, counterterrorism—the Marine Corps does not plan to do that.

&gt; * The Marine Corps has sensibly conducted a lot of war-gaming and satisfied itself that the concept will succeed. However, as Marines note, the enemy gets a vote.
