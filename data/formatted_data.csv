5,"&gt;the US can obliterate the russians in a straight fight.

Doubt it. Since WW2, every war America has started they always had a severe military technology advantage over their enemy and always had the luxury of air superiority and they still couldn't win a war. Russia is one of few countries that has the financial and engineering clout to fight back and also has similar man and land power by numbers. America struggled with much weaker enemies, I really do not want the US and us UK folk to start a pissing contest and call Putin's bluff. Having a direct war with Russia is a complete different ball game to terry Taliban and Jihadi John in some dusty cave.",C,.,\,5,en

24,"It's old outdated crap.  Russian equipment is ok for a 3rd world dictator trying to put down an unarmed rebellion.  On a modern battlefield it's outdated garbage.  They don't have modern protection on tanks.  Their jets are obsolete, lack any real radar protection or real radar capabilities. The ADA is their pride and joy but hasn't been effective in decades.  Israel blew a bunch up just recently and flies in and out of Syria completely unopposed.  

Their communications and intelligence is shit.  NATO has flaunted its ability to not only know every move Russia is making but also to publish publicly in a dare for Putin to stop them and he could not.  His troops could see their orders on the news before they got them.  Russia hasn't been able to secure battlefield communications and NATO reported that the Russians on the border were in a panicked state.  Javelins are awesome tech but there's much crazier shit NATO is holding back because Russia alone isn't a military peer.  Russia's tactics and strategy are just as outdated.  

The Russian military isn't a modern military and this isn't a modern war.  They did have a decent propaganda team for a little while but as soon as people became focused on the war and did a little research he lost that edge and it fell apart.  

Russia calling its military modern is getting kind of stale.  It's just bad propaganda.",C,.,\,24,en
